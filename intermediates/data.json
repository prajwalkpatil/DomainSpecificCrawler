He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Modi, a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is a Hindu nationalist and member of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Born to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child, and later ran his own stall. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. He left home after graduating from school, partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected. Modi traveled around India for two years, and visited a number of religious centres. He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary. Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots, or otherwise criticised for its handling of it, although a court found no evidence to prosecute Modi. His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise. His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education indices in the state. Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election, which gave the party a majority in the Lok Sabha, the first time a single party had achieved this since 1984. Modi himself was elected to parliament from Varanasi. Since taking office, Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, increased spending on infrastructure, and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy, and centralised power through the abolition of the Planning Commission. He has begun a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Credited with engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda. Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c.1915 - 1989) and Hiraben Modi (born c.1920). Modi's family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community, which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government. As a child, Modi helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus. Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, with an interest in theatre. Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and this was noted by his teachers and students. Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image. When eight years old, Modi discovered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) for RSS and became his political mentor. While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980. Engaged while still a child to Jashodaben, a girl from a family who lived close by, Modi rejected the arranged marriage at the same time he graduated from high school. The resulting familial tensions contributed to his decision to leave home in 1967. Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he went have emerged. In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education. Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi's life. In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which Modi wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati. Modi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968\u201369. Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad. There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation. In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city. After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS, working under Inamdar. Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him. Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001. In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from School of Open Learning at University of Delhi, graduating with a third class. Five years later, in 1982, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University, as an external distance learning student. In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as \"The Emergency\", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned. Modi was appointed general secretary of the \"Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\", an RSS committee coordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned. Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations. Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists. During this period, Modi wrote a book in Gujarati, Sangharsh MA Gujarat (In The Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency. Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes, as well as several other national political figures. In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a Sikh. Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency. He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers. After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987. Modi rose within the party and was named a member of the BJP's National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise L. K. Advani's 1990 Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991\u201392 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity). However, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in Ahmedabad; friction with Shankersingh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played a part in this decision. Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani, and as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state Assembly elections. In November of that year Modi was elected BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections. Modi, on the selection committee for the 1998 Assembly elections in Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as key to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections, and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year. In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001. The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement. Although BJP leader L. K. Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was \"going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all\". On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections. On 7 October 2001, Modi was administered the oath of office. On 24 February 2002 he entered the Gujarat state legislature by winning a by-election to the Rajkot \u2013 II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC by 14,728 votes, which enabled him to take office. On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people. The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid. In making a public statement after the incident, Modi said that the attack had been terror attack planned by local Muslims. The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh across the state. Riots began during the bandh, and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat. The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence. The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed. Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000. Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps. Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women. The government of Gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots, and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation. Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom, while others have called it an example of state terrorism. Summarising academic views on the subject, Martha Nussbaum said: \"There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law.\" The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating. The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh, despite such actions being illegal at the time. State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there. Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court. During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able. In 2012 Maya Kodnani, a minister in Modi's government from 2007 to 2009, was convicted of participation in the Naroda Patiya massacre during the 2002 riots. Although Modi's government had announced that it would seek the death penalty for Kodnani on appeal, it reversed its decision in 2013. Modi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, Modi said that \"What is happening is a chain of action and reaction.\" Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode. Modi has not offered an apology for the riots. In March 2008, the Supreme Court reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue. In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri (widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre), in April 2009 the court also asked the SIT to investigate the issue of Modi's complicity in the killings. The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him. In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT's position, he said that Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence. The Supreme Court gave the matter to the magistrate's court. The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jaffri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013 the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister. In the aftermath of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue. Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted. His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved. Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002. In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly. Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign, and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters. Modi hired the public relations firm APCO Worldwide to manage his image. He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 1,13,589 of 1,54,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes. On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term. Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly. During Modi's second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development. Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP. Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a forward to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies. Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister) distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots. Questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed under the aegis of the International Religious Freedom Act, the only person denied a US visa under this law. The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington. During the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism. In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \"\u00a0for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a \"spiritual experience\" for Dalits. However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct. After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat's 1,600-kilometre (990\u00a0mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats. In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post, and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election. As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth \u20b96.6\u00a0trillion were signed. The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them. Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010. As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India. The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4\u20136% of the area intended. Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent \u2013 the highest of any state. However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992\u201397 INC government was 12.9 percent. In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata's to Gujarat. The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed. Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised, according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers. There has been a contentious debate surrounding the development of the state of Gujarat during Modi's tenure as chief minister. The GDP growth rate of Gujarat averaged 10% during Modi's tenure, a value above that of the country as a whole, and similar to other highly industrialised states. Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office. Some scholars have stated the rate of growth did not accelerate during Modi's tenure, although the state is considered to have maintained a high growth rate during Modi's Chief Ministership. Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank's \"ease of doing business\" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years. In 2013, Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for \"economic freedom\" by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states. In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism. Tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states, as was land. Modi's policies to make Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones, where labour laws were greatly weakened. Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the \"alarming\" category on the India State Hunger Index. A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found that Gujarat under Modi had a poor record with respect to immunisation in children. Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states. It showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined. With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below most Indian states. The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits, and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities. Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index. Political Scientist Christophe Jaffrelot says that under Modi the number of families below the poverty line has increased and conditions for rural adivasi and dalits, in particular, have declined. Under Modi, the state government spent far less than the national average on education and healthcare. In July 2013, economics Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen expressed disapproval of Modi's governance record, saying that under his administration Gujarat's \"record in education and healthcare is pretty bad\". However, economists Arvind Panagariya and Jagdish Bhagwati say that Gujarat's social indicators have improved from a lower baseline than that of other Indian states. According to them, Gujarat's performance in raising literacy rates has been superior to other states and the \"rapid\" improvement of health indicators is evidence that \"its progress has not been poor by any means.\" During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India. Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders. He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra. His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012. He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji (\"Guru worthy of worship\"). According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children. While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people, something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt. The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995). In later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates. In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests by Indian-Americans. After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014. Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister. In September 2013 Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modi's candidature, including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were \"concerned with their personal agendas\". Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's election campaign. Several people who voted for the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party. The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign. The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi. During the campaign, Modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous INC government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat. Modi projected himself as a person who could bring about \"development,\" without focus on any specific policies. His message found support among young Indians and among middle-class citizens. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism. Prior to the election Modi's image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, but during the campaign the BJP was able to shift this to a focus on Modi's neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development. Although the BJP avoided issues of Hindu nationalism to an extent, Hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign. The BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media. Modi's campaign blitz cost approximately \u20b950 billion (US$780\u00a0million), and received extensive financial support from corporate donors. In addition to more conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media, and addressed more than 1000 rallies via hologram appearances. The BJP won 31% of the vote, and more than doubled its tally in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984. Voter dissatisfaction with the INC, as well as with regional parties in North India, was another reason for the success of the BJP, as was the support from the RSS. In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before. It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims. The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the right-wing. Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism. Modi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies: Varanasi and Vadodara. He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi and Madhusudan Mistry of the INC in Vadodara by 570,128 votes. Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, was appointed prime minister by India's president. To comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat. Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014 at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. He became the first Prime Minister born after India's independence from the British Empire. His first cabinet consisted of 45 ministers, 25 fewer than the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. 21 new ministers were added to the council of ministers in November 2014. The economic policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, based on a neoliberal framework. Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other reforms included removing many of the country's labour laws, to make it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them. These reforms met with support from institutions such as the World Bank, but opposition from scholars within the country. The labour laws also drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the reforms would hurt labourers by making it easier for corporations to exploit them. In his first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised to gradually reduce the budgetary deficit from 4.1 percent to 3 percent over two years, and to divest from shares in public banks. Over Modi's first year in office, the Indian GDP grew at a rate of 7.5 percent, making it the world's fastest-growing large economy. The funds dedicated to poverty reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly decreased by the Modi administration. The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6% of GDP during the Congress government to 12.6% during Modi's first year in office. Spending on health and family welfare declined by 15%, and on primary and secondary education by 16%. The budgetary allocation for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, or the \"education for all\" programme, declined by 22%. The government also lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, and reduced customs duties on gold, jewelry, and increased sales taxes. In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices, and later increased taxes on diesel and petrol. In September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub. Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it. Under the previous bill, the government had required the consent of 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. Modi's government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017. On 25 June 2015, Modi launched a programme intended to develop 100 smart cities. The \"Smart Cities\" programme is expected to bring Information Technology companies an extra benefit of \u20b920 billion (US$310\u00a0million). In June 2015, Modi launched the \"Housing for All By 2022\" project, which intends to eliminate slums in India by building about 20 million affordable homes for India's urban poor. In his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate black money. On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised \u20b9500 and \u20b91000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism. The move led to widespread protests throughout the country, including one by opposition parties, which stalled the winter session of parliament. In the days following the demonetisation, banks across the country faced severe cash shortages, which had detrimental effects on a number of small businesses, on agriculture, and on transportation. People seeking to exchange their notes had lengthy waits, and several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash. Following Modi's announcement, the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 declined steeply. There has been a steep increase in digital payments and transactions in the country since the day demonetization was announced. Post the demonetisation, the quantum of income tax returns filed for individuals jumped by 25% indicating the widened tax net. Further, the advance tax collections rose by 42% and Self assessment tax collections rose by 34.25%. In his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the amount of money spent by the government on healthcare. The Modi government launched a \"New Health Policy\" in January 2015, although this did not increase the government's spending on healthcare, instead emphasizing the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including reducing child and maternal mortality rates. The National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices received nearly 25% less funds in 2015 than in the previous year. 15 national health programmes, including those aimed at controlling tobacco use and supporting healthcare for the elderly, were merged with the National Health Mission, and received less funds than in previous years. Modi initially appointed Harsh Vardhan, a doctor and an advocate of tobacco control, as minister of health. However, Vardhan was removed in November 2015. The government introduced stricter packaging laws for tobacco which requires 85% of the packet size to be covered by pictorial warnings. In its budget for the second year after it took office, the Modi government reduced healthcare spending by 15%. Modi has generally emphasised his government's efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health. An article in the medical journal Lancet stated that the country \"might have taken a few steps back in public health\" under Modi. On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (\"Clean India\") campaign. The stated goals of the campaign included eliminating open defecation and manual scavenging. The plan was to achieve these aims in five years. As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them. The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants. The administration plans to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the toilets constructed for them. During the 2014 election campaign, the BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders known to have opposed Hindu nationalism, including B. R. Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Ram Manohar Lohia. The campaign also saw the use of rhetoric based on Hindutva, however, by BJP leaders in certain states. Communal tensions were played upon especially in Uttar Pradesh and the states of Northeast India. A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code was a part of the BJP's election manifesto. Several state governments headed by the BJP have enacted policies aligned with Hindutva after the election of Modi as prime minister. The government of Maharashtra banned the killing of cows in 2014. The Modi administration has generally avoided directly supporting policies related to a Hindutva agenda. There has been an increase in the activities of a number of other Hindu nationalist organisations, sometimes with the support of the government. The incidents included a Hindu religious conversion programme, a campaign against the alleged Islamic practice of \"Love Jihad\", and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right wing Hindu Mahasabha. The attempts at religious conversion have been described by the VHP and other organisations involved with them as attempts at \"reconversion\" from Islam or Christianity. There have been a number of reports of intimidation or coercion of the subjects during these attempts. Officials in the government, including the Home Minister, have defended the attempts. There were additional incidents of violence targeted at religious minorities by Hindu nationalists. Modi refused to remove a government minister from her position after a popular outcry resulted from her referring to religious minorities as \"bastards.\" Commentators have suggested, however, that the violence was perpetrated by radical Hindu nationalists to undercut the authority of Modi. The Modi administration appointed Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR). In reaction to his appointment, other historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the ruling party, questioned his credentials as a historian. Several stated that the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism. The government began formulating a New Education Policy, or NEP, soon after its election. As of March 2016, this policy had yet to be implemented. This was the third education policy introduced by the Indian government, following those of 1968 and 1986. The policy was described as having overtones of Hindutva. The RSS had a role in its creation, and it did not explicitly mention the goals of \"socialism, secularism and democracy\" that had been mentioned in the first two policies. The policy emphasised the education of minority students, as well as those of economically backward groups, in particular on improving enrolment in schools among those groups. The policy proposed bringing religious educational institutions under the Right to Education Act. There was also a debate about removing caste-based reservation in favour of reservation based on income, a move supported by the RSS, but which was criticised as being discriminatory on the basis of caste. Foreign policy played a relatively small role in Modi's election campaign, and did not feature prominently in the BJP's election manifesto. Modi invited all the other leaders of SAARC countries to his swearing in ceremony as prime minister. He was the first Indian prime minister to do so. Modi's foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding INC government, focused on improving economic ties, security, and regional relations. Modi continued Manmohan Singh's policy of \"multialignment.\" The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially in East Asia, with the use of slogans such as \"Make in India\" and \"Digital India\". As a part of this policy, the Modi government completed India's application to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which is led by China and Russia. (SCO). The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as with Israel. Modi added five bilateral strategic partnerships to the 25 that had been agreed by his predecessors Singh and Vajpayee. During the first few months after the election, Modi made trips to a number of different countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits. One of Modi's first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid. Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country. While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries. In 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land exchange deal with Bangladesh about the India\u2013Bangladesh enclaves, which had been initiated by the government of Manmohan Singh. Modi's administration gave renewed attention to India's \"Look East Policy\", instituted in 1991. The policy was renamed the \"Act East Policy\", and involved directing Indian foreign policy towards East Asia and Southeast Asia. The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with Myanmar, through the state of Manipur. This represented a break with India's historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade. As of July 2016, Modi had made 51 trips to 42 countries with the intent of strengthening diplomatic relations. The BJP election manifesto had also promised to deal with illegal immigration into India in the Northeast, as well as to be more firm in its handling of insurgent groups. During the election campaign, Modi said that he would be willing to accommodate Hindu migrants who were being persecuted in Bangladesh, but those that came with \"political objectives\" would have to be sent back. The Modi government issued a notification allowing Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to legalise their residency in India. The government described the measure as being taken for humanitarian reasons but it drew criticism from several Assamese organisations. Modi continued the previous INC administration's policy of increasing military spending every year, announcing an increase of 11% in the military budget in 2015. This increase was larger than the average growth under the Congress. The Modi administration negotiated a peace agreement with the largest faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCM), which was announced in August 2015. The Naga insurgency in northwest India had begun in the 1950s. The NSCM and the government had agreed to a ceasefire in 1997, but a peace accord had not previously been signed. In 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the Khaplang faction of the NSCM (NSCM-K). The NSCM-K responded with a series of attacks, which killed 18 people. The Modi government carried out a raid across the border with Myanmar as a result, and labelled the NSCM-K a terrorist organisation. Modi has repeatedly stated that Pakistan was an exporter of terrorism. On 29 September 2016, the Indian Army stated that it had conducted a surgical strike on terror launchpads in Azad Kashmir, although Pakistan denied the claim, and the details of the confrontation are still in dispute. In naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the \"Ministry of Environment and Forests\" the \"Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change.\" In the first budget of the government, the money allotted to this ministry was reduced by more than 50%. The new ministry also removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection. These included no longer requiring clearance from the National Board for Wildlife for projects close to protected areas, and allowing certain projects to proceed before environmental clearance was received. The government also tried to reconstitute the Wildlife board such that it no longer had representatives from non-governmental organisations: however, this move was prevented by the Supreme Court. Modi also relaxed or abolished a number of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists. Under the UPA government that preceded Modi's administration, field trials of Genetically Modified (GM) crops had essentially been put on hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods. Under the Modi government these restrictions were gradually lifted. The government received some criticism for freezing the bank accounts of environmental group Greenpeace, citing financial irregularities, although a leaked government report said that the freeze had to do with Greenpeace's opposition to GM crops. Modi's first year as prime minister saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations. Modi's efforts at centralisation have been linked to an increase in the number of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary. On 31 December 2014, Modi announced that the Planning Commission had been scrapped. It was replaced with a body called the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog. The Planning Commission was a legacy of the Indian Independence movement, although critics said that it was slowing economic growth. The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister. It also reduced the extent of control individual states had over their financial allocation from the union government, and unlike the planning commission, it does not have the power to allocate funds. The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice. The Modi government launched a crackdown against a number of civil society organisations. Several tens of thousands of organisations were investigated by the Intelligence Bureau in the first year of the administration, on the grounds that they were slowing economic growth. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure. Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz. Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi's style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi. Modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister, against a total of 1,301 such laws repealed by previous governments over a span of 64 years. He started a monthly radio programme titled \"Mann Ki Baat\" on 3 October 2014. Modi also launched the Digital India programme, which has the goal of ensuring that government services are available electronically, building infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boosting manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promoting digital literacy. In accordance with Ghanchi tradition, Modi's marriage was arranged by his parents when he was a child. He was engaged at age 13 to Jashodaben, marrying her when he was 18. They spent little time together and grew apart when Modi began two years of travel, including visits to Hindu ashrams. Reportedly, their marriage was never consummated, and he kept it a secret because otherwise he could not have become a 'pracharak' in the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh. Although Modi kept his marriage secret for most of his career, he acknowledged his wife when he filed his nomination for a parliamentary seat in the 2014 general elections. Modi maintains a close relationship with his mother, Hiraben and often visits her on his birthday to seek her blessings. A vegetarian, Modi has a frugal lifestyle and is a workaholic and introvert. Adept at using social media, he has been since September 2014 the second-most-followed leader in the world (with over 25.8 million followers on Twitter as of December 2016), behind only Barack Obama. Modi's 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with netizens on live chat. Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, as well as for a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. Modi's personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic. The nomination of Modi for the prime ministership drew attention to his reputation as \"one of contemporary India's most controversial and divisive politicians.\" During the 2014 election campaign the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader, who would be able to take difficult decisions. Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, in a manner unusual for the BJP and RSS. Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and \"development\". Nonetheless, his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy. Modi's hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda. As prime minister, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings; at the end of his first year in office, he received an overall approval rating of 87% in a Pew Research poll, with 68% of people rating him \"very favorably\" and 93% approving of his government. His approval rating remained largely consistent at around 74% through his second year in office, according to a nationwide poll conducted by instaVaani. At the end of his second year in office, an updated Pew Research poll showed Modi continued to receive high overall approval ratings of 81%, with 57% of those polled rating him \"very favorably.\" At the end of his third year in office, The Times of India poll showed that 77% of the respondents rated him as \"very good\" and \"good\".  Modi was named the Best Chief Minister in a 2007 nationwide survey by India Today. In March 2012, he appeared on the cover of the Asian edition of Time Magazine, one of the few Indian politicians to have done so. He was awarded Indian of the Year by CNN-IBN news network in 2014. In 2014, 2015 and 2017, he was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World. He was also declared winner of the Time magazine reader's poll for Person of the Year in 2014, a feat which he repeated again in 2016. Forbes Magazine ranked him the 15th-Most-Powerful Person in the World in 2014 and the 9th-Most-Powerful Person in the World in 2015 and 2016. In 2015, Modi was ranked the 13th-Most-Influential Person in the World by Bloomberg Markets Magazine. In the same year he was named one of Time's \"30 Most Influential People on the Internet\" as the second-most-followed politician on Twitter and Facebook. Modi was ranked fifth on Fortune Magazine's first annual list of the \"World's Greatest Leaders\" in 2015. In 2016, a wax statue of Modi was unveiled at Madame Tussaud Wax Museum in London."], "https://indianexpress.com/article/research/pranab-mukherjee-ram-nath-kovind-did-you-know-the-post-of-indian-president-finds-its-inspiration-in-the-british-monarchy-4765104/": [" India\u2019s season of presidential elections has been on for the past few weeks with former Bihar governor Ram Nath Kovind making his way to the Rashtrapati Bhawan and Pranab Mukherjee bidding farewell to it after a successful full term. The office of the President, in which rests the highest authority in the country and also a position of glory, is one of the most prominent residues of the long period of British rule in India, and yet in many ways, is in marked opposition to it. The Presidential Office in India, akin to that of the British monarch and also representative of the democracy embedded in the country\u2019s Constitution, is a product of a long drawn out period of toil by members of the Constituent Assembly, poring over constitutions of countries across the world, to come up with a political and civil framework, best suited for the gigantic needs of Independent India. When India became independent she had initially given dominion status within the commonwealth nations. King George VI remained its head, and his representative authority in India was vested in the office of the Governor General. Consequently, under the leadership of B R Ambedkar, the Constituent Assembly went on to frame the Constitution, which on coming into force in January 1950, making India a republic. In the process of drafting the constitution of the country, the assembly was soon met with the question of the head of the state. As chairman of the assembly, Dr Rajendra Prasad had made the following observation of the office of the president. \u201cWe considered whether we should adopt the American model or the British model where we have a hereditary King who is the fountain of all honour and power, but who does not actually enjoy any power. All the power rests in the legislature to which the Ministers are responsible. We have had to reconcile the position of an elected President with an elected legislature and in doing so, we have adopted more or less the position of the British monarch for the President. His position is that of a constitutional President, Then we come to the Ministers. They are of course responsible to the legislature and tender advice to the President who is bound to act according to that advice. Although there are no sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 provisions, as far as I know, in the Constitution itself making it binding on the President to accept the advice of the ministers, it is hoped that the convention under which in England the King acts always on the advice of his ministers will be established in this country also.\u201d When the Constitution makers put together the document, they did not stick to any particular model, but drew widely from a large number of constitutions with the idea of picking the best features of every country\u2019s administrative framework. The office of the President is perhaps the best illustration of this fact. It is an unusual blend of the British Crown and the American President. On one hand, in their attempt to break away from the Crown\u2019s rule, the Constitution makers opted for the American system of an elective head. At the same time, the post of the President was made almost powerless along the British model. Soon after a debate arose on the nature of election procedure to select the president. When the draft was being formed, some members of the assembly asked for direct election of the president, on the ground that would bring about a sense of unity in the country. There were others who believed that the electoral college consisting of members of the Parliament and of the Legislative Assemblies would not sufficiently represent the people\u2019s will. However, the Constituent Assembly did not accept the arguments and went ahead with the indirect form of election for the presidential office. While providing the rationale behind why an indirect election is preferable, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru said the following: \u201cThe framers of the Indian Constitution wanted to emphasise the ministerial character of the Government that power really resided in the Ministry and in the Legislature and not in the President as such . ..Now, therefore, if we had an election by adult franchise and yet did not give him any real powers, it might become slightly anomalous.\u201d He further added that a direct election would lead to an extraordinary expense of time, energy and money without any adequate result. Nehru\u2019s arguments favouring indirect elections were further reinforced by the reasoning of B R Ambedkar. He made three important points on the matter. First, the size of the electorate in India being 158.5 million, as against the 75 million in America would make it difficult to adopt adult suffrage in electing the president. Second, he mentioned that the country lacked sufficient administrative machinery to carry out an election procedure of this nature. Third, Ambedkar argued that the President of India is simply a figurehead and has no real powers to execute and so a direct election for his position is not necessary. \u201cI, therefore, submit that, having regard to the size of the electorate, the paucity of administrative machinery, necessary to manage elections on such a vast scale and that the President does not possess any of the executive or administrative powers which the President of the United States possesses, it is unnecessary to go into the question of adult suffrage and to provide for the election of the President on that basis.\u201d noted Ambedkar. Another reason cited for an indirectly elected president was that an electoral campaign on the part of the president would lead to electoral excitement and party feelings which is unnecessary for being in power independently.

You may order presentation ready copies to distribute to your colleagues, customers, or clients, by visiting https://www.parsintl.com/publication/autoblog/ I was really hoping this one wasn\u2019t going to need writing, but there seems to be no end in sight for the scourge that is \u201cpiano black trim.\u201d I\u2019m talking about the glossy black trim that has somehow become a luxurious trim used to class up interiors that might otherwise be lacking in class. Last week\u2019s L.A. Auto Show reveals showcased plenty of it. Both the new Subaru Solterra and Toyota bZ4X are featuring piano black plastic in exactly the wrong places. Same goes for the new Kia Sportage, but these few examples are just a blip in what is a whole industry-wide obsession with glossy black. This shiny trim looks good in fancy press photos of new car interiors, but it stops looking good soon after the photoshoot is finished. Anyone who owns a car with piano black trim already knows what happens to it over time. First, it gets coated in dust and particles \u2014 this only takes a day or two. Next, and this part takes a few months to a year, it gets terribly scratched up and generally looks horrible. It may just be the least durable interior trim material ever invented, and now it\u2019s used on untold numbers of new cars.  Anecdotally speaking, the use of piano black trim has grown recently, and it continues to grow. In most cases, it\u2019s replacing plastic that might otherwise have a flat black or gray finish. Those flat, non-flashy trim pieces hold up to years of abuse and don't get dirty anywhere near as easily as piano black does. That begs the question, why have automakers decided to flock to the new piano-black-everything style? Perhaps, piano black interior trim is more effective at selling cars. We humans have a tendency to be drawn to shiny things like diamond rings and expensive watches. If one interior wows us with its sparkling flare where another is dull, it stands to reason that we could end up choosing the one that hit us with that initial \u201cwow\u201d factor.  Even as the trend runs full steam ahead, some are making a point about fighting back against piano black trim. Honda designed the new Civic\u2019s center console without any piano black trim on purpose, instead opting for a lined, gray plastic. It\u2019s not going to scratch or become dirty like piano black does, but it\u2019s still a visually interesting piece of trim that is superior to no design at all.\u00a0 This kind of intentional design is exactly what I\u2019d love to see happen, too. Let\u2019s get rid of any piano black trim that sits flat in the interior or is going to be subject to our frequent touch. If it\u2019s flat, it\u2019s going to collect dust instantly. If we touch it often or set things on it, the trim will scratch and quickly lose its luster. The only areas where piano black trim is acceptable are in spots that are vertical and in places where our fingerprints won\u2019t frequently smudge it. Our long-term Hyundai Palisade mostly executes on this rule by limiting the piano black trim to certain areas like the infotainment surround, while utilizing a metal-like silver trim in high-impact spots. And while we\u2019re on this trim rant, let me also call out carbon fiber interior trim as another played-out trend. Any car with an inkling of performance seems to either be fitted with as standard (or offer as an option) carbon interior trim. I was once enamored with the idea of seeing carbon fiber in as many places as I can, but those days are long gone. Now, it just looks tired and cheap.  I still appreciate the use of carbon fiber for any exterior parts like the rear spoiler or side sills \u2014 full-carbon cars have their place, too \u2014 but its purpose is largely wasted on the interior. If the carbon trim were legitimately cutting real pounds off, then I\u2019d be all for it. But for such limited use on the interior (strips on the dash, door or center console surround) it\u2019s not cutting any tangible weight, and a beautiful wood or patterned metal trim would look significantly more luxurious. Not to mention, the cost of adding carbon fiber trim is typically higher or similar to that of a far more lavish alternative. I\u2019d much rather stare at an open pore walnut dash than one spackled with carbon fiber. And don\u2019t even get me started on carbon fiber-trimmed steering wheels. The carbon behaves like all the metal in the car on hot days, becoming impossible to touch for the first several minutes of driving \u2014 that\u2019s not a good quality to have in a steering device. So, let\u2019s say goodbye to both piano black and carbon fiber interior trim. The former is simply a poor idea for your interior\u2019s longevity, and the latter has numerous, more attractive alternatives.

R. College, Nellore. Later, he acquired a bachelor's degree in law with specialisation in international law from Andhra University College of Law, Visakhapatnam.[10][11] He was a swayamsevak in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and joined ABVP during his college days. He was elected as the president of the students' union of colleges affiliated to the Andhra University. He came into the spotlight for his prominent role in the Jai Andhra Movement of 1972. While Kakani Venkata Ratnam led the movement from Vijayawada, Naidu took active part in the agitation in Nellore, until it was called off a year later.\n In 1974, he became the convener of the anti-corruption Jayaprakash Narayan Chhatra Sangharsh Samiti of Andhra Pradesh. He took to the streets in protest against the Emergency and was imprisoned. From 1977 to 1980, he was president of its youth wing.\n Both as a student leader and political figure, Naidu gained prominence as an orator, who championed the cause of the farmers and the development of backward areas. His oratory skills and political activism propelled his political career and he was elected as an MLA to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly twice from Udaygiri constituency in Nellore district in 1978 and 1983. He rose to become one of the most popular leaders of the BJP in Andhra Pradesh.[weasel\u00a0words][citation needed]\n After serving in various organisational posts of the BJP at the state and national level, he was elected as a member of the Rajya Sabha from Karnataka in 1998.[12] He was re-elected twice, in 2004 and 2010, from Karnataka.[13][14] He served as the party spokesperson from 1996 to 2000, bringing to the job his panache for quirky alliterations and similes. Unlike most politicians from southern India, Naidu made an effort to master Hindi, going on to address public rallies in northern India.[citation needed]\n After the NDA victory in the 1999 general elections, he became the Union Cabinet Minister for Rural Development in the government headed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.[15] He was known for aggressively pushing for reforms in rural development and for the many schemes introduced during this period such as the 'Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.'[16][17][18]\n Naidu succeeded Jana Krishnamurthi as the National President of the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2003.[19] On 28 January 2004, he was elected unopposed for a full three-year term.[20] After the defeat of the BJP-led NDA in the 2004 general elections, he resigned from his post on 18 October 2004 and was succeeded by L.

Sombhai said the marriage was forced on Modi by his parents when he was a teenager in keeping with the old orthodox tradition of fixing marriages between children and that it was never consummated as Modi walked out of the marriage soon after it was solemnised. Dwelling on the reasons of the Gujarat Chief Minister's act, Sombhai said a young Modi did it in response to an inner call to work for the nation and the society inspired by the teachings of Swami Vivekanand.  In his press statement Sombhai, who runs a home for the old-aged and lives a simple life with his family in Ahmedabad, appealed to the people to see the marriage in the backdrop of these facts. Modi, who has ruled Gujarat since 2001, has left the field for \"spouse\" blank in four Assembly polls. Of late, he has also flaunted his single status at rallies, saying that he was single and had no one to be corrupt for.  Modi ended the speculation over his marital status after a long period of silence, perhaps because the Congress had run a smear campaign against him in the last Vidhan Sabha elections and even after that by projecting Jashodaben, a retired teacher living in a north Gujarat village along with her brother, as a spurned wife and a victim of Modi's exploitation. Modi's declaration of his marital status is aimed at pre-empting such a campaign and also any attempt to drag him to the Election Commission on the issue. Since 1992, when Gujarati weekly Abhiyan carried for the first time a story on Modi's marriage, Jashodaben and her family have refrained from talking to media, calling it a personal affair, and wishing Modi good luck in his endeavours.

Outgoing President Pranab Mukherjee was seated on the left side of the buggy and the new president on his right. On their way back, once Kovind has taken his oath, the two will exchange seats, leaving Mukherjee on the right and Kovind on the left. This buggy has interesting history at its tail. Here's where it comes from: WHERE DID THE BUGGY COME FROM? The gold-plated, horse-drawn buggy originally belonged to the Viceroy of India during the British era. How it remained in India after Independence is a story that will make many happy. After the partition, both India and Pakistan wanted the fancy buggy, and there was no longer a higher power to sort this quarrel.   So, what did they do to sort the dispute?  Simple. They did what cricket captains do these days. They tossed. Lt Col Thakur Govind Singh from India and Pakistan Army's Sahabzada Yaqub Khan let the responsibility of the buggy ownership rest on a coin. Guess who won the toss? Of course, India did. And here we are, after all these years, still using the old gal to flaunt around our newly-elected presidents. BUGGY'S USE After 1984, the buggy was not frequently used by any president for a few decades. While they did use it now and then, it was properly used again in 2014 by Pranab Mukherjee. Earlier, the gold-plated buggy was used by the president not only for ceremonial purposes, but also to move around in his 320-acre residential space.  Over the years, as the president's security grew tighter, the use of the buggy lessened, limited to ceremonial formalities at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.  However, with President Mukherjee's term, the buggy was brought back into action. Hopefully, President Kovind will continue this tradition.

The technologies detailed in the primary camera definition also apply to the secondary camera. The front facing camera is most commonly used for capturing self portraits/group shots for Social Media and video calling. Additionally, the front facing cameras work in conjunction with supplemental technology to provide face-detection for smart phone security. Android has had the ability to unlock your phone via rudimentary facial Recognition called Face Unlock since Version 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich was unveiled on October 19, 2011.  This has never been advertised as secure though. In Sept 2017, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 was the first Samsung phone to introduce iris scanning to provide a secure method of unlocking a phone.  In Sept '17, Apple announced the iPhone X that replaced Touch ID, Apple's fingerprint bio-metric security, with Face ID. FaceID is made even more robust as 'depth' can also be sensed by using the camera in conjunction with the new technology.  A byproduct of this is that Apple are one of the first manufactures to introduce 3D Avatars or Animoji capturing a users voice and expressions.

Some of the earliest examples include the weird 3D camera on the HTC EVO 3D. Then it was HTC again who introduced it in a different form on the One m8. Then LG decided to drop in with its cool wide-angle lens with the G5 and the same year, Apple decided to take in the other direction by adding a telephoto lens on the iPhone 7 Plus. Meanwhile, Huawei had other ideas, with its Leica branded monochrome camera on the P9. But just how many types of dual camera systems are out there and how do they differ from each other? Most importantly, are they any good or is it just a passing fad? Let\u2019s find out. We will start with this as this is the most basic form of dual camera system. In this system, the primary camera is accompanied by a second camera whose only function is to 3D map the area in front of the camera. As you may know, we are able to see in 3D because we have two eyes with slightly different perspectives that help us convey depth, especially for things that are close to us. The secondary camera in this system works similarly. With the second camera, the system can now tell roughly how far the objects in front of it are with respect to each other. This information is then used to separate the foreground subject from the background. The most common use of this technique is to create a shallow depth of field effect. While it\u2019s something that comes naturally to DSLR cameras with their big sensors and big lenses, the small smartphone cameras cannot achieve the same shallow depth of field. So instead, this technique is used to first figure out the borders of the foreground subject and then apply an iris blur effect on everything else. This gives the illusion of shallow depth of field. While sound in theory and occasionally in practice, this technique has its pitfalls. Unless your subject is a cardboard cutout, it will have depth to it and because this depth is not as much as the depth between the entire subject and the background, the camera occasionally ends up blurring the edges of the subject as well. Even when it does work reasonably well, it never quite looks natural, especially since most smartphone cameras that have this feature apply an even blur on everything in the background whereas with a DSLR, the intensity of the blur increases with the distance from the focus point. Camera systems with a dedicated depth sensor is one of the rarest types of dual camera systems. The first popular use of it was seen on the HTC One m8 but these days only the most basic smartphones, such as the Honor 6X or the Lenovo K8 Plus, can be seen using a dedicated depth sensor lens. A slightly more popular implementation of the secondary sensor is the monochrome camera. In this method, the primary camera is accompanied by a mostly identical secondary camera. Both cameras usually have identical sensors, apertures, lenses and focusing systems. The main and usually only difference between the two is that the second sensor lacks an RGB color filter. This means that the sensor cannot capture color information but on the upside, because there is one less thing blocking the sensor, the monochrome camera can capture more light. Every time you take a picture, the camera system combines the output of both cameras by layering them into one image. In theory, the two images combined will have greater detail and reduced noise. Alternately, you can also just shoot from the monochrome camera and get slightly better image quality at the cost of all the color information. One of the first examples of this system was the Huawei P9 and since then, few other devices have also shipped with it. To us, the advantages of this system are nebulous at best. While sound in theory, we can\u2019t really say for sure if the feature does really work as advertised. We have seen some good results with this system in the past but it's hard to tell if it was the dual camera doing all the work or it was just good image processing system. There is no real disadvantage to this system and we do appreciate that it\u2019s the only one of the systems discussed here that tries to do anything about the actual image quality instead of adding additional features but still, we would rather take some zooming ability over marginally improved image quality. Debuted first on the LG G5 early last year, the wide-angle camera is pretty much what it sounds like. To take G5\u2019s example, the phone had a 16 megapixel, 29mm equivalent f1.8 primary camera and 8 megapixel, 12mm equivalent f2.4 secondary camera. The 12mm focal length gave the secondary camera a crazy wide field of view that allowed the user to capture a much wider area without having to move back, or capture interesting perspectives afforded by such a wide-angle lens. We have mainly seen this on LG phones, with Motorola recently incorporating it in the X4, and we are fans of how it works. The wide-angle lens gives a very unique perspective that you simply don\u2019t get at all on smartphone cameras and apart from having practical value (capturing a large group of people from up close) also lets you capture some really cool looking shots. The early iterations of this system did have its disadvantages. On the G5 and V20, the ultra wide-angle lens image quality was nowhere near as good as the primary camera and also had significant barrel distortion that made it look like footage from a GoPro. However, LG has been steadily improving the system with every iteration and in its latest avatar on the V30, the secondary lens not only has highly respectable image quality but also significantly less lens distortion, making it far more useful. With good implementation, this system does have the potential to be a really cool second camera system for particular scenarios and we wish more manufacturers adopted it. The most common of all the dual camera systems today is the telephoto camera. In this, the primary camera is paired with a second camera that has a telephoto lens. As you can tell, this is the exact opposite of the wide-angle camera system, wherein it actually lets you zoom into your subject instead of zooming out. Since the iPhone 7 Plus, manufacturers have stuck to using a 2x factor for the second telephoto lens. This means the secondary lens has twice the focal length of the primary lens, giving you an instant 2x optical zoom. There are many advantages of this system. First is the most obvious, where you get 2x lossless optical zoom. Zooming on smartphones has largely been digital until now but with this you get to quickly move 2x closer to your subject with very little quality loss. Any further zooming is done digitally still but because the digital zoom is now being applied on top of 2x optical zoom, it gives much better results. Shooting with a telephoto lens also has other advantages. Telephoto lenses are more suitable for portraits than wide angle as they have less distortion and are more flattering to the subject. Most manufacturers go one step ahead and also implement the background blur effect that we saw with the very first system we talked about today (the primary lens now acts as the depth sensor). The combination of a telephoto lens and background blur gives far superior results than just applying background blur on wide-angle images. Of course, this system too has its disadvantages. So far none of the manufacturers have been able to get complete parity between the two cameras. When the iPhone 7 Plus launched last year, it had a much smaller aperture (f2.8) compared to the main camera (f1.8) and no OIS on the secondary sensor. The iPhone 8 Plus ships with similar arrangement (although the sensors are better this year) and even the iPhone X still has f2.4 for the second camera (although it does have OIS). The Note8 was the first phone with a telephoto camera to have OIS but even then it\u2019s still f2.4 (compared to f1.7 on the main lens) and the second sensor is slightly worse even if it has the same resolution. Due to this, there is generally a quality difference when shooting with the telephoto lens. It\u2019s even worse in lowlight, where due to the small aperture, most manufacturers just choose to disable the telephoto camera entirely, and instead when the user taps the 2x button, the camera just does a 2x digital zoom on the primary wide-angle lens. Needless to say, any further zooming is also digitally done on the primary lens. There are ways to force the camera to use the second lens on some phones but the results are generally not worth it. Still, most of these limitations seem to be temporary and something year after year advancements should take care of eventually. This is still by far the most practical solution of all the systems we discussed today. Not only does it give the user a much needed optical zoom ability but at a pinch also lets them take some decent looking shallow depth of field images. And that\u2019s pretty much it for the dual camera systems. Let us know in the comments which one do you prefer, and if you have any further queries or other topics you\u2019d like us to discuss in the future. Nice!!!!!!

Modi was the\u00a0chief minister of Gujarat\u00a0from 2001 to 2014 and is the\u00a0Member of Parliament\u00a0from\u00a0Varanasi. He is a member of the\u00a0Bharatiya Janata Party\u00a0(BJP) and of the\u00a0Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh\u00a0(RSS), a right-wing\u00a0Hindu nationalist\u00a0paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the first prime minister to have been born after India\u2019s\u00a0independence\u00a0in 1947 and the second prime minister not belonging to the\u00a0Indian National Congress\u00a0to have won two consecutive majorities in the\u00a0Lok Sabha, or lower house of Indian of parliament. He is also the longest serving prime minister from a non-congress party. Born and raised in\u00a0Vadnagar, a small town in northeastern\u00a0Gujarat, Modi completed his secondary education there. He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has drawn attention to having to work as a child in his father\u2019s tea stall on the Vadnagar railway station platform, a description that has not been reliably corroborated. At age 18, Modi was married to\u00a0Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He left his parental home where she had come to live. He first publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi has asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0declared by prime minister\u00a0Indira Gandhi\u00a0in 1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary. Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to\u00a0Keshubhai Patel\u2019s failing health and poor public image following the\u00a0earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the\u00a02002 Gujarat riots\u00a0in which 1044 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim, or otherwise criticised for its management of the crisis. A\u00a0Supreme Court of India-appointed Special Investigation Team found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally.\u00a0While his policies as chief minister\u2014credited with encouraging economic growth\u2014have received praise, his administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state. Modi led the BJP in the\u00a02014 general election\u00a0which gave the party a majority in the Indian\u00a0lower house\u00a0of parliament, the\u00a0Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since\u00a01984. Modi\u2019s administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy; he has centralised power by abolishing the\u00a0Planning Commission. He began a\u00a0high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a\u00a0demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes\u00a0and\u00a0transformation of taxation regime, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Under Modi\u2019s tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding. Following his party\u2019s victory in the\u00a02019 general election, his administration\u00a0revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir\u00a0and also introduced the\u00a0Citizenship Amendment Act, which resulted in\u00a0widespread protests\u00a0across the country. Described as engineering a political realignment towards\u00a0right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an\u00a0exclusionary social\u00a0agenda. Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a\u00a0Gujarati\u00a0Hindu\u00a0family of grocers in\u00a0Vadnagar,\u00a0Mehsana district,\u00a0Bombay State\u00a0(present-day\u00a0Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c.\u20091915\u20131989) and Hiraben Modi (born\u00a0c.\u20091920).\u00a0Modi\u2019s family belonged to the\u00a0Modh-Ghanchi-Teli\u00a0(oil-presser) community, which is categorised as an\u00a0Other Backward Class\u00a0by the Indian government. Modi had only infrequently spoken of his family background during his 13 years as chief minister of Gujarat. In the run up to the 2014 national elections, he began to regularly draw attention to his low-ranking social origins and to having to work as a child in his father\u2019s tea shop on the\u00a0Vadnagar railway station\u00a0platform, a description that the evidence of neighbours does not entirely corroborate. Modi completed his\u00a0higher secondary education\u00a0in Vadnagar in 1967, where teachers described him as an average student and a keen gifted debater, with interest in theatre. Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image. When eight years old, Modi was introduced to the\u00a0Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh\u00a0(RSS) and began attending its local\u00a0shakhas\u00a0(training sessions). There, Modi met\u00a0Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a\u00a0balswayamsevak\u00a0(junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor. While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda,\u00a0Bharatiya Jana Sangh\u00a0leaders who were founding members of the BJP\u2019s Gujarat unit in 1980. In a custom traditional to Narendra Modi\u2019s caste, his family arranged a\u00a0betrothal\u00a0to a girl,\u00a0Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when she was 17 and he was 18. Soon afterwards, he abandoned his bride,\u00a0and left home, never divorcing her, but the marriage remaining unmentioned in Modi\u2019s public pronouncements for many decades. In April 2014, shortly before the national elections that swept him to power, Modi publicly affirmed that he was married and his spouse was Jashodaben; the couple has remained married, but estranged. Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he went have emerged.\u00a0In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by\u00a0Swami Vivekananda: the\u00a0Belur Math\u00a0near\u00a0Kolkata, followed by the\u00a0Advaita Ashrama\u00a0in\u00a0Almora\u00a0and the\u00a0Ramakrishna Mission\u00a0in\u00a0Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education. Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi\u2019s life. In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the\u00a0Belur Math\u00a0but was turned away, after which Modi wandered through\u00a0Calcutta,\u00a0West Bengal\u00a0and\u00a0Assam, stopping in\u00a0Siliguri\u00a0and\u00a0Guwahati. Modi then went to the\u00a0Ramakrishna Ashram\u00a0in\u00a0Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to\u00a0Gujarat\u00a0via\u00a0Delhi\u00a0and\u00a0Rajasthan\u00a0in 1968\u201369. Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for\u00a0Ahmedabad. There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter\u2019s\u00a0canteen\u00a0at the\u00a0Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation. In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city. Modi\u2019s first known political activity as an adult was in 1971 when he, as per his remarks, joined a\u00a0Jana Sangh\u00a0Satyagraha in Delhi led by\u00a0Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u00a0to enlist for the battlefield during the\u00a0Bangladesh Liberation War. But the\u00a0Indira Gandhi-led central government disallowed open support for the\u00a0Mukti Bahini\u00a0and Modi, according to his own claim, was put in\u00a0Tihar Jail\u00a0for a short period.\u00a0After the\u00a0Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time\u00a0pracharak\u00a0(campaigner) for the\u00a0RSS, working under Inamdar.\u00a0Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested (as per his claim); this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him. Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001. Modi\u2019s claim that he was part of a Satyagraha led to a political war.\u00a0Applications were filed with the\u00a0PMO\u00a0under the\u00a0RTI Act\u00a0seeking details of his arrest. In reply, the PMO claimed that it maintains official records on Modi only since he took charge as the Prime Minister of India in 2014. Despite this claim, the official website of the PMO contains specific information about Modi which dates back to the 1950s. In 1978 Modi received a\u00a0Bachelor of Arts\u00a0degree in\u00a0political science\u00a0from the\u00a0School of Open Learning\u00a0(SOL)\u00a0at the\u00a0University of Delhi, graduating with a\u00a0third class. Five years later, in 1983, he received a\u00a0Master of Arts\u00a0degree in political science from\u00a0Gujarat University, graduating with a\u00a0first class as an external\u00a0distance learning\u00a0student. But there is a big controversy surrounding his educational qualification. Replying to an RTI query, the SOL said it did not have any data of students who received a BA degree in 1978. Jayantibhai Patel, a former political science professor of Gujarat University, claimed that the subjects listed in Modi\u2019s MA degree were not offered by the university when Modi was studying there. In June 1975, Prime Minister\u00a0Indira Gandhi\u00a0declared a\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0in India which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as \u201cThe Emergency\u201d, many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned. Modi was appointed general secretary of the \u201cGujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\u201d, an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned. Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations. Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists. During this period, Modi wrote a book in\u00a0Gujarati,\u00a0Sangharsh Ma Gujarat\u00a0(In The Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency. Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist\u00a0George Fernandes, as well as several other national political figures.\u00a0In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a\u00a0Sikh. Modi became an\u00a0RSS\u00a0sambhag pracharak\u00a0(regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of\u00a0Surat\u00a0and\u00a0Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS\u2019s version of the history of the Emergency. He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP\u2019s campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi\u2019s planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers. After\u00a0L. K. Advani\u00a0became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi\u2019s work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP\u2019s Gujarat unit later in 1987.  Modi rose within the party and was named a member of the BJP\u2019s National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise\u00a0L. K. Advani\u2019s 1990\u00a0Ram Rath Yatra\u00a0in 1990 and\u00a0Murli Manohar Joshi\u2019s 1991\u201392\u00a0Ekta Yatra\u00a0(Journey for Unity). However, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in Ahmedabad; friction with\u00a0Shankersinh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played a part in this decision. Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani, and as party secretary, Modi\u2019s electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly elections.\u00a0In November of that year Modi was appointed BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and\u00a0Himachal Pradesh. The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the\u00a0Indian National Congress\u00a0(Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections. Modi, on the selection committee for the\u00a01998 Assembly elections in Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP leader\u00a0Keshubhai Patel\u00a0over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as key to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections,and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year. In 2001, Keshubhai Patel\u2019s health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in\u00a0by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel\u2019s standing had been damaged by his administration\u2019s handling of the\u00a0earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel\u2019s administration, was chosen as a replacement.\u00a0Although\u00a0BJP\u00a0leader L. K. Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi\u2019s lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel\u2019s\u00a0deputy chief minister, telling Advani and\u00a0Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u00a0that he was \u201cgoing to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all\u201d. On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections.\u00a0Modi was sworn in as Chief Minister on 7 October 2001, and entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 by winning a by-election to the\u00a0Rajkot \u2013 II\u00a0constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC by 14,728 votes. Main article:\u00a02002 Gujarat riots On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers\u00a0burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people. The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from\u00a0Ayodhya\u00a0after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished\u00a0Babri Masjid.\u00a0In making a public statement after the incident, Modi declared it a terrorist attack planned and orchestrated by local Muslims.\u00a0The next day, the\u00a0Vishwa Hindu Parishad\u00a0called for a\u00a0bandh\u00a0across the state. Riots began during the\u00a0bandh, and\u00a0anti-Muslim violence\u00a0spread through Gujarat. The government\u2019s decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence. The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed.\u00a0Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000,\u00a0the vast majority Muslims\u00a0Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.\u00a0Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women. The government of Gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots, (with some blaming chief minister Modi explicitly) and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation.\u00a0Several scholars have described the violence as a\u00a0pogrom, while others have called it an example of\u00a0state terrorism.\u00a0Summarising academic views on the subject,\u00a0Martha Nussbaum\u00a0said: \u201cThere is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law.\u201dThe Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating.\u00a0The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the\u00a0bandh, despite such actions being illegal at the time.\u00a0State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there. Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.\u00a0During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able. Modi\u2019s personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, Modi said that \u201cWhat is happening is a chain of action and reaction.\u201d Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.\u00a0In March 2008, the\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots, including that of the\u00a0Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue. In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri (widow of\u00a0Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre), in April 2009 the court also asked the SIT to investigate the issue of Modi\u2019s complicity in the killings.The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.\u00a0In July 2011, the court-appointed\u00a0amicus curiae\u00a0Raju Ramachandran\u00a0submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT\u2019s position, he said that Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.The Supreme Court gave the matter to the magistrate\u2019s court. The SIT examined Ramachandran\u2019s report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jafri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013 the magistrate\u2019s court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT\u2019s finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister. Main article:\u00a02002 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election In the aftermath of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the\u00a0Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam\u00a0and the\u00a0Telugu Desam Party\u00a0(allies in the BJP-led\u00a0National Democratic Alliance\u00a0coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.\u00a0Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted. His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved.\u00a0Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002. In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.\u00a0Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign, and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters. He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 113,589 of 154,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes.\u00a0On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term. Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly. During Modi\u2019s second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from\u00a0Hindutva\u00a0to Gujarat\u2019s economic development.\u00a0Modi curtailed the influence of\u00a0Sangh Parivar\u00a0organisations such as the\u00a0Bharatiya Kisan Sangh\u00a0(BKS) and the\u00a0Vishva Hindu Parishad\u00a0(VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad\u2019s textile industry,\u00a0and dropped\u00a0Gordhan Zadafia\u00a0(an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief\u00a0Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers\u2019 demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in\u00a0Gandhinagar\u00a0deepened the rift with the\u00a0Vishva Hindu Parishad.\u00a0Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi\u2019s administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a foreword to a textbook by\u00a0Dinanath Batra\u00a0released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including\u00a0test-tube babies. Modi\u2019s relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister\u00a0Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u00a0(who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister)\u00a0distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the\u00a02004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP\u2019s electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots. Questions about Modi\u2019s relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the\u00a0State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the\u00a0Commission on International Religious Freedom\u00a0formed under the aegis of the\u00a0International Religious Freedom Act,\u00a0the only person\u00a0denied a US visa\u00a0under this law. The UK and the\u00a0European Union\u00a0refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK\u00a0and the EU\u00a0lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election he was invited to Washington as the nation\u2019s prime minister. During the run-up to the\u00a02007 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election\u00a0and the\u00a02009 Indian general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism. In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister\u00a0Manmohan Singh\u00a0\u201d\u00a0for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\u201d such as the 2002\u00a0Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the\u00a02006 Mumbai train bombings.\u00a0In 2007 Modi authored\u00a0Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a \u201cspiritual experience\u201d for Valmiks, a sub-caste of\u00a0Dalits. However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct. After the November\u00a02008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat\u2019s 1,600-kilometre (990\u00a0mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats. In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post,\u00a0and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year\u2019s election. As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and\u00a0small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007\u00a0Vibrant Gujarat\u00a0summit, real-estate investment deals worth\u00a0\u20b96.6 trillion\u00a0(equivalent to\u00a0\u20b917\u00a0trillion or US$220\u00a0billion in 2020) were signed. The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were\u00a0check dams, which helped recharge the\u00a0aquifers\u00a0beneath them.\u00a0Sixty of the 112\u00a0tehsils\u00a0which had depleted the\u00a0water table\u00a0in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010. As a result, the state\u2019s production of\u00a0genetically modified cotton\u00a0increased to become the largest in India. The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarat\u2019s agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the\u00a0Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4\u20136% of the area intended.\u00a0Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural\u00a0growth rate\u00a0of 10.97 percent \u2013 the highest of any state.\u00a0However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992\u201397 INC government was 12.9 percent. In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to\u00a0Tata Motors\u00a0to set up a plant manufacturing the\u00a0Nano\u00a0after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata to Gujarat. The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed. Modi significantly changed the state\u2019s system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the\u00a0Jyotigram Yojana\u00a0scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised,\u00a0according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers. A contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat\u2019s economic development during Modi\u2019s tenure as chief minister.\u00a0The state\u2019s GDP growth rate averaged 10% during Modi\u2019s tenure, a value similar to other highly industrialised states, and above that of the country as a whole. Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office, and some scholars have stated that growth did not much accelerate during Modi\u2019s tenure,\u00a0although the state is considered to have maintained a high growth rate during Modi\u2019s Chief Ministership. Under Narendra Modi, Gujarat topped the\u00a0World Bank\u2019s \u201cease of doing business\u201d rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years. In 2013, Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens\u2019 rights and labour and business regulation among the country\u2019s 20 largest states. In the later years of Modi\u2019s government, Gujarat\u2019s economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.\u00a0Tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states, as was land. Modi\u2019s policies to make Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of\u00a0Special Economic Zones, where labour laws were greatly weakened. Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi\u2019s tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the \u201calarming\u201d category on the\u00a0India State Hunger Index. A study by\u00a0UNICEF\u00a0and the Indian government found that Gujarat under Modi had a poor record with respect to\u00a0immunisation\u00a0in children. Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.\u00a0It showed a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined. With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below many Indian states. The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims,\u00a0Dalits, and\u00a0Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities.\u00a0Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the\u00a0Human Development Index. Under Modi, the state government spent less than the national average on education and healthcare. Further information:\u00a02012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election Despite the BJP\u2019s shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi\u2019s election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders. \u00a0He did, however, maintain relations with\u00a0Dawoodi Bohra. His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the\u00a0killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012.\u00a0During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.  While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people,something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of\u00a0Sanjiv Bhatt. The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure \u00a0and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995). After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from\u00a0Maninagar\u00a0on 21 May 2014.\u00a0Anandiben Patel\u00a0succeeded him as the chief minister. Main article:\u00a0Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2014 Indian general election In September 2013 Modi was named the BJP\u2019s candidate for prime minister ahead of the\u00a02014 Lok Sabha election. \u00a0Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modi\u2019s candidature,\u00a0including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were \u201cconcerned with their personal agendas\u201d.\u00a0Modi played a dominant role in the BJP\u2019s election campaign. Several people who voted for the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party.\u00a0The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.\u00a0The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.Modi meets his mother after winning the\u00a02014 elections. During the campaign, Modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous INC government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat.\u00a0Modi projected himself as a person who could bring about \u201cdevelopment,\u201d without focus on any specific policies. His message found support among young Indians and among middle-class citizens. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi\u2019s commitment to\u00a0secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism.\u00a0Prior to the election Modi\u2019s image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, but during the campaign the BJP was able to shift this to a focus on Modi\u2019s\u00a0neoliberal\u00a0ideology and the Gujarat model of development,\u00a0although Hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign.The BJP\u2019s campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media. Modi\u2019s campaign blitz cost around\u00a0\u20b950 billion\u00a0(US$660\u00a0million) and the BJP received extensive financial support from corporate donors. In addition to more conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media,\u00a0and addressed more than 1000 rallies via\u00a0hologram\u00a0appearances. The BJP won 31% of the vote,\u00a0and more than doubled its tally in the\u00a0Lok Sabha\u00a0to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since\u00a01984.\u00a0Voter dissatisfaction with the INC, as well as with regional parties in North India, was another reason for the success of the BJP, as was the support from the RSS. In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before. It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims. The magnitude of the BJP\u2019s victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from\u00a0progressive parties\u00a0and towards the right-wing. Modi\u2019s tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism. Modi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies:\u00a0Varanasi\u00a0and\u00a0Vadodara. He won in both constituencies, defeating\u00a0Aam Aadmi Party\u00a0leader\u00a0Arvind Kejriwal\u00a0in Varanasi by 371,784 votes and\u00a0Madhusudan Mistry\u00a0of the INC in Vadodara by 570,128 votes. Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, was appointed prime minister by India\u2019s president. To comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat. Main article:\u00a0Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2019 Indian general election On 13 October 2018, Modi was renamed as the BJP candidate for prime minister for the\u00a02019 general election. The chief campaigner for the party was BJP\u2019s president\u00a0Amit Shah. Modi launched the\u00a0Main Bhi Chowkidar\u00a0campaign ahead of the general election, against\u00a0Chowkidar Chor Hai\u00a0campaign slogan of\u00a0INC.\u00a0In the year 2018, end\u00a0Party\u2019s, second-biggest alliance\u00a0Telugu Desam Party\u00a0split from\u00a0NDA\u00a0over the matter of special-status for\u00a0Andhra Pradesh. The campaign was started by\u00a0Amit Shah\u00a0on 8 April 2019. In the campaign, Modi was targeted by the opposition on corruption allegations over\u00a0Rafale deal\u00a0with\u00a0France government. Highlighting this\u00a0controversy\u00a0the campaign \u201cChowkidar Chor Hai\u201d was started, which was contrary to \u201cMain Bhi Chowkidar\u201d slogan. Modi made defence and national security among the foremost topics for the\u00a0election campaign, especially after\u00a0Pulwama attack, and the retaliatory attack of\u00a0Balakot airstrike\u00a0was counted as an achievement of the\u00a0Modi administration. Other topics in the campaign were development and\u00a0good foreign relations\u00a0in the first premiership. Modi contested the Lok Sabha elections as a candidate from\u00a0Varanasi. He won the seat by defeating Shalini Yadav of the\u00a0Samajwadi Party, who fought on\u00a0SP-BSP\u00a0alliance by a margin of 479,505 votes.\u00a0Modi was unanimously appointed the prime minister for a second time by the\u00a0National Democratic Alliance, after the alliance won the election for the second time by securing 353 seats in the\u00a0Lok Sabha\u00a0with the\u00a0BJP\u00a0alone won 303 seats. Main article:\u00a0Premiership of Narendra Modi After the\u00a0Bharatiya Janata Party\u00a0led\u00a0National Democratic Alliance\u00a0won a landslide in the\u00a02014 Lok Sabha election, Narendra Modi was\u00a0sworn in as the Prime Minister of India\u00a0on 26 May 2014. He became the first Prime Minister born after India\u2019s\u00a0independence\u00a0from the\u00a0British Empire\u00a0in 1947. Modi started his second term after the\u00a0Bharatiya Janata Party\u00a0led\u00a0National Democratic Alliance\u00a0won again in the\u00a02019 Lok Sabha election. On 6 December 2020, Modi became the 4th longest serving Prime Minister of India and the longest serving Non-Congress\u00a0Prime Minister. Modi\u2019s first year as prime minister saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations. His efforts at centralisation have been linked to an increase in the number of senior administration officials resigning their positions.\u00a0Initially lacking a majority in the\u00a0Rajya Sabha, or upper house of Indian Parliament, Modi passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the\u00a0judiciary. In December 2014 Modi abolished the\u00a0Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India, or\u00a0NITI Aayog. The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister.\u00a0The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice. The Modi government launched investigations by the\u00a0Intelligence Bureau\u00a0against numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations in the first year of the administration. The investigations, on the grounds that these organisations were slowing economic growth, was criticised as a\u00a0witch-hunt. International\u00a0humanitarian aid\u00a0organisation\u00a0Medecins Sans Frontieres\u00a0was among the groups that were put under pressure. Other organisations affected included the\u00a0Sierra Club\u00a0and\u00a0Avaaz. Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi\u2019s style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi. Modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; a total of 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous governments over a span of 64 years. He started a monthly radio programme titled \u201cMann Ki Baat\u201d on 3 October 2014.\u00a0Modi also launched the\u00a0Digital India\u00a0programme, with the goal of ensuring that government services are available electronically, building infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boosting manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promoting\u00a0digital literacy. Modi launched\u00a0Ujjwala scheme\u00a0to provide free LPG connection to rural households. The scheme led to an increase in LPG consumption by 56% in 2019 as compared to 2014.\u00a0In 2019, a law was passed to provide 10% reservation to Economically weaker sections. He was again\u00a0sworn in as prime minister\u00a0on 30 May 2019. On 30 July 2019,\u00a0Parliament of India\u00a0declared the practice of\u00a0Triple Talaq\u00a0as illegal, unconstitutional and made it punishable act from 1 August 2019 which is deemed to be in effect from 19 September 2018. On 5 August 2019, the government moved resolution to scrap Article 370 in the Rajya Sabha, and also reorganise the state with\u00a0Jammu and Kashmir\u00a0serving as one of the union territory and\u00a0Ladakh\u00a0region separated out as a separate union territory. Modi launched the \u2018Operation Ganga\u2019 initiative officially by the government of India to bring back Indians stranded in Ukraine, during the\u00a02022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Under this, India successfully brought back more than a 19,000 of its nationals from the country. This also involved assistance to those who have crossed over to the neighboring countries of Romania, Hungary, Poland, Moldova, Slovakia. Prime Minister Modi sent 4 special envoys headed by the union ministers\u00a0Hardeep Singh Puri,\u00a0Jyotiraditya Scindia,\u00a0Kiren Rijiju\u00a0and\u00a0V. K. Singh\u00a0to the neighboring nations of Ukraine to assist coordination efforts.The\u00a0Indian Air Force\u00a0was also brought into the operation on 1 March 2022.  The economic policies of Modi\u2019s government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, based on a\u00a0neoliberal\u00a0framework.\u00a0Modi liberalised India\u2019s\u00a0foreign direct investment\u00a0policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other proposed reforms included making it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them; some of these proposals were dropped after protests. The reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country\u2019s largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. The\u00a0Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers. The funds dedicated to poverty reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly decreased by the Modi administration.\u00a0The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6% of GDP during the Congress government to 12.6% during Modi\u2019s first year in office.Spending on health and family welfare declined by 15%, and on primary and secondary education by 16%. The budgetary allocation for the\u00a0Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, or the \u201ceducation for all\u201d programme, declined by 22%. The government also lowered corporate taxes, abolished the\u00a0wealth tax, increased sales taxes, and reduced customs duties on gold, and jewellery.\u00a0In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices. In September 2014, Modi introduced the\u00a0Make in India\u00a0initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub.\u00a0Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. Modi\u2019s administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. Modi\u2019s government put in place the\u00a0Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017. In his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate\u00a0black money. On 9 November 2016, the government\u00a0demonetised \u20b9500 and \u20b91000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism.\u00a0The move led to severe cash shortages,\u00a0a steep decline in the Indian stock indices\u00a0BSE SENSEX\u00a0and\u00a0NIFTY 50, and sparked widespread protests throughout the country. Several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash. \u00a0In the subsequent year, the number of income tax returns filed for individuals rose by 25%, and the number of digital transactions increased steeply. Over the first four years of\u00a0Modi\u2019s premiership, India\u2019s GDP grew at an average rate of 7.23%, higher than the rate of 6.39% under the previous government.\u00a0The level of income inequality increased, while an internal government report said that in 2017, unemployment had increased to its highest level in 45 years. The loss of jobs was attributed to the\u00a02016 demonetisation, and to the effects of the\u00a0Goods and Services Tax. In the next year, after 2018,\u00a0Indian economy\u00a0started a gradual recovery with a\u00a0GDP\u00a0growth of 6.12% in 2018\u201319\u00a0FY, with an inflation rate of 3.4%. Same year, India was successful in making a good economy in trade and manufacturing sector. While in the\u00a0FY\u00a0of 2019\u201320, due to the\u00a0general election, Modi government focused more on their\u00a0election campaign. In the year 2019\u201320, the\u00a0GDP\u00a0growth rate was 4.18% and inflation rate also increased to 4.7% from 3.4% in the previous year. Though being high unemployment, increase in inflation rate and budget deficiency, Modi\u2019s leadership won in\u00a02019 elections. Due to the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic, numerous\u00a0rating agencies\u00a0downgraded India\u2019s GDP predictions for FY21 to negative figures, signalling a recession in India, the most severe since 1979. \u00a0According to a\u00a0Dun & Bradstreet\u00a0report, the country is likely to suffer a recession in the third quarter of FY2020 as a result of the over 2-month long\u00a0nation-wide lockdown\u00a0imposed to curb the spread of\u00a0COVID-19. This was also accompanied by the\u00a0mass migration of migrant workers. See also:\u00a0Swachh Bharat Mission In his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the amount of money spent by the central government on healthcare. The Modi government launched New Health Policy (NHP) in January 2015. The policy did not increase the government\u2019s spending on healthcare, instead emphasising the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including reducing child and maternal mortality rates. The\u00a0National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices received nearly 20% less funds in 2015 than in the previous year. 15 national health programmes, including those aimed at controlling tobacco use and supporting healthcare for the elderly, were merged with the National Health Mission. In its budget for the second year after it took office, the Modi government reduced healthcare spending by 15%. The healthcare budget for the following year rose by 19%. The budget was viewed positively by private insurance providers. Public health experts criticised its emphasis on the role of private healthcare providers, and suggested that it represented a shift away from public health facilities. The healthcare budget rose by 11.5% in 2018; the change included an allocation of\u00a0\u20b920 billion\u00a0(US$260\u00a0million) for a government-funded health insurance program, and a decrease in the budget of the National Health Mission. The government introduced stricter packaging laws for tobacco which requires 85% of the packet size to be covered by pictorial warnings.\u00a0An article in the medical journal\u00a0Lancet\u00a0stated that the country \u201cmight have taken a few steps back in public health\u201d under Modi. In 2018 Modi launched the\u00a0Ayushman Bharat Yojana, a government health insurance scheme intended to insure 500\u00a0million people. 100,000 people had signed up by October 2018. Modi emphasised his government\u2019s efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health. On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the\u00a0Swachh Bharat Mission\u00a0(\u201cClean India\u201d) campaign. The stated goals of the campaign included eliminating\u00a0open defecation\u00a0and\u00a0manual scavenging\u00a0within five years. As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them.The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants.\u00a0The administration plans to construct 60\u00a0million toilets by 2019. The construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the toilets constructed for them.\u00a0Sanitation cover in the country increased from 38.7% in October 2014 to 84.1% in May 2018; however, usage of the new sanitary facilities lagged behind the government\u2019s targets.\u00a0In 2018, the\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0stated that at least 180,000 diarrhoeal deaths were averted in rural India after the launch of the sanitation effort. During the 2014 election campaign, the BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders known to have opposed\u00a0Hindu nationalism, including\u00a0B. R. Ambedkar,\u00a0Subhas Chandra Bose, and\u00a0Ram Manohar Lohia. The campaign also saw the use of rhetoric based on Hindutva by BJP leaders in certain states. Communal tensions were played upon especially in Uttar Pradesh and the states of Northeast India. \u00a0A proposal for the controversial\u00a0Uniform Civil Code\u00a0was a part of the BJP\u2019s election manifesto. The activities of a number of Hindu nationalist organisations increased in scope after Modi\u2019s election as Prime Minister, sometimes with the support of the government. These activities included a Hindu\u00a0religious conversion\u00a0programme, a campaign against the alleged Islamic practice of \u201cLove Jihad\u201d, and attempts to celebrate\u00a0Nathuram Godse, the assassin of\u00a0Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right wing\u00a0Hindu Mahasabha. Officials in the government, including the Home Minister, defended the conversion programmes.  Links between the\u00a0BJP\u00a0and the RSS grew stronger under Modi. The RSS provided organisational support to the BJP\u2019s electoral campaigns, while the Modi administration appointed a number of individuals affiliated with the RSS to prominent government positions. In 2014,\u00a0Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, became the chairperson of the\u00a0Indian Council of Historical Research\u00a0(ICHR). Historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the BJP, questioned his credentials as a historian, and stated that the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism. The\u00a0North East Delhi riots, which left more than 40 dead and hundreds injured, were triggered by protests against a\u00a0citizenship law\u00a0seen by many critics as\u00a0anti-Muslim\u00a0and part of Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist agenda. On 5 August 2020, Modi visited\u00a0Ayodhya\u00a0after the\u00a0Supreme Court in 2019\u00a0ordered a\u00a0contested land in Ayodhya\u00a0to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple and ordered the government to give alternate 5 acre land to Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque. He became the first prime minister to visit\u00a0Ram Janmabhoomi\u00a0and\u00a0Hanuman Garhi. Foreign policy played a relatively small role in Modi\u2019s election campaign, and did not feature prominently in the BJP\u2019s election manifesto. Modi invited all the other leaders of\u00a0SAARC\u00a0countries to his swearing in ceremony as prime minister. He was the first Indian prime minister to do so. Modi\u2019s foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding INC government, focused on improving economic ties, security, and regional relations. Modi continued Manmohan Singh\u2019s policy of \u201cmulti-alignment.\u201d The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially in East Asia, with the use of slogans such as \u201cMake in India\u201d and \u201cDigital India\u201d. The government also tried to improve relations with\u00a0Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as\u00a0Bahrain,\u00a0Iran,\u00a0Saudi Arabia, and the\u00a0United Arab Emirates, as well as with\u00a0Israel.  The\u00a0foreign relations of India\u00a0with the USA also mended after Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister. During the run-up to the general election there was wide-ranging scepticism regarding future of the\u00a0strategic bilateral relation\u00a0under Modi\u2019s premiership as in 2005 he was, while\u00a0Chief Minister of Gujarat, denied a U.S. visa during the\u00a0Bush administration\u00a0for his\u00a0poor\u00a0human rights records. However sensing Modi\u2019s inevitable victory well before the election, the\u00a0US Ambassador\u00a0Nancy Powell\u00a0had reached out to him as part of greater\u00a0rapprochement\u00a0from the west. Moreover, following his 2014 election as the Prime Minister of India\u00a0President Obama\u00a0congratulated him over the telephone and invited him to visit the US. \u00a0Modi government has been successful in making good foreign relations with the\u00a0USA\u00a0in the presidency of both\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0and\u00a0Donald Trump. During the first few months after the election, Modi made trips to a number of different countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the\u00a0BRICS,\u00a0ASEAN, and\u00a0G20\u00a0summits. One of Modi\u2019s first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid. \u00a0Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country. \u00a0While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, the visits were expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries. In 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land exchange deal with Bangladesh about the\u00a0India\u2013Bangladesh enclaves, which had been initiated by the government of Manmohan Singh. Modi\u2019s administration gave renewed attention to India\u2019s \u201cLook East Policy\u201d, instituted in 1991. The policy was renamed the \u201cAct East Policy\u201d, and involved directing Indian foreign policy towards\u00a0East Asia\u00a0and\u00a0Southeast Asia. The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with\u00a0Myanmar, through the state of\u00a0Manipur. This represented a break with India\u2019s historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade. China\u2013India relations\u00a0have deteriorated rapidly following the\u00a02020 China\u2013India skirmishes. Modi has pledged aid of $900 million to Afghanistan, visited the nation twice and been honoured with the nation\u2019s highest civilian honour in 2016. India\u2019s nominal military spending increased steadily under Modi. The military budget declined over Modi\u2019s tenure both as a fraction of GDP and when adjusted for inflation.\u00a0A substantial portion of the military budget was devoted to personnel costs, leading commentators to write that the budget was constraining Indian military modernisation. The BJP election manifesto had also promised to deal with illegal immigration into India in the Northeast, as well as to be more firm in its handling of insurgent groups. The Modi government issued a notification allowing Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to legalise their residency in India. The government described the measure as being taken for humanitarian reasons but it drew criticism from several Assamese organisations. The Modi administration negotiated a peace agreement with the largest faction of the\u00a0National Socialist Council of Nagaland\u00a0(NSCM), which was announced in August 2015. The\u00a0Naga\u00a0insurgency in northeast India had begun in the 1950s. The NSCM and the government had agreed to a ceasefire in 1997, but a peace accord had not previously been signed. In 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the Khaplang faction of the NSCM (NSCM-K). The NSCM-K responded with a series of attacks, which killed 18 people.\u00a0The Modi government carried out a raid across the border with Myanmar as a result, and labelled the NSCM-K a terrorist organisation. Modi promised to be \u201ctough on Pakistan\u201d during his election campaign, and repeatedly stated that Pakistan was an\u00a0exporter of terrorism. On 29 September 2016, the Indian Army stated that it had conducted a\u00a0surgical strike\u00a0on terror\u00a0launch pads\u00a0in\u00a0Azad Kashmir. The Indian media claimed that up to 50 terrorists and Pakistani soldiers had been killed in the strike.Pakistan initially denied that any strikes had taken place. Subsequent reports suggested that Indian claim about the scope of the strike and the number of casualties had been exaggerated, although cross-border strikes had been carried out. In February 2019 India carried out\u00a0airstrikes\u00a0in Pakistan against a supposed terrorist camp.\u00a0Further military skirmishes\u00a0followed, including cross-border shelling and the loss of an Indian aircraft. Following his victory in\u00a02019 Lok Sabha elections, he focused more on Defence policies of India, especially against China and Pakistan. On 5 May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops engaged in aggressive\u00a0melee, face-offs and\u00a0skirmishes\u00a0at locations along the\u00a0Sino-Indian border, including near the disputed\u00a0Pangong Lake\u00a0in\u00a0Ladakh\u00a0and the\u00a0Tibet Autonomous Region, and near the border between\u00a0Sikkim\u00a0and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Additional clashes also took place at locations in eastern Ladakh along the\u00a0Line of Actual Control\u00a0(LAC). After which there was start of\u00a0skirmishes\u00a0between the nations leading to many border clashes, responses and reactions from both sides. A series of talks were also held between the two by both military and diplomatic means for peace. The first border clash reported in 2021 was on 20 January, referred to as a minor border clash in\u00a0Sikkim. Modi signed an agreement with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in December 2021 to extend military technical cooperation. The Modi government struck a deal with Russia, buying the\u00a0S-400 missile system, an anti-missile striking system thereby constructing much stronger ties and relationship between the two nations. During the\u00a02022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, India refused to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion and stayed neutral, without opting to back both the countries . In naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the \u201cMinistry of Environment and Forests\u201d the \u201cMinistry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change.\u201d In the first budget of the government, the money allotted to this ministry was reduced by more than 50%.\u00a0The new ministry also removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection. These included no longer requiring clearance from the\u00a0National Board for Wildlife\u00a0for projects close to protected areas, and allowing certain projects to proceed before environmental clearance was received.\u00a0The government also tried to reconstitute the Wildlife board such that it no longer had representatives from non-governmental organisations: however, this move was prevented by the\u00a0Supreme Court. Modi also relaxed or abolished a number of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries.bThe changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by\u00a0environmentalists. Under the UPA government that preceded Modi\u2019s administration, field trials of\u00a0Genetically Modified (GM) crops\u00a0had essentially been put on hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods. Under the Modi government these restrictions were gradually lifted. The government received some criticism for freezing the bank accounts of environmental group\u00a0Greenpeace, citing financial irregularities, although a leaked government report said that the freeze had to do with Greenpeace\u2019s opposition to GM crops.\u00a0At the\u00a0COP26\u00a0conference Modi announced that India would target\u00a0carbon neutrality\u00a0by 2070, and also expand its renewable energy capacity. Though the date of net zero is far behind that of China and the USA and India\u2019s government wants to continue with the use of coal, Indian environmentalists and economists applauded the decision, describing it as a bold climate action.  Under Modi\u2019s tenure, India has experienced\u00a0democratic backsliding.According to one study, \u201cThe BJP government incrementally but systemically attacked nearly all existing mechanisms that are in place to hold the political executive to account, either by ensuring that these mechanisms became subservient to the political executive or were captured by party loyalists.\u201d Scholars also point to how the Modi government has used state power to intimidate and stifle critics in the media and academia, thus undermining freedom of expression and alternative sources of information. There have been several reports of the\u00a0Modi government\u00a0to be as an\u00a0authoritarian conservative\u00a0government, even due to lack of good\u00a0opposition. In accordance with Ghanchi tradition, Modi\u2019s marriage was arranged by his parents when he was a child. He was engaged at age 13 to\u00a0Jashodaben Modi, marrying her when he was 18. They spent little time together and grew apart when Modi began two years of travel, including visits to Hindu\u00a0ashrams.\u00a0Reportedly, their marriage was never\u00a0consummated, and he kept it a secret because otherwise he could not have become a \u2018pracharak\u2019 in the puritan\u00a0Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. \u00a0Modi kept his marriage secret for most of his career. He acknowledged his wife for the first time when he filed his nomination for the 2014 general elections. Modi maintains a close relationship with his\u00a0centenarian\u00a0mother, Hiraben. A\u00a0vegetarian\u00a0and teetotaler, Modi has a frugal lifestyle and is a\u00a0workaholic\u00a0and introvert. A person named Badri Meena has been his cook since 2002. Modi\u2019s 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with citizens on a live chat. Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved\u00a0kurta, as well as for a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President\u00a0Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. \u00a0Modi\u2019s personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic. He had published a Gujarati book titled\u00a0Jyotipunj\u00a0in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of\u00a0M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as\u00a0Pujniya Shri Guruji\u00a0(\u201cGuru worthy of worship\u201d).\u00a0According to\u00a0The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children. The nomination of Modi for the prime ministership drew attention to his reputation as \u201cone of contemporary India\u2019s most controversial and divisive politicians.\u201d During the 2014 election campaign the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader, who would be able to take difficult decisions.\u00a0Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, in a manner unusual for the BJP and RSS.\u00a0Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and \u201cdevelopment\u201d.\u00a0Nonetheless, his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy.Modi\u2019s hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.\u00a0In March 2021, Modi received his fir COVID-19 vaccine dose at the\u00a0All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Modi has made donations for various causes and programmes. One such instance was when Modi donated\u00a0\u20b9225,000\u00a0(US$3,000) towards the initial corpus of the\u00a0Prime Minister\u2019s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM-CARES)\u00a0Fund.\u00a0In his role as\u00a0chief minister of Gujarat, Modi had donated\u00a0\u20b92.1 million\u00a0(US$28,000) from personal savings for educating daughters of state government officials. Modi had also raised\u00a0\u20b9899.6 million\u00a0(US$12\u00a0million) by auctioning all the gifts he received as chief minister and donated this to the Kanya Kelavani Fund. The money was spent on the\u00a0education of girl children, through the scheme. Modi interacting with the school children after delivering his address on\u00a0Independence Day\u00a0in New Delhi, 15 August 2017. As a Prime Minister, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings; at the end of his first year in office, he received an overall approval rating of 87% in a Pew Research poll, with 68% of people rating him \u201cvery favorably\u201d and 93% approving of his government. His approval rating remained largely consistent at around 74% through his second year in office, according to a nationwide poll conducted by instaVaani. At the end of his second year in office, an updated Pew Research poll showed Modi continued to receive high overall approval ratings of 81%, with 57% of those polled rating him \u201cvery favorably.\u201d\u00a0At the end of his third year in office, a further Pew Research poll showed Modi with an overall approval rating of 88%, his highest yet, with 69% of people polled rating him \u201cvery favorably.\u201d\u00a0A poll conducted y\u00a0The Times of India\u00a0in May 2017 showed 77% of the respondents rated Modi as \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d.\u00a0In early 2017, a survey from\u00a0Pew Research Center\u00a0showed Modi to be the most popular figure in Indian politics.\u00a0In a weekly analysis by\u00a0Morning Consult\u00a0called the Global Leader Approval Rating Tracker, Modi had the highest net approval rating as of 22 December 2020 of all government leaders in the 13 countries being tracked. In March 2012 and June 2014, Modi appeared on the cover of the Asian edition of\u00a0Time Magazine, one of the few Indian politicians to have done so. He was awarded\u00a0Indian of the Year\u00a0by\u00a0CNN-News18\u00a0(formally\u00a0CNN-IBN) news network in 2014. In June 2015, Modi was featured on the\u00a0cover of Time Magazine \u00a0In 2014, 2015, 2017, 2020 and 2021, he was named one of Time magazine\u2019s\u00a0100 Most Influential People in the World. Forbes Magazine\u00a0ranked him the 15th Most Powerful Person in the World in 2014 and the\u00a09th Most Powerful Person in the World\u00a0in 2015, 2016 and 2018. \u00a0In 2015, Modi was ranked the\u00a013th Most Influential Person in the World\u00a0by\u00a0Bloomberg Markets\u00a0Magazine. Modi was ranked fifth on\u00a0Fortune Magazine\u2018s first annual list of the \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Leaders\u201d in 2015. In 2017,\u00a0Gallup International Association\u00a0(GIA) conducted a poll and ranked Modi as third top leader of the world. In 2016, a wax statue of Modi was unveiled at\u00a0Madame Tussauds\u00a0wax museum\u00a0in London. In 2015 he was named one of\u00a0Time\u2018s \u201c30 Most Influential People on the Internet\u201d as the\u00a0second-most-followed politician\u00a0on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook.\u00a0In 2018, he was the third most followed\u00a0world leader\u00a0on Twitter, and the most followed world leader on Facebook and\u00a0Instagram. \u00a0In October 2018, Modi received United Nations\u2019s highest environmental award, the \u2018Champions of the Earth\u2019, for policy leadership by \u201cpioneering work in championing\u201d the\u00a0International Solar Alliance\u00a0and \u201cnew areas of levels of cooperation on environmental action\u201d.\u00a0He was conferred the 2018\u00a0Seoul Peace Prize\u00a0in recognition of \u201chis dedication to improving international co-operation, raising global economic growth, accelerating the Human Development of the people of India by fostering economic growth and furthering the development of democracy through anti-corruption and social integration efforts\u201d. He is the first Indian to win the award. Following his\u00a0second swearing-in ceremony\u00a0as Prime Minister of India, a picture of Modi was displayed on the facade of the\u00a0ADNOC\u00a0building in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The Texas India Forum hosted a community event in honour of Modi on 22 September 2019 at the\u00a0NRG Stadium\u00a0in\u00a0Houston,\u00a0Texas. The event was attended by over 50,000 people and several American politicians including President\u00a0Donald Trump, making it the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the United States other than the\u00a0Pope. At the same event, Modi was presented with the\u00a0Key to the City\u00a0of Houston by Mayor\u00a0Sylvester Turner. He was awarded the\u00a0Global Goalkeeper Award\u00a0on 24 September 2019 in New York City by the\u00a0Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u00a0in recognition for the\u00a0Swachh Bharat Mission\u00a0and \u201cthe progress India has made in providing safe sanitation under his leadership\u201d. In 2020, Modi was among eight world leaders awarded the parodic\u00a0Ig Nobel Prize\u00a0in Medical Education \u201cfor using the\u00a0COVID-19 viral pandemic\u00a0to teach the world that politicians can have a more immediate effect on life and death than scientists and doctors can\u201d. On 21 December 2020, President Donald Trump awarded Modi with the\u00a0Legion of Merit\u00a0for elevating the\u00a0India\u2013United States relations. The Legion of Merit was awarded to Modi along with Prime Minister of Australia\u00a0Scott Morrison\u00a0and former Prime Minister of Japan\u00a0Shinzo Abe, the \u201coriginal architects\u201d of the\u00a0QUAD Modi is featured in TIME Magazine\u2019s 100 most influential people of 2021 list, making it his fifth time after 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2020.\u00a0TIME\u00a0called him the third \u201cpivotal leader\u201d of independent India after\u00a0Jawaharlal Nehru\u00a0and\u00a0Indira Gandhi\u00a0who \u201cdominated the country\u2019s politics like no one since them\u201d.

The Ultra-stable Structures Laboratory at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center will assist engineering and design of next-generation, large, ultra-stable telescopes to detect and characterize Earth-like planets around distant stars.\u00a0 (Image credit: NASA GSFC) \u201cAre we alone in the universe?\u201d may be one of the most compelling questions of our generation. Direct imaging of planetary systems around other stars to detect and characterize Earth-like planets that could potentially sustain life requires telescopes that are large and extremely stable. NASA has developed a series of telescopes to detect and characterize Earth-like planets, including the retired Kepler mission, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the new James Webb Space Telescope (Webb). The agency is now beginning to explore development of much more sensitive telescopes at different wavelengths to investigate habitable worlds, among other goals. Designing and testing a telescope with this sensitivity level requires test equipment with a corresponding level of sensitivity.\u00a0 This kind of future flagship telescope would require high contrast (10-10) and even more demanding contrast stability (10-11).\u00a0 Contrast stability is achieved by maintaining a persistent, or stable, telescope prescription that is defined by the shape and position of all the optical elements. The prescription is affected by surrounding environmental effects like dynamic onboard vibrations from mechanisms and slow drifting temperature changes of the metering structure and optical elements.\u00a0 To attain this remarkable contrast stability, the primary mirror must be stable to roughly <10 picometers RMS over the telescope operational control cycle, which can vary from seconds to minutes depending on the telescope architecture. The team designing the telescope to achieve this objective will need to measure the stability of the components and systems in the telescope to a corresponding level. To make stability measurements at this level requires a new spatial metrology system and new environmental controls. A team at NASA Goddard (consisting of representatives from Goddard, Johns Hopkins University, and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory [SAO]) is developing an ultra-stable laboratory to meet this need. The Ultra-stable Structures Laboratory consists of elements necessary for performing dimensional stability measurements of both dynamic and temporal disturbances.\u00a0 The instrumentation can measure both diffuse and specular surfaces with images rates up to 2 kHz and temperature control < \u00b11 mK.\u00a0 (Image credit: NASA GSFC) Making physical measurements at a picometer scale (which is about 1 million times smaller than the width of a human hair) is challenging.\u00a0 By comparison, precision jet engine components are controlled to tens of microns (10-6 m), and Webb nanometer alignment control levels (at 10-9 m) are 1,000 times smaller than that. The picometer (10-12 m) measurements sought for these next-generation telescopes are yet another 1,000 times smaller than Webb control levels.\u00a0 A classical approach to address such a challenge is to measure the effects of larger-scale disturbances and then assume linear interpolation is applicable to predict the effects of smaller disturbances.\u00a0 The ultra-stable structures team found this approach to be unreliable and learned that systems at the picometer scale do not act in the same linear way as nanometer-level systems. For example, the team discovered that picometer-amplitude vibrations do not necessarily propagate over a mechanically fastened joint; the joint must instead employ an adhesive joint to transmit the disturbance.\u00a0 The level of connectedness or \u201cmechanical intimacy\u201d of joints matters at the picometer scale, and internal stresses and the external environment can play a role that needs to be understood.\u00a0 Therefore, the team\u2019s emphasis has been on measuring picometer spatial changes without testing over larger temperature changes as was done on Webb. The ultra-stable lab system has evolved to the point where the team has measured picometer-level dynamic spatial changes, and recent work has focused on the more difficult measurement of drift (slow changes caused by small temperature changes). The team has made substantial progress on controlling temperatures to sub-milli-Kelvin, and actual drift measurements are in progress.\u00a0 \u200bPrecision measurements require a control of the environment of the test article.\u00a0 The SAO thermal control algorithm demonstrated thermal stability control of a flat glass plate at 26 degrees Celsius.\u00a0 The demonstrated stability is < 350 \u00b5K P-V over 10 hours. (Image credit: NASA GSFC) The team\u2019s general approach is to develop the new metrology methods and equipment required for this level of testing, and to perform incremental testing of ultra-stable telescope building blocks, such as actuators, composite materials, joints, and other materials. The long-term plan is to expand the laboratory infrastructure to be able to characterize large, assembled subsystems and structures. An initial version of this new stability metrology was used on in situ Webb mirror segment measurements in 2015-16 using very low amplitude dynamic stimulation of the entire telescope (see figure below). These early tests demonstrated the ability to identify surface aberrations at picometer-level amplitudes.\u00a0 The current ultra-stable structures lab was set up in 2017 to further develop the metrology. In 2017, the laboratory equipment (hardware and software) could make nanometer-level measurements, and by 2022 the team had evolved the equipment to enable picometer-level measurements.\u00a0 Recently, the team used the lab to measure thermally induced drifts < 3 \u00b1 2 picometers/sec in the surface profile of a flat glass plate. The first version of the High-Speed Interferometer was used to measure Webb mirror segment responses to very small dynamic stimulus (left).\u00a0 The resulting data (right) showed reliable identification of aberrations (depicted as Zernike content) on picometer scales because of the disturbance.\u00a0 (Image credit: NASA GSFC) The team is making progress towards fully demonstrating the metrology and ultrastability methods needed for a future high-contrast telescope. The work to date has built confidence that picometer-scale stability is measurable and controllable. The near-term priority is to make drift measurements at the picometer level. The long-term goals are to increase the complexity and variety of test articles to include larger composite systems that may be used on a future ultra-stable telescope.

The oxidative and thermal instabilities of these systems are widely known, however, and are an impediment to their widespread commercial use. Here, we describe the generation of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-based SAMs on gold that demonstrate considerably greater resistance to heat and chemical reagents than the thiol-based counterparts. This increased stability is related to the increased strength of the gold-carbon bond relative to that of a gold-sulfur bond, and to a different mode of bonding in the case of the carbene ligand. Once bound to gold, NHCs are not displaced by thiols or thioethers, and are stable to high temperatures, boiling water, organic solvents, pH extremes, electrochemical cycling above 0 V and 1% hydrogen peroxide. In particular, benzimidazole-derived carbenes provide films with the highest stabilities and evidence of short-range molecular ordering. Chemical derivatization can be employed to adjust the surface properties of NHC-based SAMs. \n     NCBI Literature Resources \nMeSH\nPMC\nBookshelf\nDisclaimer\n Connect with NLM National Library of Medicine\n8600 Rockville Pike\n                  Bethesda, MD 20894 Web Policies\nFOIA\nHHS Vulnerability Disclosure Help\nAccessibility\nCareers"], "https://www.anselmoacademy.org/why-are-piano-keys-black-and-white/": [" Empowering Students Through the Joy of Music and the Arts Published By: anselmoacademy Published On: December 16, 2021 Published In:                                    \t        \nPiano\n\n Most of us have an understanding of the basics of how the piano works being a pianist. We understand the different patterns there, like the 3 black keys and the 2 black keys that are working to discover the white keys along with the notations and pedaling.  The white keys principally represent the musical tones, while the black ones represent the intervals to half between these musical tones. The colored keys also aid the pianists in deciphering between the semitone and the natural pitches. Being quite a fair question could be the reason behind why the colors were not selected. These black and white keys are a bit boring, right? So, it is important that you take a moment to imagine a piano keyboard that has nothing but white keys. In this article, we will be learning a few basic histories of the piano with the varied styles of the black and white piano keys in them and a few tips and tricks in terms of learning in terms of memorizing the vocations of the keys permanently as well as easily. Did you ever go through the piano keyboard layout? In which way did we get the 88 key piano? Composers in the Baroque and the Renaissance periods had composed for the harpsichord before the piano. The harpsichord is mainly an instrument with 60 keys that relies mainly on the plectrum to strike these internal strings, opposed to the one on the contemporary pianos. So, how many notes on a piano? The limited range for the harpsichord of music was set to an even 5 octaves. The next century witnessed Cristofori\u2019s fortepiano that was developed. It expanded to a 7-octave keyboard by the mid-1800s, which is big enough to express the myriad range of emotions found in the music at that time. The manufacturer of piano Steinway has been debuting to the 88-key piano, with their model having been into standard use ever since. There are 7 octaves included in the 88 key pianos, along with 3 keys below the bottom C. The modern pianos have a piano keyboard layout with 36 black keys and 52 white keys with a single octave equal to the 5 black and 7 white keys. The standard 88-key range of the piano keyboard layout is where the contemporary composers mainly stick to, but there are a few exceptions. So, how many keys does a piano have? It is through Stuart and Sons in 2018, and the word record keyboard consists of 108 keys with 9 octaves. These are a few extra notes on the piano with an added deeper harmonic resonance to the rich sound of this instrument. In the body of every piano, there are several hundreds of independently operating parts there. So, how many keys are on the grand piano? The keys are raised above and are set back from these white keys since most of the modern pianos have about 88 black and white keys that are made out of the 52 longer keys that are white for the notes of the C major scale along with the 36 shorter black keys. So, why are piano keys black and white? If every key on the piano were made out of the same color, they all would appear and look the same. It would therefore make it quite hard for folks to learn to play the piano. The layout of the complete pattern is five black keys and seven white keys. The pianists are going to develop a feel for the geography of the notes by making these black keys thinner and shorter. This similar pattern is repeated a number of times as they depend on the size of the piano. The black keys have flat and sharp notes, while the white ones play the natural notes. So, what are piano keys made of? Ivory is the main material that composed the piano keys, and since this has changed over the period, the trade of ivory has naturally been banned. The pianos that were built about 300 years ago had keys constructed out of wood completely as ivory became their preferred material due to the better durability and quality. They were mainly covered with the strips of ivory as the longer keys generally played a lot more than the shorter ones, and ivory was used since it is a hard-wearing material. The shorter keys were generally played quite less often. They were generally made out of dark wood, including spruce, basswood, black notes, along with the sugar pine. The black and white piano keys were still being termed as ivories. The industry of the pianos got rid of the use of ivory as material for the construction of the keys since the 1970s. After establishing a few of the benefits of playing the piano without having to look at them as it is now time to understand how it is done, the method we are sharing today might be a bit off-beat, but you can learn the best way! Try getting a better feel for the keys, as this is one of the best ways in which you can get to play without looking at your hands. You pretty much know where you are through the means of memorizing, where you can easily switch to a piano of any shape and size. All you need is to close your eyes and make your hands flow on the white keys and push them on higher notes after understanding the role of the black keys on a piano. and check whether you can guess or not. You can feel the massive gap between the two as you are running your hands all across from group 2 of the black notes to group 3. It is an immediate indication that you are on the E and F. The other way you can work on your accuracy and playing without having to look at it is by trying out the random notes. Try making a chart of a few notes and mix them in the flats and sharps. Check to see whether you can hit the note generally, irrespective of which octave you are trying the first time. The other step would be to check whether you can land your finger on any distinctive notes over the various octaves. We would like to begin from middle C and try having a firmer center from where you can work. If you are operating on establishing where the middle C is, then the black and white piano keys will all be clear to you. The scales are the things that you would like to play regularly to warm up, so it is a great way to get a feel of this piano. You need to think about how this feels to you as you are working on up and down, switching between your thumbs, and doing the crosses with fingers. You can, for real, sing your way through this piece if you are able to lock your ear on the specific harmonies and the memories. There are times in which you need to get through a single measure to the next and, not importantly, staring at your hands down. You need not wish to get caught staring them down while it is finding to check out your hands periodically. The best way to get by is by singing through this music. The coolest way in which you can play your pianos without having a glance at them would be by closing your eyes simply and trying to play. We would like you to try it out a couple of times as it is quite awkward to check around at random things at times. Several times these pianists would be thinking about aiming at the thing quite specific, or the distinctive objects in the room would appear quite distracting. There are several beginners out there where pianists would get caught up at the flashy end of the playing. There are places where you can simply enjoy yourself. Mainly these moves would be throwing your arms into the air while you are playing quite fast in the scale of descending chromatic effect! About 99% of the time, people would be staring their hands down while playing the piano since they do not trust them. At times as they know deep down that they have not done enough practice as often, they are quite afraid of taking the risk here. Performing on a piano is a risk that is worth taking!

The couple was married in 1968, following a religious ceremony (vivaha) when she was about 17 (As per her interview to Indian Express on 1 February 2014) and Modi was 18.[6][7][8] Her husband never fully accepted the marriage, and abandoned his parental house shortly after their marriage. In his later life, he did not acknowledge his marriage until he was legally required to do in 2014 during a campaign.[9] Retired from teaching, Jashodaben lives a simple life of prayer.[2]\n Jashodaben was born as Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi in 1952.[7] Her mother died when she was two years old.[7]\n Narendra Modi and Jashodaben had an arranged marriage in the custom of the caste of Vadnagar, starting with a family-arranged betrothal in their very early childhood. According to Narendra Modi's brother, the couple had underwent vivaaha, the religious ceremony of marriage when Narendra Modi was 18 and Jashodaben was about 17.[8]\n A marriage ceremony was held to begin their married life together when she was 17[2][7][10][1][11] and he was 18.\n Modi left his family at age 19 to wander in the Himalayas. After about two years of being out of contact with all who knew him, Modi returned to Vadnagar and contacted his family. He had made plans to go to Ahmedabad to work at his uncle's canteen. At his mother's insistence, Jashodaben came to the family household to maintain their marriage, but her husband objected to the arrangement, insisting on continuing his life on his own terms and encouraging her to continue in her studies.[7][8][11]\n He told me once that \"I will be travelling across the country and will go as and where I please; what will you do following me?\" When I came to Vadnagar to live with his family, he told me \"why did you come to your in-laws' house when you are still so young, you must instead focus on pursuing your studies\". The decision to leave was my own and there was never any conflict between us. He never spoke to me about the RSS or about his political leanings. When he told me he would be moving around the country as he wished, I told him I would like to join him. However, on many occasions when I went to my in-laws' place, he would not be present and he stopped coming there. He used to spend a lot of time in RSS shakhas. So I too stopped going there after a point and I went back to my father's house. Jashodaben said that she spent a total of about three months with her husband during a three-year period before their final separation.[7]\n Jashodaben continued with her professional life, receiving a Secondary School Certificate in 1972[11][12] or 1974,[7][12] completing teacher's training in 1976[7][12] and becoming a teacher in 1978.[11][7][12] From 1978 to 1990, she taught in Banaskantha district.[11] In 1991 she moved to Rajosana village and remains there.[11] She is retired and her pension is \u20b914,000 (US$190) per month.[7] One commentator said that her low salary would have made much of life a hardship for her.[3] Talking about her relationship with Modi, in one interview Jashodaben said \"We have never been in touch... There has been no communication from his end to this day.\"[7] In a later interview Jashodaben said that until 1987, she and Modi spoke \"normally\".[13] Jashodaben lives with her brother Ashok and his wife in Unjha.[3]\n Rumours had long been circulating that Modi was actually married. In 1992, Jashodaben refused to be interviewed by the newspaper Abhiyan when that publication presented a story on the marriage of her and Modi.[14] Darshan Desai, a reporter for The Indian Express, located Jashodaben in May 2002, but she and others in her village had refused to speak to him and he was told to leave the town.[8] In 2009, it was reported that Modi's political enemies had discovered her teaching at a school and living in a one-room tenement. Modi himself did not quite deny that she was his wife, although he did not explicitly acknowledge it either.[11] Her marriage to Modi was said to be common knowledge in her mostly Muslim village.[11] She was reportedly diligent and well liked as a teacher, especially among her Muslim students.[11] When found by a reporter, she became worried and nervous, saying only \"I will not say anything against my husband. He is very powerful. This job is all I have to survive. I am afraid of the consequences.\"[11]\n When required to fill out forms on which his spouse was requested to be identified, Modi had repeatedly been leaving the spousal information section blank or just marked with a dash\u00a0\u2013 including in state assembly elections in 2001, 2002, 2007 and 2012.[15] At political rallies he had said he was single.[14][16][10]\n In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi contested the Vadodara seat in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India.[1] Under the Representation of the People Act and following recent rulings stating that a complete response was mandatory, Modi was required to declare any previous marriage.[10] Following legal advice to \"come clean\" about the issue, for the first time in public and media, Modi acknowledged that he had a wife.[1]\n Sombhai Modi, Narendra Modi's brother, issued a statement saying that the arranged marriage had been forced on Modi by his family.[14] He said that the marriage was never consummated, and that Modi left it soon after it was solemnized.[14] His brother further said that Modi had been inspired by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda to later for society.[14]\n Before Modi officially acknowledged his marriage, a group of activists and security professionals visited Jashodaben at her home.[3] They offered to escort her on the Char Dham pilgrimage, which was a trip which she had long wanted to take.[3] During the trip, they took her to the ashram of Swami Ramdev in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand.[3] Journalists sought Jashodaben for comment at the news of the marriage, but her family told them that she would return home soon.[3]\n To contest the election, Modi's political opponents criticised his evasions of facts about his marriage on official documents. Nishant Varma, a citizen of Ahmedabad, sought criminal charges against Modi for having failed to acknowledge his legal wife and forge previous election documents as against prescribed rules of the Representation of the People Act. The case is subjected to revision in the Supreme Court of India. The lower court refused to pronounce Modi guilty of criminal offense under this Act.[17]\n In summer 2014, Congress party politician Ajay Rai filed a lawsuit to be heard by the Allahabad High Court complaining, among other things, that Modi did not give the permanent account number of Jashodaben.[18]\n In February 2014, a reporter for The Indian Express interviewed her.[7]\n It was reported in April 2014 that she does not speak ill of her husband, and does not tolerate when others do so.[6]\n In May 2014, TV9 Gujarat interviewed her on video.[13]\n In June 2014, at what has been described as \"her first public event\", Jashodaben attended the public funeral of politician Gopinath Munde.[19]\n Jashodaben said that she was not invited to the swearing-in ceremony of Narendra Modi, but had she been invited, she would have gone.[13] \"I wish to be with him. If he calls me, I am eager to start a new life with him.

She is the estranged wife of Narendra\u2005Modi, the prime\u2005minister\u2005of\u2005India. The couple were married in 1968 when she was about 17 and Modi was 18.[6][7][8] A short time into the marriage, her husband abandoned her.[9][10] He did not acknowledge the marriage publicly until he was legally required to do so prior to the 2014 Indian general elections.[11][12][13] Having retired from teaching, Jashodaben is said to lead a simple life of prayer.[2]\n Jashodaben was born as Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi in 1951.[7] Her mother died when she was two years old.[7]\n Narendra Modi and Jashodaben had an arranged\u2005marriage in the custom of the caste of Vadnagar, starting with a family-arranged betrothal in their very early childhood. According to Narendra Modi's brother, the couple had undergone vivaaha, the religious ceremony of marriage when Narendra Modi was 18 and Jashodaben was about 17.[8]\n A marriage ceremony was held to begin their married life together when she was 17[7][14][1][15] and he was 18.[2] Modi abandoned Jashodaben soon after the marriage.[9][11][12][10]\n After about two years of being out of contact with all who knew him, Modi returned to Vadnagar and contacted his family. He had made plans to go to Ahmedabad to work at his uncle's canteen. At his mother's insistence, Jashodaben came to the family household to maintain their marriage, but her husband objected to the arrangement, insisting on continuing his life on his own terms and encouraging her to continue in her studies.[7][8][15]\n He told me once that \"I will be travelling across the country and will go as and where I please; what will you do following me?\" When I came to Vadnagar to live with his family, he told me \"why did you come to your in-laws' house when you are still so young, you must instead focus on pursuing your studies\". The decision to leave was my own and there was never any conflict between us. He never spoke to me about the RSS or about his political leanings. When he told me he would be moving around the country as he wished, I told him I would like to join him. However, on many occasions when I went to my in-laws' place, he would not be present and he stopped coming there. He used to spend a lot of time in RSS shakhas. So I too stopped going there after a point and I went back to my father's house. Jashodaben said that she spent a total of about three months with her husband during a three-year period before their final separation.[7]\n Jashodaben continued with her professional life, receiving a Secondary\u2005School\u2005Certificate in 1972[15][16] or 1974,[7][16] completing teacher's training in 1976[7][16] and becoming a teacher in 1978.[15][7][16] From 1978 to 1990, she taught in Banaskantha\u2005district.[15] In 1991 she moved to Rajosana village and remains there.[15] She is retired and her pension is \u20b914,000 (US$180) per month.[7] One commentator said that her low salary would have made much of life a hardship for her.[3] Talking about her relationship with Modi, in one interview Jashodaben said \"We have never been in touch... There has been no communication from his end to this day.\"[7] In a later interview Jashodaben said that until 1987, she and Modi spoke \"normally\".[17] Jashodaben lives with her brother Ashok and his wife in Unjha.[3]\n Rumours had long been circulating that Modi was actually married. In 1992, Jashodaben refused to be interviewed by the newspaper Abhiyan when that publication presented a story on the marriage of her and Modi.[18] Darshan Desai, a reporter for The\u2005Indian\u2005Express, located Jashodaben in May 2002, but she and others in her village had refused to speak to him and he was told to leave the town.[8] In 2009, it was reported that Modi's political enemies had discovered her teaching at a school and living in a one-room tenement. Modi himself did not quite deny that she was his wife, although he did not explicitly acknowledge it either.[15] Her marriage to Modi was said to be common knowledge in her village.[15] She was reportedly diligent and well liked as a teacher, especially among her students.[15] When found by a reporter, she became worried and nervous, saying only \"I will not say anything against my husband. He is very powerful. This job is all I have to survive. I am afraid of the consequences.\"[15]\n When required to fill out forms on which his spouse was requested to be identified, Modi had repeatedly been leaving the spousal information section blank or just marked with a dash\u00a0\u2013 including in state assembly elections in 2001, 2002, 2007 and 2012.[19] At political rallies he had said he was single.[18][20][14]\n In the 2014\u2005Indian\u2005general\u2005election, Modi contested the Vadodara seat in the Lok\u2005Sabha, the lower\u2005house of the Parliament\u2005of\u2005India.[1] Under the Representation\u2005of\u2005the\u2005People\u2005Act and following recent rulings stating that a complete response was mandatory, Modi was required to declare any previous marriage.[14] Following legal advice to \"come clean\" about the issue, for the first time in public and media, Modi acknowledged that he had a wife.[1]\n Sombhai Modi, Narendra Modi's brother, issued a statement saying that the arranged\u2005marriage had been forced on Modi by his family.[18] He said that the marriage was never consummated, and that Modi left it soon after it was solemnized, thus confirming that the marriage actually never took place.[18] His brother further said that Modi had been inspired by the teachings of Swami\u2005Vivekananda to work for the nation and society.[18]\n Before Modi officially acknowledged his marriage, a group of activists and security professionals visited Jashodaben at her home.[3] They offered to escort her on the Char\u2005Dham pilgrimage, which was a trip which she had long wanted to take.[3] During the trip, they took her to the ashram of Swami\u2005Ramdev in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand.[3] Journalists sought Jashodaben for comment at the news of the marriage, but her family told them that she would return home soon.[3]\n To contest the election, Modi's political opponents criticised his evasions of facts about his marriage on official documents. Nishant Varma, a citizen of Ahmedabad, sought criminal charges against Modi for having failed to acknowledge his legal wife and forge previous election documents as against prescribed rules of the Representation of the People Act. The case is subjected to revision in the Supreme\u2005Court\u2005of\u2005India. The lower court pronounced Modi as not guilty of any criminal offense under this Act.[21]\n In summer 2014, Congress party politician Ajay\u2005Rai filed a lawsuit to be heard by the Allahabad\u2005High\u2005Court complaining, among other things, that Modi did not give the permanent\u2005account\u2005number of Jashodaben.[22]\n In February 2014, a reporter for The\u2005Indian\u2005Express interviewed her.[7]\n It was reported in April 2014 that she does not speak ill of her husband, and does not tolerate when others do so.[6]\n In May 2014, TV9\u2005Gujarat interviewed her on video.[17]\n In June 2014, at what has been described as \"her first public event\", Jashodaben attended the public funeral of politician Gopinath\u2005Munde.[23]\n Jashodaben said that she was not invited to the swearing-in\u2005ceremony\u2005of\u2005Narendra\u2005Modi, but had she been invited, she would have gone.[17] \"I wish to be with him. If he calls me, I am eager to start a new life with him. But it has to be he who calls,\" she said in 2014.[13]\n In November 2014, she made her first trip to Mumbai, where she prayed for her husband at the Mahalakshmi\u2005Temple and the Siddhivinayak\u2005Temple.[24]\n In December 2014, a writer for Pakistani news agency Dawn\u2005News said that not many newspapers have had the courage to report the troubles which Jashodaben has experienced.[25]\n In February 2015, Jashodaben hosted some Christian missionaries who invited her to join their mission to help many destitute and helpless Hindus by teaching Gita and Ramayana to them.[26][failed\u2005verification] In June 2015, Jashodaben was scheduled to speak at a conference on politics organized by supporters of Modi.[27] Event organizers reported that the conference was shut down on the second day of the week-long program on the direction of the BJP leader Amit\u2005Shah and others.[27] No reason was given for cancelling the conference, but people in attendance claimed Jashodaben's presence as the cause.[27]\n In November 2015, Jashodaben applied for a passport in order to visit relatives and friends overseas. As she was unable to produce a marriage certificate or a joint affidavit from her husband, the application was rejected by the regional passport office as \"incomplete\". Her brother Ashok stated that a legal option was being considered.[28]\n \nThe separation of Jashodaben and Modi has been discussed in the context of a broader trend in India that politicians may have more success if they are known for not having ties to a spouse.[29] The RSS, which gives Modi political support, values celibacy in its senior leadership[29] but contrarian tones have been noted.[30]\n Many Congress party politicians have criticised Modi's treatment of the estrangement of his wife.[31][32][33]\n I am surrounded by five security guards all the time. Often my relatives or I have to cook for them, my sister-in-law has to make their beds. This is a bit annoying... You see, it gets really chaotic when I have to travel, because I use public transport and the guards are following me in an air-conditioned car.\n Jashodaben, to Reuters, November 2014[34]\n From May 2014, police from the Mehsana\u2005district began providing continual police protection for Jashodaben.[35] The security agent team following her was assigned as a response to the Special\u2005Protection\u2005Group Act, which says that the spouse\u2005of\u2005the\u2005Prime\u2005Minister\u2005of\u2005India should receive police protection.[36] The Salaries\u2005and\u2005Allowances\u2005of\u2005Ministers'\u2005Act describes other benefits which are typically given to spouses of prime ministers.[36]\n In November 2014, Jashodaben filed a Right\u2005to\u2005Information\u2005Act (RTI) request seeking details about her security and rights as the spouse of the prime minister.[37][38]  Various media organizations in India reported the RTI in different ways, including emphasizing Jashodaben's fear, the financial implications of her complaint, the guards' demands to be treated as guests, or the case as an example of female independence.[34] Jashodaben has said that her security guards have refused to show any identification or to say on whose orders they have been assigned to her, and have suggested she refrain from talking with the media.[4][13] The Gulf\u2005News reported that her security guards are primarily with her to conduct surveillance on her.[13] Jashodaben's family has complained that her guards do not carry any identity cards, refuse to identify themselves, and refuse to name the person or office supervising them.[4]\n In December, the Intelligence\u2005Bureau denied her request for information about orders, saying that the law has an exemption which applies in this case.[38] Jashodaben uses the name \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\", which is her married name.[4] The letter was addressed to \"Jashodaben, daughter of Chimanlal Modi\" (her father's name).[39] At the end of December 2014, Jashodaben filed an appeal to the refusal.[40] In addition to the appeal, Jashodaben complained that the government officers changed her name from \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\" to her maiden name \"Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi\".[40] Doordarshan, India's public television broadcaster, presented Jashodaben on television 1 January 2015 to hear her comments on the issue.[41][42] As a result of this broadcast, the Ministry\u2005of\u2005Information\u2005and\u2005Broadcasting chastised staff at Doordashan and transferred the director of the broadcast from Ahmedabad to Port\u2005Blair 2,500\u00a0km away.[41][42] On 6 February Jashodaben's request was again denied, and again addressed to \"Jashodaben, Chimanlal Modi's daughter\".[43]\n In May 2015, Jashodaben filed a third request for the information about the security detail and their orders.[5] She also complained that she had completed the forms using her legal name, \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\", but the government office replied to her using her maiden name.[4] In response to the filing, a government representative said, \"If they are still not satisfied by the information given by the first appellate authority, they can file the second appeal at the Gujarat Information Commission.\"[4] In response to the RTI request, commentator on women's issues Shobhaa\u2005De called Jashodaben a \"superhero\" and \"plucky\", and said that her actions were \"bold, blunt, and to the point\".[44]\n"], "https://www.zee5.com/articles/party-is-not-neglecting-me-former-karnataka-cm-yediyurappa": [" Refuting the opposition\u2019s allegation that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to finish him off, the former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa said that the party is not neglecting him.

Nadda and B.L. Santhosh, the national president and the general secretary of the BJP, respectively,\u00a0have convened a meeting of all MPs and senior functionaries of the party from Bengal on December 19 in New Delhi.\u00a0 The call from the capital came on Friday evening and the invitees were asked to remain present at the\u00a0residence of party MP and national vice-president Dilip Ghosh for the meeting.\u00a0 This will be the first such meeting since 2020 when all Bengal BJP MPs were asked to turn up in Delhi for a closed door session. Bengal\u2019s leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari has also been invited to the December 19 meeting, which would be attended by the party\u2019s minders for Bengal Sunil Bansal and Mangal Pandey, along with their deputies Asha Lakra and Amit Malviya. \u201cTwo years ago, all MPs were called for a similar meeting at Dilipda\u2019s house\u00a0in Delhi. It was convened by then minder for Bengal, Kailash Vijayvargiyaji,\u201d an MP said. According to sources, the timing of the meeting is significant as the Bengal BJP is preparing for the upcoming panchayat polls, the semi-final before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. It is expected that Nadda and Santhosh will assign specific responsibilities to the MPs and Adhikari ahead of the rural elections, a source said.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe panchayat polls will be a great opportunity to test our strength so that by 2024, we can mend our possible shortcomings. We believe Naddaji and Santhoshji will give us guidance,\u201d another MP said.\u00a0 In the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, the BJP had bagged 18 seats. However, after the resignation of Babul Supriyo and the defection of Arjun Singh, the number has come down to 16. In the Rajya Sabha, BJP doesn\u2019t have any member from Bengal .\u00a0 A source said, before the meeting in Delhi, state leaders will assemble in Calcutta on December 15 and 16 in the presence of Bansal and Pandey.\u00a0"], "https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2022/10/08/pm-ismail-sabri-tops-list-of-sarawak-state-honours-recipients/32387": [" About Us Advertise   KUCHING, Oct 9 \u2015 Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob topped the list of 846 recipients of Sarawak state honours in conjunction with the 86th birthday of the Yang di-Pertua Negri Sarawak Tun Abdul Taib Mahmud, today.

But I don't want to carry the $8000 gear everyday, everywhere with worrying getting stolen or something. So I am looking for a secondary camera as a carry-all-day camera. <br /> 1. my budget for this is about $500 for camera and lens<br /> 2. I don't want to compromise that much for image quality, so film camera looks like to fulfill both.<br /> 3. I prefer rangefinder <br /> 4. I prefer 35mm lens <br /> 5. mostly for street photography</p> <p>So I have following thought:<br /> 1. Non-leica rangefinder: canon QL 17 G-III: No Metering in manual mode<br /> 2. Leica CL + 40mm f2: 40mm, :(<br /> 3. Leica M2/M3 + some lens (lens quality can be compromised)<br /> 4. _____</p> <p>The good side for Option 3 is that I can share lens between the film camera and my leica M9. But the down side is that there is no way i can find a combo of M2/M3 with lens around $500 (or is it there any unknown lens). </p> <p>Any thought would be very welcome. Thanks in advanced.</p> Have you considered the M 8 perhaps above your budget but changes effective FL of lenses.  If you plan to use the new  \nbody a lot you will find film is expensive. While I love and shoot film I find it a luxury these days given the cost.   \nAlternatively the Bessarabia bodies are quite cheap as are the recent cosina Zeiss ikon bodies.  An M6 is also a  \nreasonable buy. <p>Hi John, <br> \nCan you suggest a lens as well? I can't find any lens to go with Voigtlander in that price range. thank you very much.</p> <p>As you like the 35mm ASPH f2, what about the Hexar AF if you find a well kept one. The lens is close to the non-aspherical Summicron in rendition and the Hexar is also available in the silent model which is good for some close up street photography.</p> \n<p>An M2 or M3 in very good shape will not allow you to remain in budget. Some photographers like the CL and 40 Summicron. I had one for a few years and do not miss the camera body at all. The classic small VC 35m f2.5 is a very fine lens which sells for about 250$ in clean shape. Useable on your M9 as well with LTM-M adapter. Maybe you can find a nice Bessa RF to go with it, but the Bessa shutters are noisy.</p> \n<p>Try to find a Hexar and handle it. I think you may be surprised by its quality. Only downside is that its shutter top speed is limited to around 1/200 or 1/300, but no big deal for much street shooting.</p> <p>Hi Arthur, <br> \nThank you for the suggestion.<br> \nI tried to googled a little bit about VC 35m f2.5 and most of places sell it at about $500. I will continue digging. if I can get one with Voigtlander body, then it's likely the combo I am looking for. <br> \nAs for the Hexar, that seems a pretty good alternative. I actually saw it when I was searching for non-leica rangefinder the other day, but found few selling online, and people said it's not real rangefinder so I didn't try further. </p> <p>Zekai, true, the Hexar AF is a viewfinder - autofocus RF camera and getting to understand its various controls is not as easy as some cameras. If I were street shooting mainly and having to think more about composing the image than quickly finding (or pre-focussing) a focus sweet point, I might go for a more automatic rangefinding VF camera like the Hexar. My M film Leicas and M9 are true rangefinders, but sometimes it is nice to have a holiday from them while retaining a VF camera view of the world.</p> \n<p>I've not used the Hexar so this is only a personal preference rather than actual experience.</p> \n<p>The complete listings on the big auction site mainly show prices between about $300 and $350 for the LTM version of the 35mm f2.5 V-C lens.</p> <p>You can't beat a clean, <strong>Canon 17 GIII</strong> for bang for the buck. Terrific quality lens, bright finder, manual and auto exposure. Super quiet and very compact too. I carry mine on a little Lowepro belt bag. It costs so little, it's practically disposable. What more do you need? Figure $80 for the camera and $100 for a CLA and you are done.</p> \n<p>Another even more compact/stealthy little guy is the <strong>Ricoh 500G</strong>, Find a black one for around $75, silver around $50. Seriously small, sharp as a tack. Full manual or auto exposure. Leaf shutter quiet. Almost always needs new seals. Interslice has seal kits. Some find it <em>too</em> small for the hands so YMMV. I really like it.</p> \n<p> </p><div></div> <p><a href=\"http://www.dantestella.com/technical/contaxt.html\">Contax T</a> <<< Click</p> \n<blockquote> \n<p>\"The lens is a unit-focusing 38mm f/2.8(16) Sonnar T* (5-element) with a seven-blade aperture. It is T* multicoated <strong>-</strong> <strong>Rangefinder and limitations:</strong> What limitations? With a 38mm lens, a rangefinder is the icing on the cake!\"<em><strong> Dante Stella</strong></em></p> \n</blockquote> You may consider the contax G series.  Prices have gone up a bit of late but I like mine.  The G2 is quite a lot more  \nexpensive than the G1 as the AF is better and it has the rear AF button to make things easier.  That said my G1 works  \nfine (as well as Leica I have two G2 s and a G1). If possible get theG1 with the modification (green sticker In the film  \ncompartment so you can use the 35mm lens.  Unfortunately NEX and M43 have driven up lens prices but you should get  \nthe G1 for about$200-250 and either the 45 F2 or 35 F2.  The 45 is a slightly better lens but both are excellent -  \ncomparable to my Leica lenses.  Lens prices have risen but you should be able to get them in the $300-$350 range. <p>Thank you all for your suggestion.<br> \nHi Gus, Dan, when I use my 35mm lens on my M9, I actually don't feel the viewline that much useful, cuz the view I can see outside the 35mm is very small, unlike using an 50mm. (I am not saying  I don't like it though, just not much useful. completely personal opinion). So I will probably be okay to live with the leica cl's. And I will spend some time look at the contax T. <br> \nHi Clive, I actually had given this a thought. But yes, either way I should probably get one for my current gears. Thank you for this.<br> \nHi Dan, Yes. I am watching for some auction now. </p> \n<p> </p> <p>Hi all,<br> \nThank you for all the suggestions. That gives me a broad view of the options for me. <br> \nI know I've already asked too much -- budget but good image quality. But I would like to add one more, among those equipments you guys suggested, are they all useable in rain and snow and won't break soon? Since I would like to carry it all day, chances are I need to use it in pouring and blizzard occasionally. If from this point of view, without specifically going into a weather sealed camera like nikonos, which would you recommend.<br> \nThank you.</p> <p>I am unsure why you would buy one of the most expensive (probably the most expensive) commercially available digital cameras, and cheap out on a film camera. Obviously IQ is important to you. Not a criticism, just don't understand it. I would spend the appropriate amount needed in order to get what I want, as I have too much experience w/ not doing that. It's never worked for me. $500 is a lot of money to me, and will buy you a very nice camera.</p> \n<p>It's always fun to audition gear, and I don't know how something will work until it's in my hands, so my normal mode is to buy several cameras that I think might work. What doesn't work gets sold, and I get to keep the pick of the litter, at least for my needs.</p> <p>HI Knut and Mukul, Thank you for you suggestion. Also looks like built-in meter is something that I am gonna miss and force myself to improve the skill on exposure control. But that might be good for me. <br> \nHi Steve, you are right. What I am doing makes little sense. As I explained in one of my previous reply, because I would like to carry it everywhere, every day. But I don't want to always put an eye closely on it, distracting myself from other things. $500 is something I can afford to lose, say once a several years. (Another example, I got my current phone at $300 and sometime after work I carried my macbook air with me to a bar. I never worry about my phone get stolen but I do worry about my laptop in that case). <br> \nAlso in a situation like a pouring or blizzard, I won't feel that bad to shoot with a cheaper camera. <br> \nAnd yes, I used to do similar thing like you did -- when I was using dslr, I bought 4 lenses to play with and eventually only kept one, using for long time until I changed to rangefinder. I am actually thinking of getting two from above folks' suggestions and play with them until I decide which one to go with for long. <br> \nThanks. </p> <p>The truth is that with any old camera, built-in meters are dubious. If they still work, that may be only temporary.</p> \n<p>I second the recommendations for the Canonet series - the only one to avoid, and it's only troublesome because of its dependence on the meter, is the Canonet 28.</p> \n<p>There are a number of older Ricoh models, including the 500G, that are worth considering. I went on a Ricoh jag a while back and found them all to be excellent and fun cameras<strong>:</strong><br /><strong>Ricoh 500G</strong> - <a href=\"/classic-cameras-forum/00Xkkc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.photo.net/classic-cameras-forum/00Xkkc</a><br /><strong>Ricoh 500</strong> - <a href=\"/classic-cameras-forum/00XiNm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.photo.net/classic-cameras-forum/00XiNm</a><br /><strong>Ricoh HI-COLOR 35</strong> - <a href=\"/classic-cameras-forum/00XKwq\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.photo.net/classic-cameras-forum/00XKwq</a></p> \n<p>The HI-COLOR 35 is unusual in having a very effective wind-up advance motor.</p> <p>Hi all,</p> \n<p>Thanks for all the reply.

Yes they can be convienient but is it really a utility? Highlights1 TB MicroSD Cards are available in the market for a high cost1 TB MicroSD Cards are supported by budget phones1 TB MicroSD Cards can be replaced with more efficient alternatives More storage is equal to more stuff. In simpler words, more storage means you can store more files, photos, videos, music, movies or whatever other things you have in the device you want to store them into. And what better device than a smartphone that we use daily in our lives. For this very simple reason, smartphone storage have gone from a mere 16GB till a few years back to up to 1 TB this year, even for MicroSD cards. Now, this expandable storage can also go up to 2TB which is a lot for a smartphone. This means a phone with 128GB of internal storage can support up to 2TB of memory using an external MicroSD card. That much storage may sound and look tempting. However, one shouldn\u2019t forget about the cost connected to such an expandable storage card. Usually, the price of a 1 TB SD card is super high and can range from Rs 6,000 to a whopping Rs 23,000. So spending that much money on an SD Card is worth it or just a sham? Here\u2019s our take. If you are purchasing a phone with half a terabyte of storage, such as a Galaxy S21 Ultra, you may not need an SD Card for external storage. But if you are purchasing a mid-range or budget device such as a Samsung Galaxy M52, or a Realme 8s, the effective cost of buying a smartphone goes way too high. For instance, the Galaxy M52 with only 128 gigs of internal storage starts at Rs 29,999 and buying a good quality external 1 TB MicroSD card, such as from SanDisk, could cost you an extra Rs 15,000. That takes the effective cost of the phone from Rs 29,999 to Rs 44,999. And at this cost, it becomes absurd to purchase this smartphone. So instead, at Rs 45,000, you can get an iQOO 7 Legend that is a better smartphone, with 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and still have Rs 1,000 left with you. Read More: Indian Cloud Storage service \u2018Digiboxx\u2019 launched by NITI Aayog If you love Samsung smartphones, you can wait for an offer on the Galaxy S20 FE 5G that was being sold for Rs 34,000 during Amazon Great Indian Festival. This device, with an offer, will cost you less and also supports expandable storage. Coming to budget smartphones, the Realme 8s starts at Rs 17,999 with 128GB of storage. Adding Rs 15,000 more, the cost goes up to Rs 33,000. At this range, you can get the iQOO 7 for Rs 31,990, which is again a far better smartphone in terms of specifications and levels up the segment to a flagship. One might argue that a 1 TB MicroSD card can also be purchased at approximately Rs 6,000. Yes, you can, but it\u2019s not from a known brand and if things ever go haywire, you may not get proper support and will end up losing even more money. On the other hand, at Rs 5,000, you can get a 512GB MicroSD Card from SanDisk which is far more reliable if an SD card is really what you want. Apple iPhone 14 Pro Review: Pro Enough? So, what are some of the alternatives you can look at? Well, the most obvious one is Cloud Storage. It is not only convenient but also secure enough. Plus, you can access it from anywhere in the world at any time. A MicroSD card might get corrupted, or if you ever lose your phone, the MicroSD card goes with it, hence, a big loss for you. Moreover, you might lose all of your data because of these issues if you don\u2019t have a backup. Cloud Storage solves both of these issues. A 2 TB premium plan from Google as a part of the Google One service will set you back Rs 6,500 every year. With this, you are not only paying for the storage, but also for some of the extra benefits such as exclusive Google Photos editing tools, priority Google service and more. Similarly, Microsoft also provides its Microsoft365 plans. At Rs 4,899 per year, you get 1 TB of storage where you can store all your data. As you might have understood by this point, we think that a 1TB MicroSD card is purely a sham. It\u2019s a costly and a non-efficient way of managing your data. However, if you are still in favour of buying it, we suggest that you go for a card with less storage such as a 128GB or maybe 256GB which is still justifiable compared to a 1 TB card.

Mr Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party said that spokeswoman Nupur Sharma was suspended for breaching the party's constitution and expressing views contrary to its \u201cposition on various matters\u201d. The party said the suspension would remain effective until its disciplinary committee completed an internal inquiry against her. It also expelled another top media official, Naveen Kumar Jindal, over derogatory social media posts it said had breached \u201ccommunal harmony\u201d and went against its \u201cfundamental beliefs\u201d. \u201cThe offensive tweets and comments denigrating a religious personality were made by certain individuals,\u201d India's external affairs ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi said. \u201cThey do not, in any manner, reflect the views of the government of India. Strong action has already been taken against these individuals by relevant bodies. India accords the highest respect to all religions.\u201d The BJP action follows international and domestic outrage and street violence in India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state, where a curfew was imposed in some areas after Muslim and Hindu men clashed on streets on Friday. Nupur Sharma in New Delhi in 2015. Getty Images  Nayef Falah Al Hajraf, Secretary General of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), said he \u201ccondemned, rejected and denounced\u201d the statements. \u201cWe affirm our categorical rejection of any prejudice towards all prophets, apostles and religious personalities and symbols,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also reject provocation, or the targeting or belittling of religions and beliefs.\u201d The UAE condemned the statements made by the spokeswoman for the BJP, and expressed its \u201ccondemnation and rejection of insulting the Prophet Mohammed\u201d. In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation affirmed the UAE's firm rejection of \u201call practices and behaviours that contradict moral and humanitarian values \u200b\u200band principles\u201d. The ministry called for the need to respect religious symbols and not violate them, confronting hate speech and violence and strengthening the joint international responsibility to spread the values \u200b\u200bof tolerance and human coexistence, and to prevent any practices that would inflame the religious feelings of followers of different religions. Qatar and Kuwait have launched diplomatic protests against the pair's statements and called Indian envoys in the respective countries to their foreign offices to lodge strong protests. Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also condemned the remarks. The kingdom said it rejected prejudice against symbols of the Islamic religion and religious figures, and that all faiths must be respected. The Indian embassy in Qatar said that the tweets were the views of \u201cfringe elements\u201d and did not represent those of the Indian government. Egypt\u2019s Al Azhar Mosque, the Sunni world\u2019s foremost institution of religious learning, described the remarks as \u201creal terrorism [that] can plunge the entire world into severe crises and deadly wars.\u201d \u201cAl Azhar condemns the blatant and ill-mannered comments about the Messenger of God Muhammad, peace be upon him, and his wife, the Mother of the Faithful, the pure Lady Aisha,\u201d the institution said in a statement. The inflammatory remarks, it said, \"only served to reveal a flagrant ignorance of the history of the prophets and how they represented the highest morals\u201d. The Al Azhar statement accused the BJP of using the already tense relationship between India's Hindu majority and its Muslim minority to curry votes in forthcoming elections. \"It is an explicit call to extremism and to spreading hatred and sedition among followers of different religions,\" it said. Mr Modi\u2019s party said that it respected all religions and denounced insults against any religious figure. It did not elaborate on the incidents or identify anyone. \u201cAs India celebrates [the] 75th year of its independence, we are committed to making India a great country where all are equal and everyone lives with dignity, where all are committed to India's unity and integrity, where all enjoy the fruits of growth and development,\u201d the BJP said. Both of the officials have issued defensive statements while retracting their comments. Their remarks have caused outrage among India\u2019s Muslim population of about 200 million. Hundreds of Muslims and Hindus threw stones at each other on Friday in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Kanpur city in the north of the country. The unrest followed a call to demonstrate by a Muslim group, prompting counter-protests by Hindus that escalated into violence. At least three people were injured in the clashes, with police arresting nearly two dozen people, mostly organisers of the demonstrations. Prohibitory orders have also been imposed in the state\u2019s Bareilly district, where a Muslim religious group has called for a mass protest rally on June 10 against the derogatory comments. Meanwhile, the remarks also stirred anger in India\u2019s neighbour, Pakistan, and in Afghanistan. On Monday, Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry summoned an Indian diplomat and conveyed Islamabad\u2019s \u201cstrong condemnation\u201d. This came after Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the comments were \u201churtful\u201d and \u201cIndia under Modi is trampling religious freedoms and persecuting Muslims\u201d. India on Monday criticised Pakistan over its reaction, accusing it of being a \u201cserial violator\u201d and demanding that it focus on the safety of its minorities. \u201cThe absurdity of a serial violator of minority rights commenting on the treatment of minorities in another nation is not lost on anyone,\u201d Mr Bagchi said. \u201cWe call on Pakistan to focus on the safety, security and well-being of its minority communities, instead of engaging in alarmist propaganda and attempting to foment communal disharmony in India.\u201d Criticism also came from Afghanistan, which said the Indian government should not allow \u201csuch fanatics to insult \u2026 Islam and provoke the feelings of Muslims\u201d. The BJP also faced anger from some of its own supporters, but for a different reason. Many Hindu nationalists posted comments on social media saying the government was buckling under international pressure."], "https://www.amazon.com/Why-My-Piano-Black-White/dp/1999753011": [" Download the free Kindle app and start reading Kindle books instantly on your smartphone, tablet, or computer - no Kindle device required.

According to Wikipedia, the national honours which are awarded yearly are backed by the National Honours Act No 5 of 1964. It should be noted that these honours are quite different from the ones given by the traditional chieftaincy institution.  While the government decides who gets what, an awardee may turn down the honour as was in the case of Chinua Achebe who rejected his in 2004. Below are, therefore, the honours in two categories: - Grand Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic (GCFR) - Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic (CFR) - Officer of the Order of the Federal Republic (OFR) - Member of the Order of the Federal Republic (MFR) Read also Release all top police officers attached to EFCC - IGP orders Bawa - Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger (GCON) - Commander of the Order of the Niger (CON) - Officer of the Order of the Niger (OON) - Member of the Order of the Niger (MON) The GCFR is the highest of the titles and it is given to the country's president, while the vice president gets the GCON. The title of the CON is awarded to the supreme justices of Nigeria.

ABOUT NNCO Nanotechnology is the understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale, at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nanometers, where unique phenomena enable novel applications. Matter can exhibit unusual physical, chemical, and biological properties at the nanoscale, differing in important ways from the properties of bulk materials, single atoms, and molecules. Some nanostructured materials are stronger or have different magnetic properties compared to other forms or sizes of the same material. Others are better at conducting heat or electricity. They may become more chemically reactive, reflect light better, or change color as their size or structure is altered. Although modern nanoscience and nanotechnology are relatively new, nanoscale materials have been used for centuries. Gold and silver nanoparticles created colors in the stained-glass windows of medieval churches hundreds of years ago. The artists back then just didn\u2019t know that they were using nanotechnology to create these beautiful works of art! Nanotechnology encompasses nanoscale science, engineering, and technology in fields such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, and engineering.

On 25 July 2017, when Ram Nath Kovind took oath as the 14th President of India, his Dalit identity was similarly drummed up, particularly by the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as an example of its commitment towards the backward castes. It was felt that the appointment of Kovind, a former Supreme Court lawyer, Rajya Sabha member, and Governor of Bihar \u2013 and also a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) faithful \u2013 as head of state was a political masterstroke on the part of the ruling party. It was also seen as a step that would go a long way in mitigating the BJP\u2019s anti-Dalit image \u2013 an image that had become reinforced by the furore over the suicide of Rohith Vemula, a Dalit student at the University of Hyderabad, in 2016, and the flogging of several members of a Dalit family on the pretext of \u201ccow protection\u201d in Una in Gujarat the same year. As India gets a new President, it is time to look back on Ram Nath Kovind's term and take stock of what this soft-spoken, mild-mannered head of state will be remembered for. In the last five years, India was faced with several tumultuous events, starting from the CAA to the abrogation of Article 370 to farmers' struggle. In each of these cases, Kovind supported the government steadfastly. Kovind has not been known to speak up even when a particularly heinous offence against a Dalit person came to light. This is striking given he was so insistently placed in the context of his caste. No matter what the subject, Kovind\u2019s words have never betrayed a single note of dissonance from the government\u2019s gung-ho messaging. Will Droupadi Murmu build on Kovind\u2019s legacy or find her own voice and carve out a distinct and emphatic path? Today, as President Kovind readies to leave the Rashtrapati Bhavan to make way for his worthy successor, Droupadi Murmu, it is time to look back on his term and take stock of what this soft-spoken, mild-mannered head of state will be remembered for. India went through several tumultuous events during the five years of President Kovind\u2019s tenure as the country\u2019s head of state. In August 2019, the BJP government at the Centre took the controversial decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, which had granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Soon after, the country was convulsed with protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The COVID-19 pandemic hit India in March 2020, destroying thousands of lives and livelihoods. Further, even as the pandemic raged on, starting in end-2020, there were widespread farmers\u2019 protests against three farm laws brought in by the government. In each of these cases, the President stood behind the government and supported its decisions. He put his stamp of approval on the repeal of Article 370 and in multiple speeches thereafter, referred to the move as a landmark step that made the people of India happy. In his address to Parliament on 31 January 2020, he termed the CAA, which was roiling the country at the time, \u201ca historic law\u201d. In the same speech, he said, \u201cMy government is taking strong steps for making this decade India\u2019s decade.\u201d Kovind has also frequently lauded the government\u2019s efforts in tackling the pandemic and in vaccinating large swathes of the population.  It is of course true that the constitutional post of the President of India is largely ceremonial and that he or she is expected to act on the instruction of the government of the day, led by the Council of Ministers. That said, the office of the President is supposed to hold its allegiance to the Constitution above all else. In keeping with that objective, other Presidents before Kovind have been known to occasionally voice their disapproval of the government and its acts of commission or omission. Kovind\u2019s immediate predecessor, the late Pranab Mukherjee, was remarkably outspoken. From pulling up the NDA government for its over-use of ordnances to push legislation through, to expressing his dismay over the climate of intolerance that had descended upon India in the wake of the Dadri lynching in 2015, to ticking off the Opposition for disrupting parliamentary proceedings, Mukherjee spoke his mind on several occasions and repeatedly stressed the need to safeguard the country\u2019s constitutional values of inclusivity and diversity against intolerance and mob frenzy.  We have not heard similar statesman-like words from President Kovind. It could be that he never felt the need to sound a cautionary note because he was always fully satisfied with the way the government was running the country. But what of the increasing incidence of crimes against Dalits? Should President Kovind have weighed in on that? While it is problematic to look at a person\u2019s achievements through the prism of their caste identity, since Kovind, India\u2019s second Dalit President after KR Narayanan, was so insistently placed in the context of his caste, it is perhaps not unreasonable to examine his contribution in protecting the interests of Dalits. It is a fact that across India, incidents of assault, rape and murder of Dalits occur almost daily. As many as 1,38,825 cases of crimes against Dalits were registered between 2018 and 2020, Union Minister Ramdas Athawale told Parliament in March this year. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), in 2020, crimes against Scheduled Caste communities rose by 9.4% over the previous year, while those against Scheduled Tribes went up by 9.3% during the same period. These are sobering statistics. However, President Kovind has not been known to speak up even when a particularly heinous offence against a Dalit person came to light. This rather puts paid to the valorisation of his own Dalit identity and the assumption that as President, he was to be a forceful voice in support of his community. Even though India has been buffeted by economic, social, political and communal tensions in these last five years, even though there have been mass agitations and unrest, Kovind\u2019s presidency itself has been calm waters. It has been an exercise in mildness, marked by anodyne speeches and unstinting support for the government. It will be interesting to see whether India\u2019s next President, Droupadi Murmu, builds on Kovind\u2019s legacy or finds her own voice and carves out a distinct and emphatic path.

Former President Pranab Mukherjee is being invited to the event. The news of the invite to Mukherjee came after speculation on television channels that Congress had decided to leave him out of the guest list.     Amid a row over Muhammad Ali Jinnah's portrait on Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) campus, Haryana finance minister Captain Abhimanyu on Sunday demanded the varsity be named after 'Jat king' Mahendra Pratap Singh.   After its trailer launch at the Parliament House, Tigmanshu Dhulia's movie Raag Desh was screened for the President Pranab Mukherjee and Vice President Mohammad Hamid Ansari at the auditorium in Rashtrapati Bhawan.   Vice-President Mohammad Hamid Ansari spoke deeply of his love for books while inaugurating the 19th National Convention on Knowledge, Library and Information Networking 2016 at Tezpur University on Wednesday.

The equivalent RGB values are (32, 32, 32), which means it is composed of\n33% red, 33% green and 33% blue. The CMYK color codes, used in printers, are C:0 M:0 Y:0 K:88. In the HSV/HSB scale, Piano Black has a hue of 359\u00b0, 0% saturation and a brightness value of 13%.Details of other color codes including equivalent web safe and HTML & CSS colors are given in the table below. Also listed are the closest Pantone\u00ae (PMS) and RAL colors. Piano Black is not part of the web colors list and, therefore, cannot be used by name in HTML and CSS code. The best way to apply the color to a web page is to put in the hex, RGB and/or HSL values. Please also note that the CMYK numbers mentioned on this page have been calculated from the hex code using well-known formulae and are only approximations. The complement of Piano Black is Raisin Black with the hex code #202020. Complementary colors are those found at the opposite ends of the color wheel. Thus, as per the RGB system, the best contrast to #202020 color is offered by #202020. The complementary color palette is easiest to use and work with. Studies have shown that contrasting color palette is the best way to grab a viewer's attention. The analogous colors of Piano Black (#202020) are Raisin Black (#202020) and Raisin Black (#202020). In the RGB color wheel, these two analogous colors occur to the right and left of Piano Black with a 30\u00b0 separation on either side. An analogous color palette is extremely soothing to the eyes and works wonders if your main color is soft or pastel. As per the RGB color wheel, the split-complementary colors of Piano Black (#202020) are #202020 (Raisin Black) and #202020 (Raisin Black). A split-complementary color palette consists of the main color along with those on either side (30\u00b0) of the complementary color. Based on our research, usage of split-complementary palettes is on the rise online, especially in graphics and web sites designs. It may be because it is not as contrasting as the complementary color palette and, hence, results in a combination which is pleasant to the eyes. Piano Black triadic color palette has three colors each of which is separated by 120\u00b0 in the RGB wheel. Thus, #202020 (Raisin Black) and #202020 (Raisin Black) along with #202020 create a stunning and beautiful triadic palette with the maximum variation in hue and, therefore, offering the best possible contrast when taken together. The tetradic palette of Piano Black has four colors - #202020 (Raisin Black), #202020 (Raisin Black) and #202020 (Raisin Black) in addition to the base color (#202020). A tetradic color palette is complex and, in most cases, should not be used off-the-shelf. We suggest tweaking the colors slightly to achieve desired results. Piano Black square color palette has #202020 (Raisin Black), #202020 (Raisin Black) and #202020 (Raisin Black). Quite like triadic, the hues in a square palette are at the maximum distance from each other, which is 90\u00b0.Note: For several colors purposes, a square palette may look much better than the tetrad color palette. Our Piano Black rainbow color palette is based on the RGB model and consists of 7 colors, just like the traditional rainbow. You might not see a lot of variation in color, especially if the chosen color is dark or extremely light. However, this can lead interesting rainbow palettes that are faded, soft, pastel or dull. \nBlog\n  \u00a0 | \u00a0\n  Contact\n  \u00a0 | \u00a0\n  About\n  \u00a0 | \u00a0\n  Privacy\n \u00a9 2022 Color-Name.com.

He had the necessary security with him, still the Hindu Yuva Vahini-ABVP activists could reach near his place of stay. The pretext of the armed protesters was that Mohd. Ali Jinnah\u2019s portrait was put up to please Ansari and that they wouldn\u2019t allow Jinnah\u2019s portrait in AMU. The usual violence followed, few Vahini volunteers were arrested, most of them were then let off. This has been followed by series of statements from Yogi Adityanath, who incidentally is also the founder of this Hindutva group, saying that portrait will not be allowed. Subramaniam Swami questioned as to who will teach a lesson to AMU! The students of AMU are on the protest against the violence unleashed by Vahini and ABVP. Too many angles to the story! First of all how did the armed volunteers of Vahini and ABVP reach near the place where Hamdi Ansari was staying? One recalls that on every occasion there has been an attempt to humiliate this distinguished scholar and diplomat who held the high office. His photo of not saluting the Republic day parade, hinting he is disrespecting, was made viral only to bring in the realisation that he was following the rule book as only the President salutes and no one else. When he was given a farewell, Modi hinted at him being a Muslim and him being attached to issues related to Muslims as if it were a humiliation. In this light, him being targeted is just the continuation of what the RSS combine has been doing to Ansari so far. How did someone suddenly recall that Jinnah\u2019s portrait was there on campus and how did the armed volunteers sneak into the AMU campus? Was the portrait put up just before the Ansari\u2019s arrival. Quite contrary to that, the portrait has been there from 1938, as AMU students Union had conferred a rare honor on him by giving him life membership of AMUSU. The statement was that Jinnah divided the country, so how could we celebrate him. The role played by Jinnah in the freedom movement is not a linear one and is not uniform. He began as a part of the movement and was part of it in the beginning. He was the Chairman of the reception committee, which welcomed Gandhi on his return from South Africa. He was the one who fought the case in which Bal Gangadhar Tilak was given the death sentence and it was due to his legal brilliance that he could save Tilak\u2019s life. He was also the lawyer for the young revolutionary, Sardar Bhagat Singh, and to cap it all he entered into a Hindu-Muslim unity pact with Tilak (Lucknow, 1916). India\u2019s nightingale Sarojini Naidu called Jinnah as the \u2018ambassador of Hindu Muslim unity\u2019. There is another side to the story also. He dissociated from national movement once Gandhi launched the non-cooperation movement in 1920, in which for the first time the regular people of the country were involved. This movement laid the foundation of the biggest ever mass movement in the history of the World. Jinnah was a constitutionalist and he felt involving citizens in the struggle against British is unwarranted. Similarly he opposed Gandhi\u2019s role in the Khilafat movement and gradually dissociated from active involvement in politics and left for London to practice law. The second major flaw which transformed Jinnah, who was basically secular, was his associating with and leading Muslim League. Muslim League was given the status of being the representative of Muslims by British. This was a motivated exercise by British as Muslim League began from the Nawabs and Landlords, with feudal values inherent in it down to the core. His role as a leader of the Muslim League and his Lahore resolution of a separate country for Muslims, Pakistan, is what made him a communal leader. To blame him alone for partition of the country is a distorted presentation of history of modern India. The process of partition was begun by the British who pursued the policy of \u2018divide and rule\u2019. This was supplemented by communalists from both Hindu and Muslim. Savarkar was the first one to articulate that there are two nations in the country, the Hindu and the Muslim. As per this understanding the country belongs to Hindus, so the Muslim nation will have to remain subordinate to Hindus. This is where Jinnah falls in the communal trap and the logic he puts forward is, if there are two nations in the country, so why not two countries? So why not Pakistan? Jinnah that way has been the subject of various biographies and interpretations. His August 11, 1947, speech in Pakistan Constituent Assembly, where he stated that people were free to follow their own religion and that the state wouldn\u2019t interfere in that, elaborated his secular values. Advani, quite late in his life, after having launched the biggest attack on secular values by demolishing Babri Mosque, realised that Jinnah was secular. He called Jinnah secular and paid with his career as the RSS combine was built on the understanding of \u2018Hate Jinnah\u2019, and had presented Jinnah as a symbol of Indian Muslims and Jinnah as a symbol of India\u2019s enemy Pakistan! With this AMU episode, the Hindu nationalist politics is killing many birds with a single stone. First, was to target Hamid Ansari, whom they don\u2019t approve of as his credentials are thoroughly secular. Second is to create yet another divisive issue in the form of Jinnah\u2019s portrait, to add to other emotive issues manufactured so far. And thirdly, to intimidate the AMU campus in line with what has been done in JNU, Hyderabad universities, to name the few. One can say the ghost of Jinnah, who can be called a \u2018Secular soul in a Communal body\u2019, will keep visiting us, and RSS combine through its efforts will keep propping up divisive issues one after the other!

The main aim of technology is to make things easy for us. With this same motive, another innovative product is existing in the market for quite some time now. Spy cameras which are basically hidden cameras are meant to make us feel safe in our surroundings. Some of the most common reasons for using spy cameras are \u2013 Some of the features that you should consider in a hidden camera are \u2013 This will enable you to listen and also u can be heard on the other side. It is useful if you have children, pets, or elder people at home. It is better to go for full-HD cameras with 1080P resolution. It will provide excellent images and will also work efficiently in low-light situations. Also, check the night vision capabilities of a camera. Most portable cameras operate on battery. However, its battery power should be capable of handling the length of the time for which it is needed to remain at work. It is better to go for cameras with motion sensors. They will save battery power and storage space as it will work only when it detects motion and will keep on recording up to at least 2 minutes after the motion stops. Check that the camera is compatible with your phone so that you can check the status of your home or office anytime and from anywhere. Some cameras which are compatible with a smartphone provide the option of downloading the recording directly from their app. While there are some which have the micro SD card storage option and automatically record every second in that SD card.

Though you can use spy cameras for your own benefits like keeping an eye on your child or pets or any of your elderly relatives, it is important to understand that you should not misuse them by any chance. It has been created for benefiting people not for harassing someone by invading their privacy. You should always be aware of that. P.S. Don\u2019t misuse this type of spy gadget to violate others\u2019 privacy, for fair usage and other legal issues that are associated with Surveillance Laws in India, read this article. Some of the best ones are mentioned above in the list. Like a pen camera, a bulb camera, a camera in the charger, or the body camera. The mini body camera and the pen camera that has been mentioned above are a couple of the best mini spy cameras. They are portable and you can carry them anywhere you want. Though till now there are no such strict legal acts against the invasion of privacy, still using it with wrong motives of harassing someone can lead to punishments. Spy cameras are small tiny cameras invented with the aim that people can keep a watch on their home when or their office when they are not there so that they can secure their surroundings to some extent and in case of any mishap they can identify the culprit. Not all, but some hidden cameras need a wifi connection to operate. Though, the time limit varies from camera to camera. However, battery-powered cameras can work till their battery lasts, while cameras that require Wi-Fi can work till there is a Wi-Fi connection. Also, if a camera does not overwrite the previous recordings automatically, then it can record videos only till the time it will have storage space on its SD cards. Then they can again store recordings only after the memory is being cleared manually. Get fast access to gadgets, tech news & deals! Thank you for subscribing. Something went wrong.

It is also known as the National Democratic Alliance Army-Eastern Shan State (NDAA-ESS)[2] and as the Mongla Army or Mongla Group, the latter owing to its location in the in Mongla area in eastern Shan State, known also as 'Shan State Special region 4'.[3]\n The Mongla area had been under the control of several warlords since the 1960s.[4] The NDAA was formed in 1989 after splitting from the former Communist Party of Burma (CPB). The strength of the army is around 3,000 men.[5]\n The NDAA was one of the first groups to agree to a ceasefire with the government troops.[4] After the ceasefire, the area underwent an economic boom, with both the NDAA and regional Myanmar Armed Forces (Tatmadaw) troops benefiting financially from increased opium harvests and heroin-refining.[6] The NDAA declared an opium ban in the Mongla region in 1997 and signed a new ceasefire with the Burmese government in 2011.[7]\n The NDAA maintains close ties with other rebel armed groups that split from the CPB, such as the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), the United Wa State Army (UWSA) and the New Democratic Army (Kachin) (NDA-K). In 2008 the  (UWSA) was strongly against giving away the area of Mong Pawk from its control because it serves as a link with its ally, the National Democratic Alliance Army in Mongla.[8]\n \n"], "https://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_a_secondary_camera": [" 0 Wiki User A secondary camera is either an outward or inward facing camera\nwhen both are present.

The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro was the first phone to launch with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 system-on-chip in India. It was followed by the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1, which had an even lower price tag. Now, Oppo has officially launched the Realme 1 in India. It's the first smartphone in the Realme series, and it's a lower mid-range phone. It's fair to say that competition is heating up in the budget and lower mid-range price segments in the Indian smartphone market. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro was the first phone to launch with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 system-on-chip in India. It was followed by the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1, which had an even lower price tag. Now, Oppo has officially launched the Realme 1 in India. It's the first smartphone in the Realme series, and it's a lower mid-range phone. Realme is a new Oppo sub-brand, and Realme smartphones will be exclusively available online. They will also be priced aggressively. The Realme 1 has a 6-inch Full HD+ (2160x1080) IPS display, the MediaTek Helio P60 SoC, and a 13MP rear camera. Its pricing starts at Rs. 8990 ($132) for the 3GB RAM/32GB storage variant -- undercutting all of its competitors. Let's take a look at the Realme 1's specifications: Oppo Realme 1 Specifications Dimensions and weight 156.5 x 75.2 x 7.8 mm, 158g Software ColorOS 5.0 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo CPU Octa-core MediaTek Helio P60 (4x 2GHz ARM Cortex-A73 cores + 4x 2GHz ARM Cortex-A53 cores) GPU Mali G72MP3 RAM and storage 3GB of RAM with 32GB of storage / 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage / 6GB of RAM with 128GB of storage; dedicated microSD card slot Battery 3410mAh Display 6-inch Full HD+ (2160x1080) IPS LCD with an 18:9 aspect ratio Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n Bluetooth Bluetooth 4.2 Ports microUSB port, dual nano SIM slots, VoLTE, 3.5mm headphone jack Bands GSM: 850/900/1800/1900MHzWCDMA: 850/900/2100MHzFDD-LTE: Bands 1/3/5/8TDD-LTE: Bands 38/40/41 Rear camera 13MP camera with f/2.2 aperture Front-facing camera 8MP front-facing camera with f/2.2 aperture The Oppo Realme 1's design is similar to the Oppo F7, which was launched in March. It features the same reflective back with fiberglass (which is fiber-reinforced plastic). The phone uses onscreen buttons for navigation.\u00a0Strangely,\u00a0it does not have a fingerprint sensor. Instead, it relies on AI-assisted Face Unlock for unlocking the phone, which is said to unlock the phone in less than 0.1 seconds. Face unlock is software-based, so users won't be able to use it to authenticate purchases. This means that the omission of the fingerprint sensor is a major drawback. The phone is powered by the MediaTek Helio P60 system-on-chip. This is the flagship chip in the Helio P series, and it's manufactured on a 12nm FinFET process. It features four ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.0GHz along with four ARM Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 2.0GHz, paired with the Mali-G72MP3 GPU. The SoC has support for NeuroPilot, MediaTek's AI technology. It has a 2-core mobile APU (Artificial Intelligence Processing Unit) dedicated for AI tasks. On paper, the SoC's performance should be better than that of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636. It's also a substantial leap ahead of all previous Helio P series chips. The Realme 1 has three RAM and storage configurations, although only two variants will be available at the beginning. It has 3GB of RAM with 32GB of storage, 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage, or 6GB of RAM with 128GB of storage. The 4GB RAM variant will be available at a later stage. All variants have a dedicated microSD card slot, instead of using a hybrid SIM/microSD slot. Thanks to the triple slot, users can use two SIM cards and a microSD card at the same time. The phone's display is a 6-inch Full HD+ (2160x1080) IPS LCD. Unlike the Oppo F7, it doesn't have a notch. The Realme 1 has a 13MP rear camera with an f/2.2 aperture, and an 8MP front-facing camera with f/2.2 aperture. It's powered by a 3410mAh battery with 5V/2A charging. The phone has \"AI Battery Management,\" a feature that learns users' usage habits and shuts down background apps to lower power consumption. It has the usual connectivity options including a microUSB port, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It ships with ColorOS 5.0 (Oppo's custom UI) with an exclusive and unique theme \"designed for India\" on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. The 3GB RAM/32GB storage variant of the Realme 1 costs Rs. 8990 ($132). The 4GB RAM/64GB variant will be available later for Rs. 10,990 ($162), while the top-end 6GB RAM/128GB storage variant costs Rs. 13,990 ($206). The phone's pricing is significantly cheaper than the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (which now starts at Rs. 14,999 for the 4GB RAM/64GB storage variant), and it manages to undercut the Asus ZenFone Max Pro as well (which starts at Rs. 11,999 for the 3GB RAM/32GB storage variant). The Realme 1 will be available in Diamond Black and Solar Red colors. The first sale for the 3GB RAM/32GB storage and 6GB RAM/128GB storage variants of the Realme 1 will be held on Amazon India at 12PM on May 25th. The phone will be exclusively available via Amazon. Launch offers include benefits worth \"Rs. 4850\" for Jio subscribers and a 5 percent cashback for SBI cards. A free case and screen protector will be bundled in the box. Let us know your thoughts about the Realme 1 in the comments below. "], "https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/best-full-view-display-phones/": [" Market forces made us endure screens interrupted with various sorts of notches and cutouts for a considerable time, but that\u2019s all about to end soon. In the last few years, we have seen the Android community evolve from hating notches to being indifferent towards them. But living with the new wave of bezel-less, full-view display phones has convinced us that the world is better off without notches and it\u2019s imperative that natural order be restored to our phone screens. (\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u095d\u093f\u090f) For now, most of the true full-view and notch-less display phones use Pop-up cameras or sliders, but a few tech giants including Samsung, Oppo, and Xiaomi have already demonstrated prototypes or released phones that place the front camera behind the screen. So, if you are looking for a phone without a notch or with a screen that extends edge to edge, we have listed the best options you may consider. For the sake of clarity, the list has been segregated into three segments \u2013 Premium phones, Mid-range phones, and Affordable phones. In this segment, we have listed phones that cost around Rs. 40,000 or more.  Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G is the world\u2019s first commercially available phone with an under-display camera (UDC). The main screen of this foldable phone is a 7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel with a 22.5:18 aspect ratio, QXGA+ (2208 x 1768) resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and 374ppi. Thanks to that UDC, you get a 88.57 % screen to body ratio. In our review of the device, we found the UDC to be discreet most of the time and is only evident in certain colored backgrounds and when you view it from an off-axis. However, it id definitely an engineering marvel and cool from a visual standpoint. Also, on the front, there is a 6.2-inch 120Hz FHD+ cover screen with a narrow aspect ratio. Rest, the device runs on a Snapdragon 888 chipset, 12GB LPDDR5 RAM, 256/512GB UFS 3.1 storage, 4400mAh with 25W fast charging, and a penta-camera setup.  Xiaomi\u2019s Mi Mix 4 is yet another under-screen camera phone. It calls its implementation CUP (Camera Under Panel), but the mechanism is pretty much the same as the other under-display selfie cameras out there. Above its 20MP selfie camera lies 400ppi pixels of the screen. This display stretches 6.67-inches and sports 120Hz refresh rate. It ships with Snapdragon 888+ processor, 8GB/12GB RAM, 128GB/512GB storage, 4,500mAh battery and has 120W wired charging, 108MP camera, and Harman/Kardon speakers. ALSO READ: Best Foldable and Rollable Phones in 2021  Asus Zenfone 8 Flip has a 6.67-inch (2400 \u00d7 1080 pixels) Full HD+ E4 AMOLED HDR10+ display with 90Hz refresh rate, 200Hz touch sampling rate, 110% DCI-P3 color coverage, up to 1000 nits brightness, and Corning Gorilla Glass 6 protection. This full screen fascia is possible thanks to a flip camera module. The company claims this motorized thingy has been certified to withstand up to 300,000 \u201cflips\u201d. The rest of the repertoire includes Snapdragon 888, 8GB LPDDR5 RAM + 128GB / 256GB (UFS 3.1) storage, a 5000mAh battery with 30W fast charging, etc. Asus Zenfone 8 Flip price and specs  Legion Duel 2 is a gaming smartphone from Lenovo that\u2019s envisioned to be used in landscape orientation primarily. The screen is a 6.92-inch Full HD+ AMOLED panel with 144Hz refresh rate, 1300 nits peak brightness, 111.1% DCI-P3 color gamut support, and 20.5:9 aspect ratio. The front camera is present within a pop-up camera that raises from the right-hand edge of the phone. The logic is to allow players to stream their gameplay while playing in the horizontal orientation. Other goodies in the bag are Snapdragon 888 SoC, a 64MP dual rear camera setup and 5,500mAh battery with up to 90W wired charging solution. OnePlus was one of the first few Android OEMs to usher in a notch, and it\u2019s also one of the first in the premium segment to get rid with OnePlus 7 Pro (review). It further continued the trend with OnePlus 7T Pro which comes with a\u00a0gorgeous true full-view display with extremely narrow bezels. The 90Hz refresh rate makes it super smooth, the resolution goes all the way up to 2K, and, there are those slick curves at the edges. The phone is powered by Snapdragon 855 octa-core chipset paired with high-quality UFS 3.1 storage and LPDDR4X RAM. On the downside, the 7 Pro is big and bulky, is missing the audio jack, and has a mediocre set of cameras. Other OnePlus phones with a full-view display are: What truly makes Oppo Reno 10X Zoom special\u00a0is periscope-style 5X optical Zoom, that it offers at a significantly lower price than Huawei P30 Pro. The Reno 10X zoom (review) also has a unique take on pop-up camera that it calls shark fin design.  The elevating module opens like a fin and also makes room for the earpiece and LED flash. Anyway, the result is an immersive full-view AMOLED display that extends edge to edge. The Reno 10X Zoom has flagship-grade specs, including the Snapdragon 855, but all the tech housed within makes it a tad thick and heavy. The Galaxy A80 is the only phone from Samsung with an AMOLED screen that extends edge to edge. Yes, even the high-end S-series and Note-series flagships rely on cutouts or punch holes to accommodate the front camera.  The Galaxy A80 implements the bezel-less, full-view screen using an elevating and swivel camera system. Thus the triple rear cameras also double as front selfie shooters. Perhaps this unnecessarily complicated design can be held responsible for disproportionately inflating the price. So, if you really consider an immersive full-view AMOLED screen from Samsung a top priority, you may consider the Snapdragon 730-powered Galaxy A80. In the mid-range segment, we have listed phones with retail prices ranging between Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 40,000.  The 6Z (globally known as the Zenfone 6) is one of the most impressive phones we have seen from Asus in India. The 6Z (review) has a gorgeous and well-calibrated IPS LCD display that covers the entire facia. The selfie camera is housed in a flip module and this glass body phone houses a massive 5000mAh battery while being reasonably manageable. The 6.4-inch screen has Full HD resolution which is quite sharp considering this is an IPS LCD and not AMOLED screen. This competitively priced Snapdragon 855-powered phone also has stereo speakers, 48MP primary camera, and runs an extremely close-to-stock version of Zen UI. Xiaomi\u2019s Redmi K20 Pro (review) brandishes an impressive set of specs that you\u2019d otherwise find on phones priced significantly higher. With the K20 Pro, Xiaomi pays due attention to design and the phone gets a full-view AMOLED display (6.4-inch, full HD+) with an in-display fingerprint sensor lying underneath.  As is the case with most other Xiaomi phones, the K20 Pro is a great value proposition. Key features include triple rear cameras, 4000mAh battery with fast charging support, and MIUI 10 interface with fewer ads. ALSO READ: Top Five Selfie Sticks with Tripod Stand to Buy Oppo Reno, which is a trimmed-down version of the Oppo Reno 10X Zoom, has the same design with shark-fin pop-up and is also slimmer and significantly lighter. The handset has a 6.4-inch AMOLED display (Full HD) with around 87% screen-to-body ratio that targets DCI-P3 color gamut and is shielded by Gorilla Glass variant.  This one is missing 10X lossless zoom and Snapdragon 855, but the 48MP primary rear camera and SD 710 chipset should still be a good deal for light and moderate user. In the affordable section, we have listed phones that cost under Rs. 25,000.  Motorola One Fusion Plus rocks a 6.5-inch full HD+ notch-less TFT-LCD screen. It\u2019s pop-up camera houses a 16MP sensor. Pivot and by the back you get a 64MP quartet. The phone is powered by Snapdragon 730G with 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, and a 5000mAh battery. There is support for 15W fast charging. There is Vanilla Stock Android software too in the mix. The Realme X (review) is a very competent phone that includes trendy features like a full-view AMOLED screen with minimal bezels on three sides, in-display fingerprint sensor, and pop-up camera \u2013 all for a sub Rs. 20,000 price.

A household whose historical past has been in public life for nearly a 100 years. Your maternal grandfather, your grandfather have been typically president of the Congress and typically have been within the Constituent Meeting. In a method, you come from the background of a household whose ancestors have been in public life. Particularly, they\u2019ve been energetic within the Congress and typically with the Khilafat Motion.\u201d Subsequently, Modi took a dig at Ansari who was an Indian International Service (IFS) officer earlier than he joined politics. Modi mentioned, \u201cYour individual life has been a profession diplomat. I understood what a profession diplomat is barely after turning into PM.

Piano parts are not dipped in some magically smooth plastic coating and come out looking this way. Achieving the perfect piano black is an exacting process. Just like a mirror, the piano reveals any and all slight imperfections. The reflective qualities are a testimony to not only innovation but manufacturing prowess.  As I\u2019ve had opportunity to visit some piano factories, I\u2019ve learned that piano finishes are not as much about applying the perfect finish in a dust free environment but more about levelling and polishing the black polyurethane finish to perfection. If you\u2019re interested in how they do that, here are the basic steps in making perfect piano black: 1. Smooth substrate construction\n\u201cSubstrate\u201d refers to what\u2019s underneath the finish. The first step in achieving a perfectly smooth finish is to have perfectly smooth wooden parts. All pianos must have some sort of wood substrate construction that is perfectly smooth (either medium density fiberboard or laminated layers of wood for  strength but also to prevent warping). Planing and sanding is done with precision. After all, the black finish is merely a coating over top of raw wood. If there are grooves, gouges, scratches or scrapes, they will be easily seen by the mirror finish when completed.  2. Sprayed layers of polyurethane:\nUsing a spray gun, primer coats (preparation layers for top coat layers) and polyurethane (black shiny coating) are sprayed. Multiple layers are sprayed in succession and with each layer, the finish gets thicker and thicker. One would think that if you\u2019re spraying a shiny finish that the process would be done but at this stage, it\u2019s hardly considered anywhere close to completed. These sprayed layers accomplish merely the build up of material which will have most it sanded off.  \n3. Levelling the layers There is a big difference between shiny sprayed finish and a levelled finish that has been polished. Shiny simply means that there is reflective sheen in the finish. When a piano has been sprayed, it is definitely shiny but it is also textured. Spraying a finish in a dust free, properly ventilated room still does not make a perfect finish. You can get decent finishes but not perfect finishes \u201cstraight out of the gun\u201d meaning that it\u2019s left as-is when the spraying is completed. The automotive industry robotically sprays car finishes that are so good \u201cout of the gun\u201d that most are left that way. It\u2019s pragmatic when millions of cars are being manufactured annually. The piano industry however is held to a much higher standard. When you look up close to a surface that has been sprayed, there are anomalies from the spraying application and drying process known as orange peel (which looks rippled like an orange). Against the light, this ripple effect blurs the mirror quality. The process for pianos has only begun. It now must be made level. \nWhat\u2019s the difference between shiny and level? A sprayed \u201cout of the gun\u201d finish will be shiny but not smooth like a mirror. The only way to reflect light perfectly is to level or sand the finish until all of the layers are smooth. Ironically, this means sanding the polyurethane to a dull gray. The reason? It all has to do with light reflection. If the finish is smooth and flat, the subsequent finish will reflect perfectly. But the sheen must be taken down first and be made level before polishing can begin.  \nSanding is the removal of material until the surface has become a dull gray. To be able to cut the finish to level, several grades of paper are used. While we think of sandpaper as rough grit, finish sanding uses really soft papers.\nThe diagrams above show both side and top profiles of finishes. Successively the finish is removed until the surface is smooth. 4. Polishing  If sanding is the removal of finish, polishing then is the removal of scratches. This process has become streamlined due to advancements both in tools and the science of finishes. Giant polishing machinery has been utilised to create consistent results in many of the piano factories that produce thousands of pianos annually, but hand finishing by boutique makers still creates the same end result. The advent of orbital polishers (machinery that spins many times faster than by hand) make finishes consistent and perfect. As seen in the short videos, these processes are now done on industrial level to exacting precision. But hand sanding and polishing are still involved in corners and hard to reach places. Compounds containing slight grit are used to take the dull sheen back to shine. The combination of friction from the wheels as well as the compounds rubbing on the piano parts create the desired results. Buffing wheels are used in final stages for developing sheen. \nThe end result? A piano with beautiful reflective qualities. The finishes of today are both beautiful and durable making the piano an instrument of admiration and wonder.

This used to be a major issue with low-end Android smartphones from a few years ago.\u00a0To counter this issue, Google in 2015 introduced a feature known as adoptable storage. This feature allowed users to add a MicroSD card to the phone and format it in a way that it augments the internal memory. In this article, we attempt to learn more about the adoptable storage feature and see why the feature failed to catch on. You will also learn if you can still use the feature on a smartphone running Android 10/ Android 11 and, if it can be done, what exactly do you need to do to activate it. First things first, adoptable storage lets you use microSD cards as internal storage on Android smartphones. But what was the need for this feature, and is it even relevant today? That's what we intend to find out.\u00a0Let's start with a bit of history to really get to the crux of the matter. Around 2013-14, as Android smartphones exploded in popularity - especially in emerging markets like India, South East Asia, and China - there was a surge in demand for lower-priced, entry-level smartphones. Consumers who purchased these phones soon had to contend with a major irritant: low internal storage. If you recall, entry-level smartphones of the time only came with 4GB or 8GB of storage. With apps getting increasingly bigger in terms of file sizes, and most of these apps being installable only on the internal storage,\u00a0these phones were notorious for throwing up low internal storage warning messages.\u00a0 This prompted Google to introduce a feature called adoptable storage with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The idea seemed ingenious at the time. With a majority of these low-end phones featuring a MicroSD card slot, adoptable storage did exactly what it said. It \"adopts\" the external storage and formats it in a way that behaves like internal storage. The adoptable storage feature did come as a sigh of relief for users of low-end smartphones who were frustrated with constant \"low internal storage\" warnings. It allowed them to quite easily expand the internal storage without spending too much money. All that was needed was to format the card in a special way, and voila! They had tons of fresh, new internal storage at their disposal. The process of formatting the SD card as internal storage too wasn't very daunting for users as several low-end smartphones from this era automatically prompted users to format the card in easy steps. Upon formatting the card as internal storage, the process also migrated shared storage contents (typically mounted at /sdcard) to the newly adopted media. This step helped users free a lot of valuable space on the internal storage - thereby marking an end to those annoying internal storage message warnings. All in all, adoptable storage seemed like a godsend for people with smartphones that had low internal storage, right? Well, there was a catch! Several catches, actually. While adoptable storage did solve the issue of low internal storage for several users, some smartphone brands chose not to include this feature even on their low-end phones. One key example was that of Samsung, which right from the start chose not to implement the feature on their devices. Samsung's explanation was that using microSD cards as adoptable storage affected the overall performance of the device. They also explicitly said that the feature was only intended for use on low-end smartphones while also disabling the feature on their own low-end devices! Samsung's compatriot LG was not\u00a0too keen on joining the adoptable storage party. Brands that did support Adoptable storage on their devices included HTC (which named the feature Flex Storage), Blackberry, and Motorola. Backing from major smartphone vendors notwithstanding, the feature itself did come with inherent issues. While Samsung might have had other reasons to disable the adoptable storage feature on their devices, the company wasn't lying when it said it came with inherent performance issues. Most SD cards of the time were much slower (in terms of their read/write speed) when compared to the internal flash module. This meant that every single task that involved the adopted MicroSD card took longer to execute. And with most of the devices that had this feature already falling into the low-end category, it only made the phones slower than they already were. In essence, a solution that was intended to solve a major irritant (that of low internal storage) only ended up creating another problem (that of slower performance). The adoptable feature came with a major caveat. App developers were required to manually enable this feature on their apps using the\u00a0android:installLocation attribute. And many app developers chose not to do it - mainly because of the aforementioned performance issues. WhatsApp, for example, which was notorious for clogging the internal storage on phones with its large database files and multimedia folders, never came down to supporting adoptable storage. The very reason for the popularity of microSD cards is their portability. You can simply remove the cards and toss them around (just kidding), and put them inside another smartphone or device with ease. This was no longer possible with MicroSD cards that were formatted to behave like internal storage. To disassociate the MicroSD card to be used on another device, it had to be reformatted as a portable storage device. This meant you would need to backup all the data stored on this card elsewhere. Even worse was the fact that all the apps that were installed on the card would have to be uninstalled and reinstalled again. Then there is the question of\u00a0what happens when the MicroSD card is removed from the system without doing all these steps. \u00a0Turns out\u00a0it creates a serious problem for your apps. After all, they can no longer access their data. Since the partitions with your operating system and the information for a factory reset are still stored in the internal memory, a removed or broken SD card can't do any harm. When we removed the MicroSD card, app icons were quickly replaced by\u00a0placeholders, which were\u00a0immediately restored when reinstalled. If you lose the SD card or it has a defect, your data is lost. Since these are encrypted as the internal memory, you should not hope for data recovery.\u00a0 As\u00a0of 2021, adoptable storage is not a very sought-after feature even on low-end Android smartphones because most of them have a decent amount of internal storage already.\u00a0 For the purpose of this article, I tried several handsets running Android 10/Android 11 - only to come out disappointed. In fact, I was almost convinced that newer versions of Android do not support this feature in 2021. That was until I got hold of a smartphone from a close friend made by Indian smartphone maker Micromax. The handset, known as Micromax IN Note 1, is fairly new and was released in late 2020. It runs Android 10 and, surprisingly, supports the adoptable storage feature - in 2021! When I inserted a MicroSD card into the slot, the phone immediately prompted me to ask how I wanted to use this card. And this is what you should expect to happen when you insert a card into a phone that supports adoptable storage. As seen in the image above, the phone will warn you about the read/write speed of the card being slow once you format it accordingly.\u00a0 In case your phone does not prompt you automatically, try these steps As mentioned earlier in this article, if you want to stop using a MicroSD\u00a0card that has been formatted as internal storage, it is not a simple process as removing it directly. To do this, you will need to reformat the card as portable. Here's how you can do it on Android 10. Now that you have learned\u00a0how to format and reformat your MicroSD card to use as internal storage, I am sure most of your queries regarding this topic have been answered. And you might as well stop reading by this point. But what if you have an old smartphone lying around?\u00a0\u00a0And what if it does not support adoptable storage natively? Well, in such a situation,\u00a0there are some workarounds. However, these are very outdated and may not work well as they used to half a decade ago. The steps below are applicable\u00a0for really outdated Android versions.\u00a0 Some unhelpful smartphone manufacturers disable Android's default function to format microSD as internal memory by hiding the option from your phone. However, it's still possible to activate this using a PC, no root or special privileges are required. The exact steps vary depending on the Android version of your phone. This technique worked well with Android 6.0 Marshmallow and Android 8.0 Oreo, however, we encountered difficulties working with Android Nougat. When a MicroSD card is formatted as internal memory, apps can be fully stored on it. This means that if you download applications with a total size of 2 GB, then there should be 2 GB of space taken up on the SD card. If, however, the MicroSD card is only formatted as a backup memory, this is not the case, as PLATYPUS_DIARRHEA writes on Reddit. Just because the menu option is invisible doesn't mean that it doesn't work. A few days after the Reddit post, a command-line prompt\u00a0became known, with which you could also format MicroSD cards as internal memory on the Galaxy S7. We have successfully tested the instructions with the Samsung Galaxy S7, the Sony Xperia Z5, and the LG G4, while running Android 6.0 Marshmallow. All three smartphones run on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and have a slot for MicroSD cards. In addition, the menu option\u00a0for formatting the MicroSD card as internal memory is missing. The entry is only available on HTC One A9 and on Motorola in all Moto smartphones. Why Samsung, LG, and Sony do not show us this\u00a0menu option escapes me. I connected each of the three smartphones to the computer, and each had one MicroSD card inside. Then I typed into the ADB tools the command-line commands that Paul O'Brien described in his blog post. As soon as you have the command line window open and the smartphone connected, you can enter the first command: Now the command line is ready for you to issue system commands to your smartphone. In this case, we want to format the SD card or a part of its memory as internal memory. Even if Sony, Samsung, and LG deny us the possibility via the UI, we can still transfer the command to the smartphone as a console command. First, however, we need the ID of the SD card. You will find it with the following command: In my case, the disk is called 179.64. For you, perhaps, it is different. Note the exact identifier. In the next command, we will format and partition the MicroSD card. Your content will be deleted. If important files are on the card, copy them to another disk. If you want to keep the MicroSD card permanently in the smartphone, you can now partition all of your memory. To do this, type: The operation takes several seconds or minutes, depending on the capacity of the memory card. If you want to use a certain percentage so that it can be read by other devices, you must exclude it from the private partition. The 50:50 partitioning command looks like this: This is the end of Paul\u00a0O'Brien's guide, but not the end of the work. If you now want to use the adopted memory as such, you must also migrate apps and data. This can be done through the storage section of your Android settings menu. Tap the MicroSD card, then move to the top right of the menu and click on Move data. You cannot select this menu item before partitioning. Now, and in the future, downloaded apps are fully written to the MicroSD card. Only system apps and updates use the internal memory. This means that you should never again get error messages due to lack of space if an app update is pending. Some readers have reported difficulties when installing system updates from Android 6 after using the methods above. The update to Android 7.0 Nougat specifically doesn't seem possible with the manually partitioned MicroSD cards, as described below. Our test devices with\u00a0Android 7.0 Nougat do not even respond to the console commands shown below. In the absence of documentation on the net, we can therefore only advise you to reverse the steps described below before a system update. Back up photos or music on your computer or in the cloud and free up as much memory on the SD card and smartphone as you can. Uninstall unnecessary apps and migrate your data back into the internal memory. Then format the MicroSD card as removable media. Only then it is safe to install an Android update. We have finally come to the end of this article. Do let us know what you think of adoptable storage. Have you managed to use this feature on your phone?\u00a0 This article was heavily revised in May 2021 to reflect fresh changes. Older comments and some older steps have been retained.

Before reading this article, I never even thought about the possible performance issues of the internal SD Reader/Writer in the phone. I just bought a 1TB MicroSD card from smoother-shopping.com for less than $20 for said phone.Having dabbled in Windows-based PCs most of my life, I just figured it would be like partitioning a portion of the hard drive specifically for the Windows OS and saving and installing everything else to the secondary partition because over time the more you bog down the primary drive with the OS on it with data, although the cache/cpu knows what section of the drive possesses the data it's attempting to acquire, it still must wade through all of the other data on the drive in order to single out, import into RAM, and bring up the desired content on the screen thus \"potentially\" slowing down the whole process. I know it worked phenomenally on Windows, but then again you were allocating space on a proven performance drive NOT attempting to create a drive for the Android OS on a MicroSD with a subpar SD Reader/Writer........so NOW......in the end.......I don't know what to do because as I began to fill up my internal drive to it's capacity the slower my phone has become, but if using the SD card as internal drive isn't gonna help....then what's the point \n1\n\nRubens Eishima\n For daily tasks and storage duties, a class10/UHS-1 microSD card should be enough for most smartphones.As long as you keep the most used apps in the internal storage, and move the rest and general files to the external card, that should be ok. \n0\n\n Why not root the phone? I used to tinker with android phones in the earlier years of android phones and I know that rooting can give you the ability to install apps on the SD card even without making the SD card an extended storage for the phone. You could even move system files to SD. I am sure you can find info on this over the net. There used to be apps for such.Cant let 1TB SD card waste now, would you? \n1\n\nRubens Eishima\n I've bought a Motorola G100 that was released this year and runs Android 11. It has a slot for one SD Card which can be used as internal storage. \n0\n\n \"Format as internal\" is not an option on the Samsung A01 using Android 11. \n0\n\n As mentioned in the article, Samsung never supported adoptable storage even when the feature was new. So what you found was not surprising. \n0\n\n The manufacturer's that disabled the internal storage option did so for a few reasons. For Samsung it was a weak card reader. It was older and slow. It was never meant to be used as a full speed interface to storage. Just backup and transfer and because of this, many units that bypassed and ran even a good SD card would eventually overheat and occasionally burn the reader. I know LG did it due to issues with having to explain to consumers needing a specific rated card speed. It wasn't worth the aggravation.As for Sony, cheap reader once again, and from a company that makes fast SD cards it's better to avoid that entire situation. \n0\n\n My lg pnone does not add the space as internal memory to the internal storage but creates two sd carfs one internal and one external sd card. I foget exacly what card it is but its a 32 g sandisk ultra high speed. Can I get it to add to the internal storage. \n0\n\n why some manufactures disable this option? to let the internal flash memory wear fast and so they can sell more \n0\n\n I seem to have followed all of the steps correctly but cannot migrate data. I have an lg x power 3, android 8.1. I am showing internal 16gb, sd card 65 of 128gb (its a 64). I'm not concerned about the size being wrong as that's a common error. when I try to migrate the data the system app crashes. I can individually move apps back and forth fine. I have tried with the private and a mixed 50 option. Should I factory reset and do it first? could it be any updates that block this now? Thanks for any help. \n2\n\n\u0411\u0443\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0432 \u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439Robert Caron\n update , my storage shows as internal, internal sd, and portable storage. File manager no longer works, but ofther managers such as cx explorer do. Any apps i try to download default to the internal storage so not enough space. ( incidentally had to use the -s serial option to get adb shell to work) I have tried the adb set-installation command but gets the 2000 error and apparently as is not rooted cant use su. \n0\n\n I have done this on my LG K4 (model m151) using a sandiskextreme pro 32 g sd and it seams to be working okay. Notice a little bit of a lag but only a few seconds \n0\n\n Galaxy J7 V running Android 9: after running sm partition (...), sm list-volumes says that the newly created private volume is unmountable. Tried again with same results. Restarted phone several times. Card no longer appears in settings app. Any suggestions? \n0\n\n guys if u root ur device then there's no issues with the storage and moving data \n0\n\n Billqs I get the same kind of problem with the Migrate Data selection (which I assume is the same as the \"move data\" they referred to. I get \"settings has crashed\" as well. Mine is Oreo as well. \n0\n\n On a KEY2 running 8.1, no matter what I do seems to generate: Error: java.lang.IllegalStateException: command '111 volume partition disk:179,64 private' failed with '400 111 Command failed' \n0\n\n I just tried this with an LG V30 I just picked up to use as a DAP. I put in a 128G SD Card and the phone has 128G internal. After doing the above, the internal storage reads as 256G, but when I go to \"Migrate Data\" I keep getting an error message telling me that \"Settings has crashed\". Does anyone know why? I am using Oreo. I don't know if it's some sort of protection LG put in or what? \n0\n\n mobile should need to be rooted \n0\n\n Hi I have a 32 gb sd chip and my phone is a cheap prestige 2 zte with little to no space to handle much access outside of the basic call text and repeat. My question is of much importance to me and if any tech or android sauva/knowledgeable person could kindly break this down for me or dumb it down, I installed my chip 32 gb the device recognizes it so I now and faced with \"just having it in my phone\" or \"formatting as internal\" < kinda scares me. I just wanna throw my photos from from the deivce on it so not to lose any. Also gives me an option to just formatting it. I want to be able to move my photos, documents from my phone to the card and from the card to my harddrive etc. IF I FORMAT AS INTERNAL,? A. what does that incline. B. will I be able to do what I want? and C.If so or not Once Formatted to my device / phone can I clean or reset it to be able to use the SD one perhaps a newer phone later on when I upgrade my device? Please guide me to my answer oh and I dont wanna break this chip so any other advice would rule thanks and please help \n0\n\n Umm what about Android 8.1 I'm using my Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 and can't move internal applications to external (Update plss) \n0\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nSignup to continue\n It only takes a moment to join the community! \n\nSignup to comment\n It only takes a moment to join the conversation!

May 24, 2022\n By Sara Delheimer, Program Coordinator, Multistate Research Fund Impacts Program. This article was originally published by the Multistate Research Fund Impacts Program. It is reprinted here with permission.\u00a0\u00a0 Innovations in nanotechnology can help safeguard food security and protect the public from pathogens in food, water and the environment. With support from USDA\u2019s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA), researchers at Land-grant Universities are working together to develop nanotechnology that can be used to detect pathogens, develop vaccines, target drug delivery, create antimicrobial packaging, purify water, combat antimicrobial resistance and more. Education facilitates the development and use of nanotechnology, and partnerships with industry are making these technologies broadly available.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \nResearch Highlights\u00a0\nResearchers developed nanoscale sensors that detect pathogens, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants in food, water and soil. Many of these tools are smartphone-based, easier to use, faster, more sensitive, and more affordable than previous methods, and many have been adopted. The following universities are involved in this work:\u00a0 Researchers created tools that make nanoscale sensors easier to use. For example, University of Georgia researchers used nanotechnologies to fabricate food quality sensors that stay operational longer. University of Hawaii scientists designed an inexpensive portable instrument that can connect to several types of electrochemical sensors to analyze food and environmental samples. Researchers also developed an Android app that can connect to and control sensors via Bluetooth. The open-source app allows customized data acquisition and visualization, helping users get more information out of sensors.\u00a0 Newly developed nanomaterials remove contaminants. For example, University of Kentucky scientists developed nanocomposite membranes that remove PFAS, a common carcinogenic pollutant, from drinking water. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin created a reusable nanomaterial that adheres to and removes heavy metals from water. University of Connecticut scientists developed nanomaterials that control microbes and chemicals in wastewater recycled for irrigation. Cornell University researchers produced nanofibers that capture chemicals and pathogens from liquids. Researchers are using nanoparticles in vaccines and disease treatments. For example, Clemson University scientists developed nanoparticles that bind to and kill pathogens before they infect host cells, and University of Wisconsin scientists developed nanofiber-coated capsules to detect and entrap bacteria that cause urinary tract infections. At Virginia Tech, researchers constructed a nanoparticle that could be used in a vaccine against a highly transmissible and deadly disease in pigs.\u00a0\u00a0 Scientists are developing antimicrobial films and packaging with nanoparticles. For example, University of Missouri scientists developed eco-friendly methods for fabricating silver nanoparticles that act as antimicrobials. Scientists at the University of Florida, Michigan State University and Rutgers University are also developing antimicrobial nanomaterials.\u00a0\u00a0 Understanding the potential risks of nanomaterials will help make policy decisions related to their manufacturing and use. Scientists at the University of Florida, University of Kentucky and University of Wisconsin are studying the human and environmental health effects of nanotechnology used in food, agricultural, and biological systems. University of Kentucky researchers were among the first to examine and show multigenerational effects from exposure to silver nanomaterials.\u00a0\u00a0 Project members established industry and government partnerships that guide, fund, and speed up the development, commercialization, and adoption of nanotechnologies. For example, Michigan State University has an agreement with a food company to validate and potentially license a nanosensor. Tucson Water is using University of Arizona sensors to detect norovirus and PFAS in drinking water.\u00a0 Project members are disseminating nanotechnology knowledge and techniques. They develop and share educational and training materials in journals, workshops, conferences, and other outlets and are active in the Global Alliance for Rapid Diagnostics, which fosters institutional partnerships, forums and short courses on nanotechnology and biosensors. Publications by project members are widely cited and downloaded. Project members are also reaching wider audiences through popular outlets, like TED talks and news stories.\u00a0\u00a0 Project members are training students and scientists worldwide, encouraging future innovations and leadership in nanotechnology. Project members and their students have received numerous awards for their work. This recognition has facilitated new projects and stronger collaborations.\u00a0\u00a0 The nanotechnologies developed by project members have applications far beyond food and agriculture.\u00a0\u00a0 An interdisciplinary team at Michigan State University developed nanoparticles that can be embedded and traced to verify product authenticity. This helps prevent counterfeiting.\u00a0\u00a0 University of Wisconsin scientists developed a method for using nanoparticles to detect explosive compounds.\u00a0\u00a0 University of Kentucky scientists are studying nanomaterials that can fight antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae bacteria, which cause infections, especially in hospitals and among older and immunocompromised patients.\u00a0\u00a0 A sensor developed by scientists at the University of Arizona and Michigan State University can detect COVID-19 in water, air and saliva samples.\u00a0\u00a0 University of Arizona scientists developed nanotechnology that can classify the type of oil in samples from oil spills in seawater.\u00a0\u00a0 Nanomaterials created by University of Florida scientists enhance the efficiency of solar cells that convert sunlight into electricity.\u00a0 This project is supported in part by NIFA\u2019s Hatch Multistate Research Fund and by grants to project members at participating institutions: University of Arizona, University of Arkansas, Clemson University, University of Connecticut, Cornell University, University of Florida, University of Georgia, University of Hawaii, University of Illinois, Iowa State University, University of Kentucky, Louisiana State University, Michigan State University, University of Minnesota, University of Missouri, South Dakota State University, Utah State University, and University of Wisconsin.

Sharps (#\u2019s) and flats (b\u2019s) are identified using the black keys. When a note is described as \u201csharp\u2019 or \u201cflat.\u201d it should be played in the next higher and flat in the lower key. A black key to the right of (or higher than) a white key is sharp. A black key to the left of (or lower than) a white key is flat. The flat () modifier lowers or shifts the pitch to the left. As a result, the black key to the left of D is changed to D. The black key between C and D is referred to as either C or D. Because C and D are two names for the same note, they are enharmonic equivalents. On a normal 88-key piano, there are 36 black keys (upright or grand pianos). There are 25 keys on a 61 -key instrument (often a keyboard). The number of black keys on a piano might vary depending on which is the opening note, but below is a general guide. Fifty-two white keys and 36 black keys make up an 88-key acoustic or digital piano. For almost a century, this has been the standard for pianos. There are. of course, always exceptions. There\u2019s even a piano with 102 keys on the market! Nevertheless, the 88-key layout appears to be a fair mix between range and usability. An 88-key keyboard, for example, may still be transported. Consider how a keyboard would look without the black keys to understand its purpose better. It\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s no way to tell one note from the next at a look. Every other message on black keys isn\u2019t any better. Finally, we have our current design. Three followed by 2 allows for visual differentiation and a total of 12 notes on a scale! In reality, intermediate and expert pianists memorize note names by positioning the black keys. So. what\u2019s the purpose of the black keys on a piano? They use a recognized design to organize the 12 keys per octave.  Expert Tip: Sharps (#\u2019s) and flats (b\u2019s) are identified using the black keys. When a note is described as \u201csharp\u2019 or \u201cflat,\u201d it should be played in the next higher and flat in the lower key. Thus, a black key is sharp to the right of (or higher than) a white key. A black key to the left of (or lower than) a white key is flat  The black keys exist to keep the white notes from overlapping in a consecutive sequence. This not only helps you distinguish between an A and a C, but it also tells you what octave range you\u2019re in. Ebony, a thick dark wood with a beautiful sheen, was historically used to make black keys. Traditionally, white keys were made of plated ivory derived from tusks (such as elephant tusks). Ebony, a hardwood, was used to make the black keys on traditional pianos. In most modem keyboards, the keys are capped with high-quality plastic. How can one tell if the keys on my piano are ivory or plastic? Longer keys were traditionally played more frequently than shorter keys; therefore, they were usually coated with strips of ivory, which is a hard-wearing material. As a result, the more ephemeral keys were not as often used As a result, they were fashioned of basic dark woods like sugar pine, spruce, or basswood, which were dubbed \u2018black notes.\u2019 Many people still call them \u201civories.\u201d However, in the 1970s. the piano industry abandoned ivory as a key material, which wasn\u2019t all that long ago. was it? Assuming your piano was built before this time, a few indicators indicate that the keys are ivory. Unfortunately, manufacturers attempt to duplicate these features, so it\u2019s not always so straightforward. Most piano keys are now made of plastic since they are simple, inexpensive, and long-lasting. Yamaha even created and manufactured a material called \u2018Ivorite\u2019 that looks and feels like ivory. A hard nut species are gaining popularity as a substitute for ivory. The tagua nut. sometimes known as vegetable ivory, is the seed of the ivory nut palm, endemic to South America and Africa. Unfortunately, because of its small size (usually 4-8cm in diameter), the possibilities for what it may be used for are limited. Sharps and flats are represented by the black keys (accidentals). You\u2019ll see that they\u2019re sandwiched between two white keys, such as C and D. A half stride between them would be the black key in between them. So even though it is the same note, it is a half step higher from C. called C#. or a half step down from D. called Db. When the same tone or interval is written differently, it is referred to as an enharmonic equivalent. It\u2019s worth noting that the black key between C and D is referred to as either C or D. Because they are two names for the same note. C and D are enharmonic equivalents. So. what are the names of the black keys of a piano? D. E. G. A. B. or C. D. F. G. A. B. are the names of the black keys.  Expert Tip: There are five black keys and seven white keys on the keyboard. When you double a frequency, you get an octave higher pitch. Similarly, plucking two strings, one half the length of the other, results in two sounds octave apart.  An octave was divided into the twelve semitones that westerners were acquainted with when music originated in Europe. However, some civilizations divide the octave in different ways. For example. Drupal. an ancient North Indian form of music, divided the octave into 84 parts. Equal temperament tuning is used on modern pianos and keyboard instruments, in which each note is 122 times higher than the note preceding it There is no need for additional keys or sophisticated tuning mechanisms as a result of this. Even though keys do not have colors, in theory, the keyboard has two colors: black and white, which all notes adjust to. As a result, black keys are just that: black keys. So Db (also written C#) is what we\u2019re talking about. A-Sharp (B-Flat). B. B-Flat. B-Flat B-Flat. B-Flat. B-Flat. B-Flat, B- F Many novices believe that a sharp or flat key defines a black key. For example Sharps and flats are black keys; however, not all black keys are sharps or flats. The sharp and flat keys of the piano are sometimes known as the black keys. Sharps and flats are what you\u2019re looking for if you see a note written like this: C# or A. The sharp is denoted by a \u2018#.\u2019 whereas the flat is represented by a Each black note is a semitone higher or lower than its corresponding white key. As an example\u2026 We obtain a sharp \u2018D#\u2019 if we take the \u2018D\u2019 white note and shift it to the black one above it. Likewise, we obtain \u2018D\u2019 if we shift down a semitone to the black note below D. Spend some time memorizing the names of the black keys and try if you can tell the difference in pitch between them and their white counterparts. First, let\u2019s concentrate on going from Middle C to the right. C sharp (C#) is the black key directly to the right. This is a half-step higher than C. You\u2019ll be atD if you take another half stride. The sharps are C#. D#. F# G#. and A#, in sequence from Middle C to the right. B# and E# are C and F. respectively, despite the former being rarely used. Always keep in mind that sharps are located on the right side of a note. Each black key serves as a sharp and a flat at the same time. An alert is a half-step higher than the white key it corresponds to. whereas flats are lower. Return to Middle C and turn left this time. B flat is the first black key (Bb). Bb. Ab. Gb. Eb. and Db are the flats in ascending sequence from Middle C. Cb. and Fb is B and E. respectively. However, this isn\u2019t how they\u2019re normally written. Flats are always on the note\u2019s left side. The first lesson in learning to play the piano is, these are the white keys, and these are the black keys. Let\u2019s focus on the black keys. How many black keys does a piano have? This is the question that will be answered.  Expert Tip: The traditional piano has thirty-six black keys. The black keys are known as sharp or flat. Thirty-six black keys have been the standard for more than 100 years on a piano, so whether it be a traditional, contemporary, digital, or keyboard the answer is the same.  The B\u00f6sendorfer Imperial piano is the exception to the rule. This piano has 9 more keys than any other average piano. These extra keys are located on the left side of the piano on the end. These keys are colored black to tell the difference between the original 88 keys from the extra 9. They are used to give a richer. sound. The black keys on a piano are called sharp and flat keys. These key produce a sound that is a half of a note higher or lower than the natural notes, or white keys, next to them. The flat keys make a pitch that is half of a note higher than its corresponding natural note, where the sharp keys make pitches that are half a note higher than the corresponding natural note. Black keys with a higher pitch, the sharp keys, are on the right hand side of a given natural note, where the lower pitched black keys, also known as the flats, are on the left hand side of the given natural note. There are a total of 36 black keys on a standard piano comprising of both sharp and flat keys. For every 7 white keys on a contemporary piano there are 5 black keys; this comprises an octave. You should now be familiar with the names of the black keys, their history and evolution on the piano, and the many ways they are utilized in music. From here, we propose developing your own black key improvisation activities, ensuring that you have a thorough understanding of all piano notes (not just the black keys) And here\u2019s a similar post for novice pianists: Good luck with your practice!

He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi.

He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. He left home after graduating from school, partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected. Modi travelled around India for two years and visited a number of religious centres. He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[a]or otherwise criticised for its handling of it, however a Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings.[b]His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise.[8]His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education indices in the state.[c]Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election, which gave the party a majority in the Lok Sabha, the first time a single party had achieved this since 1984. Modi himself was elected to parliament from Varanasi. Since taking office, Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, increased spending on infrastructure, and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy, and centralised power by abolishing the planning commission and replacing it with the NITI Aayog. He has begun a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Credited with engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.[d]Early life and educationNarendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c.1915 \u2013 1989) and Hiraben Modi (born c.1920).[17]Modi's family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community,[18][19][20]which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government.[21][22]As a child, Modi helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station and later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus.[23][24]Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, with interest in theatre.[25]Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and his teachers and students noted this.[26]Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.[27][28]When eight years old, Modi discovered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) for RSS and became his political mentor.[29]While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sanghleaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980.[30]Engaged while still a child to Jashodaben, a girl from a family who lived close by, Modi rejected the arranged marriage at the same time he graduated from high school.[31]The resulting familial tensions contributed to his decision to leave home in 1967.[32]Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he went have emerged.[33]In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almoraand the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education.[34][35][36]Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi's life.[37]In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which Modi wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati.[38]Modi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968\u201369.[39]Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad.[40]There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.[41][42]In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city.[43][44][45]After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS,[42]working under Inamdar.[46]Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him.[46]Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001.[47]In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Artsdegree in political science from School of Open Learning[48]at University of Delhi,[49][50]graduating with a third class.[51]Five years later, in 1983, he received a Master of Artsdegree in political science from Gujarat University,[52][53]as an external distance learning student.[54]Early political careerIn June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhideclared a state of emergency in India which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as \"The Emergency\", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.[55][56]Modi was appointed general secretary of the \"Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\", an RSS committee coordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.[57]Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.[58][59]Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.[60]During this period, Modi wrote a book in Gujarati, Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In The Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency.[61][62]Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes, as well as several other national political figures.[63]In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a Sikh.[60]Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak(regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency.[64]He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985.[30]In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers.[65]After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.[66]Modi rose within the party and was named a member of the BJP's National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise L. K. Advani's 1990 Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991\u201392 Ekta Yatra(Journey for Unity).[25][67][68]However, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in Ahmedabad; friction with Shankersingh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played a part in this decision.[68]Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani, and as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly elections.[68][30][69][70]In November of that year Modi was elected BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.[69][71]The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections.[25]Modi, on the selection committee for the 1998 Assembly elections in Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as key to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections,[69][72]and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year.[73]Chief Minister of GujaratTaking officeIn 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.[69][74][75]The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement.[25]Although BJP leader L. K. Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was \"going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all\". On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections.[76]On 7 October 2001, Modi was administered the oath of office.[77]On 24 February 2002 he entered the Gujarat state legislature by winning a by-election to the Rajkot \u2013 II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC by 14,728 votes, which enabled him to take office.[78]2002 Gujarat riotsMain article: 2002 Gujarat riotsOn 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[e]The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[81][82]In making a public statement after the incident, Modi said that the attack had been terror attack planned by local Muslims.[3][81][83]The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh across the state.[84][85]Riots began during the bandh, and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.[81][84][85]The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.[81][86]The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed.[87]Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000.[81][88]Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.[89]Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women.[2]The government of Gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots,[1][2][3]and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation.[90]Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom, while others have called it an example of state terrorism.[91][92][93]Summarising academic views on the subject, Martha Nussbaum said: \"There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law.\"[2]The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating.[84][85]The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh, despite such actions being illegal at the time.[3]State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.[94]Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.[95]During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.[2][83][96]In 2012 Maya Kodnani, a minister in Modi's government from 2007 to 2009, was convicted by a lower court for participation in the Naroda Patiya massacre during the 2002 riots.[97][98]Although Modi's government had announced that it would seek the death penalty for Kodnani on appeal, it reversed its decision in 2013.[99][100]On 21 April 2018, the Gujarat High Court acquitted Kodnani while noting that there were several shortfalls in the investigation.[101]Modi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, Modi said that \"What is happening is a chain of action and reaction.\"[2]Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.[102]Modi has not offered an apology for the riots and has stated that he should be rather punished and not forgiven if he is guilty.[11][103]In March 2008, the Supreme Court reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.[90][104][105]In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri (widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre), in April 2009 the court also asked the SIT to investigate the issue of Modi's complicity in the killings.[104]The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.[104][106]In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT's position, he said that Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.[107][108]The Supreme Court gave the matter to the magistrate's court. The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jaffri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013 the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister.[109]2002 electionIn the aftermath of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.[110]Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted.[111]His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved.[112][113]Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002.[114]In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.[115]Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign,[116][117][118][119]and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters.[114]He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 1,13,589 of 1,54,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes.[120]On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term.[121]Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly.[1][116]Second termDuring Modi's second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development.[74][1][116]Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivarorganisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad(VHP),[122]entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry,[74]and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP.[122][123]Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions.[122]Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a foreword to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.[124][125]Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister)[126][127]distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.[128][129]Questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed under the aegis of the International Religious Freedom Act,[130][131]the only person denied a US visa under this law.[132]The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[133]and the EU[134]lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington.[135][136]During the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism.[137]In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \" for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings.[138]In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a \"spiritual experience\" for Valmiks, a sub-caste of Dalits.[139][140]However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct.[141]After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat's 1,600-kilometre (990 mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats.[142]In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post,[143]and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election.[144]Development projectsThe Sardar Sarovar Dam during a 2006 height increase.As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth \u20b96.6 trillion were signed.[74]The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them.[145]Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.[146]As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cottonincreased to become the largest in India.[145]The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use[147]led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007.[148]Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4\u20136% of the area intended.[145]Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent \u2013 the highest of any state.[147]However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992\u201397 INC government was 12.9 percent.[149]In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata's to Gujarat.[150]The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed.[149]Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised,[145]according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.[151]Development debateModi addressing graduates of the Gujarat National Law University in 2012.There has been a contentious debate surrounding the development of the state of Gujarat during Modi's tenure as chief minister.[152]The GDP growth rate of Gujarat averaged 10% during Modi's tenure, a value above that of the country as a whole, and similar to other highly industrialised states.[150]Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office.[153]Some scholars have stated the rate of growth did not accelerate during Modi's tenure,[153]although the state is considered to have maintained a high growth rate during Modi's Chief Ministership.[95]Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank's \"ease of doing business\" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years.[154]In 2013, Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for \"economic freedom\" by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states.[150][155]In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.[1]Tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states, as was land. Modi's policies to make Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones, where labour laws were greatly weakened.[116]Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the \"alarming\" category on the India State Hunger Index.[156][157]A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found that Gujarat under Modi had a poor record with respect to immunisation in children.[158]Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.[95]It showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined.[95]With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below most Indian states.[95]The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits, and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities.[95]Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index. Political Scientist Christophe Jaffrelotsays that under Modi the number of families below the poverty line has increased and conditions for rural adivasi and dalits, in particular, have declined.[5]Under Modi, the state government spent far less than the national average on education and healthcare.[95]In July 2013, economics Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen expressed disapproval of Modi's governance record, saying that under his administration Gujarat's \"record in education and healthcare is pretty bad\".[159]However, economists Arvind Panagariya and Jagdish Bhagwati say that Gujarat's social indicators have improved from a lower baseline than that of other Indian states. According to them, Gujarat's performance in raising literacy rates has been superior to other states and the \"rapid\" improvement of health indicators is evidence that \"its progress has not been poor by any means.\"[160]Final yearsModi with Anandiben Patel at a meeting of BJP MLAs after his election as prime minister; Patel succeeded him as Gujarat chief minister.Further information: Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, 2012During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.[116]Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.[116]He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra.[116]His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012.[116]He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji(\"Guru worthy of worship\").[161]According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.[162]While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people,[114]something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt.[163]The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure[164]and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995).[165]In later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates.[166]In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests by Indian-Americans.[167]After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014. Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister.[168] Caution: form this is an advance proof copy of an irs tax form. it is subject to change and omb approval before it is officially released. if you have any comments on this form, you can submit them to us on our web site. include the word in your...

The BJP is a national party and is the most prominent member of Sangh Pariwar family. The history and spirit of BJP can be traced back to the Bharatiya Jan Sangh. Bharatiya Jan Sangh (BJS), predecessor party of BJP, was founded in 1952 which won 3 seats in the First Loksabha Election in India and continued as a political party for 24 years. Subsequently the BJS merged into the Janata Party in 1977 and formed a coalition government. BJP was formed after the fallout of Janta Party coalition government in 1979. The man behind creating such a large party with once single objective was none other than the great visionary, scholar and leader Dr Syama Prasad Mookerji, drawing inspiration from Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya. Pandit ji was an insightful leader and guided the erstwhile BJS party from 1953 to 1968. Taking its genes from RSS and the erstwhile Bharatiya Jan Sangh, BJP is dedicated to the country\u2019s unity, integrity, its inherent uniqueness, social strength, individual character and cultural exclusivity that have been the characteristic of India. The country has seen many invasions and oppressions from external forces. It has fearlessly resisted and fought against all odds, keeping its flag of essential civilization and cultural ethos afloat. History is the evidence to Indian spirit, to the patriotism of Chatrapati Shivaji, the legacy of Kakatiya, the heroism of Maharana Pratap, Lakshmi Bai, and of Guru Govind Singh. The same spirit was carried forward by Swami Dayanand Saraswati and Swami Vivekanada in the recent past. Keeping alive the spirit, Lokmanya Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi, Sri Aurobindo, and others have made history by their simple yet powerful message of patriotism for the Mother Land. With the principle of \u201cJustice for all and appeasement of none\u201d the Sangh(RSS), founded by Dr K B Hedgewar (Doctorji) in 1925 and strengthened after 1940 by M S Golwalkar (Guruji). It believes the Hindu identity and culture as the foundation of the county. To the Sangh, all Indians, irrespective of their religion, region, caste, and creed are equal. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya was the chief of Bharatiya Jana Sangh from 1953 to 1968. He was highly committed and had been the source of inspiration for BJP since its initiation. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya was born on 25 September 1916 in the region of Brij belonging to a village of Nagla Chandraban in Mathura. Deendayalji completed his intermediate with distinction in Pilani and later passed his B.A in first class from Sanatan Dharma College in 1937. In the same year he joined RSS on request of his friend, Shri. Balwant Mahashabde. During a competitive examination held by the government, he appeared in dhoti and kurta, with a cap on his head, while others came in western suits and called him \u201cPanditji\u201d , which was used by many people with respect and love in the years followed. He topped the examination and later pursued his B.T. Upon successful completion of B.T he continued to actively take part in RSS activities and moved to Lakhimpur district in UP as an organizer. He became provincial organizer of RSS in UP in 1955. Deendayalji started a publishing house \u2018Rashtra Dharma Prakashan\u2019 in Luknow and he started a monthly magazine \u2018Rashtra Dharma\u2019. Afterwards, he introduced weekly magazine \u2018Panchjanya\u2019 and daily magazine \u2018Swadesh\u2019.He was highly influential in hosting political convention in UP and beginning the state unit of the new party, Bharatiya Jana Sangh. He organized all India convention held for the first time on 21 October 1951. His organizing skills were excellent. He became the president of Jana sangh in 1968 and later moved to south with the message of Jana Sangh. Deendayalji met with sudden death on 11 Febraury 1968, the day which left all his followers and disciples sad. Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee was born on 6 July 1901. He graduated from Calcutta University and became the fellow of the senate in 1923. In 1924 he enrolled himself as an advocate in Calcutta High court. Later on he left for England in 1926 and was admitted as a barrister from Lincoln\u2019s Inn in 1927. Dr Mookerjee became the youngest Vice-Chancellor at the University of Calcutta and was in the position till 1938. During his term period he introduced many constructive reforms and actively took part in Asiatic Society and he was also a member of Court and the Council of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore and chair person of Inter-University of Board. Pandit Nehru admitted him as Industry and supply minister during the interim government. Bharatiya Jana Sangh was established by him on 21 October 1951. Later on he formed the NDA government as an alliance of 32 Lok Sabha MPs and 10 Rajya Sabha MPs. Dr. Mookerjee worked hard for the cause of unifying Jammu and Kashmir with the remaining India. Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Ram Rajya Parishad and Hindu Mahasabha have initiated Satyagraha with intent to remove destructive provisions of the Article 370. Mookerjee visited Kashmir in 1953 and was arrested on 11 May 1953 for violating notorious Permit System. He passed away on 23 June 1953.

Kushabhau Thakre was known for his leadership qualities and had the quality of inspiring people and building a team of highly committed workers. He encouraged others to act in forefront guiding them from backdrop. K. Jana Krishnamurthy is an Indian politician who was born on 24 May 1928, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. In 2001, he rose to be the president of Bharatiya Janata Party. Krishnamurthy is a former Union Law Minister and a member of Indian parliament. He was the second person from Tamil Nadu after Kamaraj to lead a national party in India. Being an active member of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Krishnamurthy was elected as the Bharatiya Jana Sangh\u2019s General Secretary in Tamil Nadu. He stood one among the founders of Bharathiya Janata Party (BJP) along with Lal Krishna Advani, Kushabhau Thakre, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, SS Bhandari and Jaganatha Rao Joshi. During the period of 1980 to 1990, he aided the BJP to expand in four Southern states which include Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka. He was the member of Rajya Sabha from Gujarat state. He was also elected as the Petitions Committee\u2019s chairman. Bangaru Laxman was a member of Bharatiya Janata Party and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He was President of the party from 2000-2001 and served as a minister of state for railways in Indian Government from 1999 to 2000. Laxman joined the politics at very early age. He was the first dalit to be elected as the president of BJP. He was the member of Legislative Council of Andhra Pradesh from 1980-85 and Rajya Sabha member on behalf of Gujarat from 1996 to 2002. He served as a state minister for Planning, Statistics and Program Implementation from October to November 1999 and as railway minister from November 1999- August 2000. Bangaru Laxman joined RSS at a tender age of 12 years and later became the most active member of Jan Sangh Party in 1969. He served in the Electricity department in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s government in 1958. Bangaru Lakshman passed away on 1 March 2014 in Hyderabad due to severe health problem. Shri Rajnath Singh is a famous Indian politician who is presently working as the Union Minister of Home Affairs in the administration of Narendra Modi. He is also the President of the ruling party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Earlier he was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and Cabinet Minister during the period of Vajpayee Government. He was born on 10 July 1951 and at the age of 24 he was appointed as the District President of the Jana Sangh. In 1977 he was selected as a Member of Legislative Assembly from the Mirzapur constituency. Under the first BJP government he became the Education Minister in the state of Uttar Pradesh in 1991. He was selected into the Rajya Sabha in 1994 and he became involved with the Advisory committee on Industry (1994\u201396), Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Agriculture, Business Advisory Committee, House Committee and the Committee on Human Resource Development. He became the President of the BJP\u2019s Uttar Pradesh unit in on 25 March 1997 and in became the Union Cabinet Minister for Surface Transport in 1999. He became Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2000 and performed many welfare activities for the people during his tenure period. After that he was re-elected as the BJP\u2019s National President on 24 January 2013 and participated in 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Lucknow constituency and was elected as a Member of the Indian Parliament. Amit Shah is the President of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), succeeding Rajnath Singh. He is a distinguished political leader in the party. Shah is known for his organisational abilities and strategic planning within the party across the country. As an electoral incharge of BJP party from Uttar Pradesh, he turned fortunes of the party in the state with a spectacular result. In the current elections, under the leadership of Shah, BJP and its ally won 73 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP. The party\u2019s vote share in the state has increased almost two and half times in less than two years. Amit Shah was born on October 22, 1964 in a philanthropist family. At a tender age of 14, Shri Amit Shah joined the Rashtriya Syawamsevak Sangh (RSS) as a \u2018Tarun Syawamsevak\u2019. In 1982, as a student of bio-chemistry, he was handed over the responsibility of the secretary of the students\u2019 organisation ABVP in Ahmedabad. He later became the secretary of BJP Ahmedabad city unit. For the first time, Shah was elected as an MLA in 1995, from Sarkhej assembly constituency. He was re-elected from the same constituency in 1998. He later shifted his constituency to Naranpura Assembly seat in 2012. In 2000, the Ahmedabad District Co-Operative Bank Limited was in totters and declared a weak bank due to lack of leadership. It was then that Amit Shah was brought in as the chairman of the bank, within a year the Bank cleared its debts and fell in line of other profit-making banks, with declaration of 10% dividend. In 1995, under the leadership of Keshubhai Patel, Shah became the youngest chairman of Gujarat State Financial Corporation (G.S.F.C.). From 2002, under the leadership of Narendra Modi, Shah held several portfolios in Gujarat, which includes transport, police, housing, border security, civil defense, gram rakshak dal, home guards, prison, prohibition, excise, law and justice, parliamentary affairs and the coveted home ministry. Amit Shah executed his brief to perfection, eventually beating competition within the BJP to emerge as party president ahead of state elections in Haryana and Maharashtra this year and Jharkhand and J&K next year. Shah\u2019s appointment reflects BJP\u2019s urge to consolidate its electoral gains further and expand its national footprint."], "https://www.themobileindian.com/news/realme-u1-launched-with-63-inch-full-hd-display-25mp-front-camera-24418": [" The Realme U1 comes three colour options - Ambiyious Black, Brave Blue and Fiery Gold.

This study sought to describe the visual aids, adaptations and compensatory strategies used by five amateur pianists with low vision when reading music, to identify the problems they face when using these aids, and to verify whether a head-mounted display (HMD) such as eSight Eyewear can be used to overcome some of them. In this exploratory study, the participants read and interpreted two excerpts of musical notation using eSight Eyewear. The data, collected through interviews, were coded using a qualitative method and a phenomenological approach. The results suggest that musicians with a VI use various visual aids, adaptations and compensatory strategies. However, these approaches are not without significant problems, particularly when they involve magnification. On the other hand, eSight Eyewear allows users to adjust magnification, have their hands free and use adapted musical notation. Many magnification-related problems are overcome with this HMD, which can be used to simultaneously read and interpret standard musical notation. However, reading sheet music with such a device remains a complex task, given the need to control head movements accordingly. KEYWORDS:  Reading musical notation is an essential skill for anyone studying music (Madell & H\u00e9bert, 2008). A visual impairment (VI) limits one\u2019s ability to read musical notation and compromises many aspects of playing a musical instrument; yet, for many people, music is an essential part of cognitive development. Persons with a VI should therefore be able to access music, both in its interpreted and in its written form (Hersh & Johnson, 2010). Persons with a VI face well-documented problems reading textual material. Various means for improving their performance have been identified, including the use of visual aids (Wolffsohn & Peterson, 2003) and modifying the visual presentation of the text (Foley, 2008). In comparison, the challenges inherent in reading music are not well known, and few means have been identified to help a musician with a VI read music. Reading a text and reading musical notation requires different visual abilities, due to differences in the way the information is presented visually and differences in the reading task itself (Comeau, 2010; Madell & H\u00e9bert, 2008). The main two issues faced by persons with a VI highlighted here are the visual presentation and the task of reading musical notation: The musical staff, consisting of five horizontal lines, serves as the frame of reference for localizing almost all the signs of musical notation (Gudmundsdottir, 2010; Read, 1979). Essentially, pitch is represented by the vertical position of notes on the staff, and time is represented by the horizontal position of notes. However, it is equally necessary to distinguish these elements in order to identify the relative length of a note: for example, a full or empty head, the form of the stem (whether it is present or not, and if there are flags or beams), or the presence of a dot (Gudmundsdottir, 2010; Housley, Lynch, Ramnath, Rogers, & Ramanathan, 2013; Read, 1979). Accessing this graphical presentation of music requires both detail vision and global vision (Housley et al., 2013). A musician therefore requires good acuity to identify both the pitch and the length of notes (head, stem, flag, beam, dot). Reading music also requires global vision. While the visual presentation of text is essentially linear, musical notation represents music both horizontally (length) and vertically (pitch). Studies of ocular movement have found that reading music involves more multidirectional movement than reading text (Udtaisuk, 2005). For example, musical scores for piano are presented on two staves (for the left and right hands). The staves are one above the other, showing notes to be played simultaneously. So when pianists advance through musical notation, their eye movements must alternate between the two staves (Dormehl, 2017; Furneaux & Land, 1999; Udtaisuk, 2005). Reading music is defined as \u201cThe act of decoding the symbols of staff notation using a musical instrument\u201d (Gudmundsdottir, 2010, p. 331). It therefore involves three specific challenges: (1) reading the notes at an intermediate reading distance (50 cm to 70 cm), (2) having the hands free to play the music, and in the case of playing piano (3) occasionally glancing down at the hands/keyboard. When the musician has a VI, magnification (with different means) and memorization are recommended to facilitate the reading of music; however, they increase cognitive load and task complexity (Bouabid, 2013; Coates, 2012; Housley et al., 2013; Jacko, Choi, Carballo, Charlson, & Moore, 2015), in addition to dealing with challenges such as glare caused by spotlights in concert halls, or poor ligihting in a rehearsal rooms. Magnification, achieved by reducing the eye/notation relative distance, is possible by bringing the notation closer with an adapted lectern (Clark & Murphy, 1998; Labbett, 1995; Whittaker, Scheiman, & Et Sokol-McKay, 2016), or by bringing it closer with one\u2019s hands. However, the lectern usually needs to be custom-made, since there are few adapted models on the market (Clark & Murphy, 1998; Labbett, 1995). When the reading distance needs to be particularly close, it becomes impossible to read the score while playing the piano. The musician needs to get close to the notation, read and memorize it before it can be played, increasing the task\u2019s complexity (Bouabid, 2013). Optical or electronic aids can be used to magnify the score (Coates, 2012; Labbett, 1995; Whittaker et al., 2016). However, since most of these aids are designed to facilitate the reading of text, they present certain problems when reading music (Coates, 2012; Housley et al., 2013). A table-mounted video magnifier provides access to the details in the notation, but the musician needs to stop playing to move the music on the CCTV platform (Clark & Murphy, 1998). There are few aids that can be used hands-free and at an intermediate reading distance (50 to 70 cm). The notation can be magnified by enlarging it with a photocopier, music publishing software or a handwritten transcription (Coates, 2012; Labbett, 1995)]. However, the resulting number of pages requires frequent page-turning, which interrupts the playing (Coates, 2012; Housley et al., 2013). More recently, digital sheet music has opened up new opportunities for VI musicians. Apps can display the musical notation on the screen of a computer and scroll with a pedal, freeing hands when turning pages. Some application designers have adapted their product to customers with low vision. For example, MusicReader PDF (Leon\u00e9 MusicReader, 2019) and eStand (https://www.estand.com/info2/) applications allow you to adjust the size of a score and scroll it half a page at a time (eStand Inc., 2019). The ForeScore application (https://forscore.co) allows to adjust the size of the notation while redistributing it (reflow), which would allow to triple the size of the original score (forScore, 2019). Nevertheless, the magnification offered by these products is not enough to suit all people with low vision. Finally, the Lime Lighter (Dancing Dots, 2019) is specifically designed for customers with low vision and can expand up to 10X. The pedal allows the movements through the notation either: from the beginning to the end, by system or by measure. With a high magnification, it becomes complex to navigate through the musical notation, and users must have access to digital partitions in MusicXML format (a scan may be necessary). Memorization or alternative means. In addition, Clark and Murphy (1998), as well as Coates (2012) encourage memorization, oral instruction and the use of recordings. However, memorization requires some preliminary work before interpretation, and the last two methods require an intermediary between the musician and the notation. There is still access with braille music notation (Braille Authority of North America, 2015). However, muscial braille notation must be read using at least one hand, so it cannot be read and interpreted simultaneously (Bouabid, 2013). Thus, persons with low vision would usually tend to use visual access to music sheet whenever possible. Given these obstacles to reading musical notation, the objective of this study was to explore the opportunities offered by a head-mounted display (HMD) such as eSight Eyewear. An HMD is an electronic visual aid that presents information on screens placed directly in front of the eyes (Ehrlich et al., 2017). Users move their heads rather than their eyes to explore their environment. They can modify the image (enlarge it, change the contrast, apply color filters, etc.) using a control panel (Geruschat, Deremeik, & Whited, 1999). Users can adjust the magnification and use various work distances (Harper, Culham, & Dickinson, 1999). Once the necessary adjustments have been made, the user\u2019s hands are free. HMDs first became available for persons with a VI in the late 1990s: LVES (Massof & Rickman, 1992), V-Max, Jordy and Jordy II (Louise E. Culham, Chabra, & Rubin, 2009; Geruschat et al., 1999). However, their use has been limited by problems encountered in the technology\u2019s development (Francis, 2005), the impossibility of incorporating peripheral vision (Peterson, Wolffsohn, Rubinstein, & Lowe, 2003), and its relative comfort, weight, appearance and cost (Francis, 2005; Harper et al., 1999). The technical specifications for eSight Eyewear have previously been presented in more detail (Wittich et al., 2018). The study device was a second-generation device with a high-definition camera and two Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) screens mounted on a frame that is comparable to a pair of fully-enclosing sunglasses. The remote control contains the processor and the battery. Magnification factors range from 1.3 X to 12.3 X (21.2 to 2.3 degrees horizontal field) (Wittich et al., 2018), the automatic fine-tuning takes place in real time and this HMD offers magnification at near (from 30 cm) as well as intermediate and distance vision. The user\u2019s prescription can be integrated into the device. The screens are positioned in immersive view or are inclined to occupy only the upper part of the visual field (VF). Even though users benefit from magnification immediately when wearing the device, to optimally operate it and master its use may take several months. To this end, eSight Corporation has developed eSkills, a program for developing the required visual skills (eSight Corporation, 2015). Given the small number of assistive devices with the potential to substantially improve the reading of musical notation while playing a musical instrument, and given the hands-free nature of this HMD, we decided to explore the potential benefits of using this technology for individuals with VI that play the piano. Our study had three objectives: 1) To describe the visual aids, adaptations and compensatory strategies used by pianists with a VI to read music. 2) To describe the problems faced by pianists with a VI when using these visual aids, adaptations and compensatory strategies to read music, and 3) To describe the perceptions of pianists with a VI of their visual access to music read with this HMD. The study\u2019s protocol complied with the Declaration of Helsinki (Williams, 2008) and was approved by the scientific and ethics committee of the member facilities of the Center de recherche interdisciplinaire en r\u00e9adaptation du Montr\u00e9al m\u00e9tropolitain (CRIR#1111\u20131115). This is a qualitative and exploratory study based on a phenomenological approach, exploring the perceptions of individuals in a heterogeneous group in order to identify and describe a shared phenomenon (Hesse-Biber & Leavy, 2010). A convenience sample of five participants was recruited in a visual impairment rehabilitation center, the CRIR/Institut Nazareth et Louis-Braille du CISSS de la Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie-Center, Longueuil, Quebec, Canada, by sending a message to program directors as well as an announcement using the distribution lists of various community-based organizations in VI. The inclusion criteria were: 18 to 65\u00a0years of age; a VI diagnosis received at least two years prior to the study; an assessment completed in the last two years by an optometrist specialized in low vision; a VI of 6/18 to 6/120 after correction and a VF greater than 30\u00b0; the ability to play the piano and to identify the pitch and duration of notes on a score; the ability to use various visual aids, and sufficient knowledge of French to verbally answer interview questions. The participants all signed a consent form prior to taking part in the project. Data on their vision (date of the assessment, pathology, refraction correction, visual acuity at distance and close vision, and visual field) were collected from the optometry assessment report. A questionnaire developed by the lead author asked participants to report socio-demographic data and musical profiles. These profiles included the age at which the participants began playing music, their experience, and their level of knowledge in musical theory (scales, chords, sight reading, etc.), based on a four-point Likert scale (1\u00a0=\u00a0no knowledge of musical theory; 4\u00a0=\u00a0extensive knowledge of musical theory). A two-part semi-structured interview was used to collect data on the participants\u2019 perceptions before and after using the HMD. The first segment described the various visual aids, adaptations and compensatory strategies used to read music (Objective 1) as well as the problems identified during their use (Objective 2). After the subjects had tried eSight Eyewear, a second segment dealt with reading music with the help of this aid (Objective 3). The questionnaire and interview were administered by the lead author. The interviews were recorded and verbatim transcripts were prepared for analysis. During the experimental phase, each participant took part in an individual meeting lasting approximately two hours. The meetings were organized in five steps: (1) verbal administration of the questionnaire on the participant\u2019s socio-demographic and musical profile (10\u00a0minutes); (2) the first part of the semi-structured interview on the means used to read music and the problems encountered (20\u00a0minutes); (3) a trial of the HMD: presentation, installation of the HMD based on the correction in the optometrist\u2019s report, adjustments to the parameters, and instruction on use with some exercises in the eSkills program (30\u00a0minutes); (4) trial use of the HMD to simultaneously read and play scores that each participant already knew (20\u00a0minutes), followed by an excerpt selected by the interviewer (20\u00a0minutes) (Agay, 1997; Schumann, 1996); and (5) the second part of the semi-structured interview on reading music using the HMD (20\u00a0minutes). The choice between the two sheet music excerpts was made by the lead author according to her assessment of each participant\u2019s sight reading abilities. Both excerpts included a variety of musical symbols (nuances, accents, alterations etc.), and each consisted of two pages, arranged side by side and printed in a standard format, eliminating the need for page turns. The notation had to be read at a distance corresponding to a standard position to read the music and could vary between 50 to 70 cm. Room lighting came from fluorescent ceiling bulbs. In some cases, a fluorescent accent lamp (Ott Lite, Tampa, Florida) had to be added to improve visibility with the HMD. The data were jointly analyzed by two evaluators, one of whom was the lead author. The Creswell (1998) approach was used. As the first transcripts were read, segments of significant texts related to the research objectives were identified and used to develop an initial system of codes. Then all the transcripts were read, and this system of codes was modified and applied to all the data. Ultimately, the codes were obtained in two different ways: those used for Objective 1 were inferred from the data, while those used for Objectives 2 and 3 were inspired by the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology (QUEST) questionnaire 2.0 (Demers, Weiss-Lambrou, & Ska, 2000), a tool used to assess user satisfaction with a technical aid. To ensure the scientific rigor of the study, the approach complied with the scientific criteria specific to qualitative methods (Poupart, 1997). Five amateur pianists with a VI (three women and two men) took part in this study. Table 1 presents a profile of their socio-demographic and visual characteristics and their level of musical knowledge. Two participants were in their 20s and the other three were in their 60s. They had a variety of visual diagnoses. Four participants had had a visual impairment since birth and the fifth since the age of 20. Their distance visual acuity in the better eye varied from 0.8 to 1.54 logMAR (equal to 6/37.5 and 6/210), and their near visual acuity varied from 0.8 to 1.88 logMAR (equal to 0.5 M at 8 cm and 12 M at 16 cm). Their self-reported musical skill varied from average to very high. One participant (P2) had a VA and a VF that fell short of the selection criteria; however, the research team decided to include this person in the study, given the rarity of visually impaired individuals that were qualified, available and interested to participate in this study. Another participant (P1) had taken part in a parallel study involving eSight Eyewear (Wittich et al., 2018), in a context other than reading music. All five participants had received rehabilitation services for visual impairment in the past and said that they were familiar with various visual aids. Their type of musical training varied, but all participants had taken piano lessons for over five years.The challenge of reading music notation for pianists with low vision: An exploratory qualitative study using a head-mounted displayAll authorsBianka Lussier-Dalp\u00e9 MSc, CLVT, Catherine Houtekier MSc, Jos\u00e9e Duquette MSc , Marie-Chantal Wanet-Defalque PhD & Walter Wittich PhD, FAAO, CLVT https://doi.org/10.1080/10400435.2019.1661315Published online:17 October 2019Table 1.

Definitions of the themes and categories\nDownload CSVDisplay Table  Table 2.  Definitions of the themes and categories The data demonstrated that visual access to musical notation is facilitated by magnification, by means other than magnification, or by non-visual means. Magnification is obtained by various means. This may involve reducing the distance between the eyes and the musical notation, either by approaching the score with a visual aid (lectern) or through a compensatory strategy (leaning toward the score or holding it in one hand to bring it closer). Magnification achieved by increasing relative size was possible with an adaptation, by using a photocopier to enlarge the score. Lastly, angular magnification or projection was achieved using various visual aids: microscope glasses, bioptic telescope glasses, a magnifying glass, or various mainstream technologies, such as electronic tablets. Some adaptations and strategies (see Table 3) were intended to facilitate visual access to reading music by means other than magnification. These improvements apply either to all of the musical notation (e.g., increasing the score\u2019s contrast) or just to certain parts (e.g., highlighting alterations, such as by underlining them, or adding color).The challenge of reading music notation for pianists with low vision: An exploratory qualitative study using a head-mounted displayAll authorsBianka Lussier-Dalp\u00e9 MSc, CLVT, Catherine Houtekier MSc, Jos\u00e9e Duquette MSc , Marie-Chantal Wanet-Defalque PhD & Walter Wittich PhD, FAAO, CLVT https://doi.org/10.1080/10400435.2019.1661315Published online:17 October 2019Table 3.  Visual aids, adaptations and compensatory strategies used\nDownload CSVDisplay Table  Table 3.  Visual aids, adaptations and compensatory strategies used All the participants used non-visual strategies and adaptations, in different forms and to varying degrees. For example, one participant played only from memory since losing her sight, while others would memorize only those parts of the musical notation that are difficult to identify visually. Other strategies relied on using hearing and the participant\u2019s musical knowledge. Various aids, adaptations and strategies were used depending on the context (learning, a concert, at school, at home, etc.) or in different combinations. Some of these combinations were simple (e.g. combining several types of magnification): \u201cI make photocopies at a 2X enlargement and use a lectern a lot, but I still get very close to the lectern.\u201d [P5]. Other combinations were more complex (e.g. adjusting the work distance according to how well a piece has been memorized). The result was a complex and creative use of various means that provide the pianist with some access to reading music. What problems do pianists with a VI have when using visual aids, adaptations and compensatory strategies to read music? The use of an aid, adaptation or strategy may result in many problems related to its effectiveness and ease of use, how easily it can be adjusted, its comfort in use, and its weight, dimensions and appearance. In terms of effectiveness and ease of use, these difficulties (see also Table 4) were related to the visibility of the notation and to musical performance. Concerning visibility, the use of various forms of magnification was required, but this also becomes problematic because it affects global vision. Despite the magnification, there are times when certain details of the notation cannot be identified. So the visibility of details and of the notation in its entirety is compromised. On the other hand, certain visual aids or adaptations allow some visual access to the notation, but they compromise performance. To follow written music when using magnification, occasionally it is necessary to use one\u2019s hand. Since only a small part of the notation is visible at any given time, the use of one hand becomes necessary to follow it, change from one measure to the next on the tablet (here defined as an aid), change pages (here considered an adaptation) or hold the booklet (here considered a strategy). Taking one hand off the keyboard necessarily affects one\u2019s performance. This problem arises independent of the means used for magnification, given the following examples:The challenge of reading music notation for pianists with low vision: An exploratory qualitative study using a head-mounted displayAll authorsBianka Lussier-Dalp\u00e9 MSc, CLVT, Catherine Houtekier MSc, Jos\u00e9e Duquette MSc , Marie-Chantal Wanet-Defalque PhD & Walter Wittich PhD, FAAO, CLVT https://doi.org/10.1080/10400435.2019.1661315Published online:17 October 2019Table 4.  Difficulties encountered when reading music and access to reading music without and with eSight Eyewear\nDownload CSVDisplay Table  Table 4.  Difficulties encountered when reading music and access to reading music without and with eSight Eyewear Aid: \u201c[With the iPad], I can only read one measure at a time: I play the first measure, and then I have to slide the image on the screen to change measures, etc. So the reading is less fluid. I always need to follow with my hand.\u201d [P5] Adaptation: \u201cI needed to really enlarge my scores a lot and turn [pages] two or three times more often than the other students, so it ruined the flow. I had trouble following.\u201d [P3] Strategy: \u201cI virtually had to learn it by heart by reading my score, holding it in my right hand and playing with my left hand. Then I played with my right hand while holding the score in my left hand.\u201d [P4] Using these means requires investing time and effort before the music can be performed. This has an impact on motivation, in particular when new pieces are being learned, since there are several stages to adapting a score. When the music cannot be read and performed simultaneously, the notation must be memorized before it can be played. Some participants were uncomfortable because using an aid or a strategy (such as leaning closer) causes poor posture. Participants also spoke of problems associated with the weight, dimensions and appearance of the visual aid or the adaptation. For example, an articulating arm mounted on a stand cannot be carried back and forth between school and home. Large scores are considered too apparent; one participant\u2019s discomfort with using them in public caused her to give up on them. The decorum in classical music encourages restraint, so the reading distance may present a problem: \u201cIn concert, you can\u2019t be hidden behind your score. Everyone is dressed in black, with a black tie, black shirt, you don\u2019t want to stand out too much from the group.\u201d [P1] Ultimately, even though they had numerous means at their disposal, the participants all said that they still had problems reading music: \u201cI haven\u2019t found a solution that is truly comfortable. It would be better if it were still closer, if I didn\u2019t have to scroll through it, if I could see the whole page.\u201d [P1] How do pianists with a VI perceive their visual access to reading music when using an HMD? These perceptions were also classified into three thematic areas: its effectiveness and ease of use, its ease of adjustment, as well as its comfort, weight, dimensions and appearance. In terms of effectiveness and ease of use, the visual access to reading music afforded by an HMD was described in terms of the visibility of the notation and the player\u2019s musical performance. All the participants were able to read the musical notation with an HMD. One of the positive aspects concerned visual access to the details in the notation as well as to the overall notation: \u201cBeing able to see both staves at the same time was wonderful \u2026 Not only was I able to see the two staves, I was even able to see part of a third one.\u201d [P3] Being able to adjust the magnification factor allowed participants to set priorities, depending on the context, on their access to details or the overall notation: \u201cWhat I liked the most was that you can magnify as much as you like, you can see the entire piece or just small details, it\u2019s really impressive to be able to choose. With a photocopy enlargement, you have to move in closer.\u201d [P3] Being able to read from a standard reading distance was also mentioned: \u201cWith eSight, the score is far away, I don\u2019t need to get close to it, I only need to zoom in \u2026 What\u2019s great is to really have the right distance.\u201d [P5] On the other hand, the loss of global vision created by the aid generated problems finding one\u2019s place in the notation. During their trials, all the participants said that they occasionally lost their place in the score. Use of the HMD appeared to be more difficult when compared with the means the participants were currently using: \u201cIf you move too quickly, you lose your place, but when you enlarge a score [using photocopies], you don\u2019t lose your place. It\u2019s visually easy.\u201d [P3] Small involuntary movements of the head affect the stability of the image: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to have Parkinson\u2019s when playing with this thing!\u201d [P2] There were also some negative comments about image quality, particularly when using a large magnification factor or a color filter: \u201cWhen you zoom in, it starts to flash.\u201d [P4] \u201cSometimes it flashes, particularly when using the black and white filter.\u201d [P5]. In terms of music performance, given that the HMD does not require the use of hands, users can read and play the musical notation simultaneously: \u201cI can keep my hands on the keyboard. I advance by moving my head and I read, I play. I don\u2019t need to use my hands off the keyboard, as I do with the iPad.\u201d [P5]. On the other hand, looking back and forth between the score and the instrument appears to be a complex task with an HMD: \u201cWhen I\u2019m not sure that I have the right key on the keyboard, I need to look; then it becomes difficult to find my place in the score.\u201d [P1]. In terms of ease of adjustment, all the participants believed that the HMD required minimal time and effort before they can play a score: \u201cYou can read with the material you have in hand, it\u2019s normal, it doesn\u2019t need to be adapted.\u201d [P5] Given that this HMD can be used with an intermediate reading distance, it is possible to adopt an appropriate and comfortable posture when playing the piano. On the other hand, wearing these electronic glasses led to ocular fatigue, even some discomfort, particularly in the first few minutes of the meeting: \u201cAt one point you feel nauseous.\u201d [P2]. Participants had different comments about the HMD\u2019s dimensions and wearability: \u201cEsthetically, the glasses are cool, they\u2019re stylish. Honestly, they\u2019re quite nice.\u201d [P5] \u201cI don\u2019t see myself in concert on a major stage. The eSight glasses would stand out too much!\u201d [P1] After conclusion of the experiment, all participants expressed interest in having access to an HMD to read musical notation. However, the main barrier that was expressed concerned the financial investment necessary to become a device owner. This study sought to describe the visual aids, adaptations and strategies used by pianists with a VI to read music notation, to identify what problems remain despite such use, and to examined their perceptions of their visual access to reading music when they use a head-mounted electronic magnification device. Some of the means used by the study\u2019s participants have previously been discussed in the literature: an adapted lectern, microscope glasses and bioptic telescope glasses (Clark & Murphy, 1998; Labbett, 1995), enlarging the score using a photocopier (Clark & Murphy, 1998; Labbett, 1995), as well as memorization and oral learning (Clark & Murphy, 1998; Coates, 2012). On the other hand, this study has revealed that pianists with a VI also use adaptations that foster visual access by means other than magnification, and that they even use a combination of several aids, adaptations and strategies. The data revealed that consumer technologies such as electronic tablets are also used. It is known that, for reading texts, tablets are like dedicated electronic visual aids (Crossland, Silva, & Macedo, 2014; Morrice, Johnson, Marinier, & Wittich, 2017; Wittich, Jarry, Morrice, & Johnson, 2018). A survey of persons with a VI confirms that they are being used in everyday life (Crossland et al., 2014). In music, Housley et al. (2013) identified this potential and developed an application that allows tablets to display adapted musical notation. However, none of the articles have reported on the use of this type of application, or even the use of a tablet when reading music. Our participants, however, reported that such applications and technologies are indeed being used, and that they are useful. Despite the implementation of an amalgam of compensatory means, significant difficulties remained. The use of magnification is rendered more complex by the visual presentation of notation. Notation consists of components of varying size, and achieving a balance between the visibility of details and the overall notation appears to be a difficult task. It is known that large magnification limits global vision and affects one\u2019s ability to anticipate, which is important in music, since experienced readers generally read one measure ahead of what they are playing (Goolsby, 1994; Madell & H\u00e9bert, 2008). On the other hand, less magnification compromises one\u2019s ability to identify certain details in the notation. Among our participants, magnification also affected musical performance. Accordingly, Coates (2012) and Housley et al. (2013) mention that reading an enlarged score requires frequent interruptions to performance as the musician turns the pages of the score. Bouabid (2013) indicates that bringing the musical notation closer with one or both hands makes memorization necessary. Magnification therefore allows a certain access to the notation, but also causes secondary problems. On this subject, Jacko et al. (2015) indicate that adapting or memorizing the notation produces a delay and requires an intermediate resource between the musician and the notation. In our study, the participants adapted the notation themselves, which they found discouraging. Lastly, our results suggest that there are certain problems related to the adoption of an uncomfortable posture. In addition, obstacles to use of aids, adaptations and strategies are associated with the appearance of the devices used. Tuttle and Tuttle (2004) as well as Wanet-Defalque and Machab\u00e9e (2009) indicated that the use of certain visual aids draws attention to the fact that the users have a VI, and some prefer not to use such aids for fear of being stigmatized. eSight Eyewear can improve the visibility of musical notation, including by limiting the problems associated with magnification. First, this HMD allowed the participants to adjust the magnification factor. Culham, Chabra, and Rubin (2004) as well as Culham et al. (2009) underscore the importance of this feature in appraisals of an HMD used in various reading tasks and activities of daily living (ADL), since the user can choose to emphasize the visual field or a sufficient reserve acuity. Since musical notation has components of varying sizes that require detail vision as well as global vision (Housley et al., 2013), selection of a precise level of magnification allows the user to find this balance between the VF and the reserve acuity required to read music. Our participants liked the fact that the device\u2019s magnification factor could be adjusted in response to how well they knew the score; the literature reviewed does not discuss the functional potential of this particular innovation for pianists with a VI. It therefore appears that the preferred magnification factor for musical notation is influenced by several factors not identified in the literature: being able to adjust it appears fundamental. Wearing an HMD has the additional advantage of allowing the user to read music at an intermediate reading distance, which is key, since few visual aids can be used to magnify at this distance. For some participants, it was possible to sight-read normally, meaning they could read while playing the instrument, without prior memorization. For others, this was a comfortable reading distance since the electronic glasses allowed them to read a score while adopting an appropriate posture. Furthermore, this HMD can be used to read standard musical notation without having to adapt it beforehand. Adapting scores beforehand is known to involve several steps and is an obstacle to engaging in a musical activity (Jacko et al., 2015; Smaligo, 1998). Flexible viewing distance is further an advantage to see, for example, a conductor; however, whether the possible stigma of wearing an HMD in a concert situation might inhibit the use of such a device was not specifically addressed by our participants, and this aspect will require further study. Our results nevertheless demonstrated that the participants still faced significant problems using the device. For example, while wearing the HMD, the notation is read by moving one\u2019s neck and head. However, these movements require accuracy, otherwise the device will not show the desired location on the notation. Another problem found during our study was associated with the fact that reading a score occasionally involves looking down at the instrument to determine finger positions (Gilman & Underwood, 2003; Madell & H\u00e9bert, 2008). With eSight Eyewear, moving between two different view targets in this way occasionally leads to losing one\u2019s place in the score. Similar problems with HMDs have been reported in the literature. Culham et al. (2004) compare the use of various optical aids and HMDs for ADLs, such as filling out a cheque and identifying food products. They found that their participants were systematically less successful at completing these tasks when they used HMDs. They explain that this result stems from the fact that these tasks do not require visual acuity as much as eye-hand coordination, stabilization of the head, and precise scanning with the head and the eyes. Francis (2005) also claims that oculo-manual tasks are rendered more complex when using an HMD, since it exacerbates movements in proportion to the magnifying factor used. This means that the user must control movements of the neck and shoulders in order to maintain a stable image (Geruschat et al., 1999; Wolffsohn & Peterson, 2003). Despite some major problems, our participants spoke of two strategies that can be used to avoid losing their place in the score. One consists of looking below the HMD screens to see the keyboard using their habitual lower peripheral vision, taking advantage of the fact that the eSight device does not obstruct this portion of the musician\u2019s natural visual field, and thereby avoiding any movement of the head; the other involves making this a non-visual task by using one\u2019s ear and musical knowledge. The size of the sample prevented attainment of data saturation (Drapeau, 2004); therefore the sample did not represent all profiles of pianists with a VI. Since the participants provided comments about the HMD after trying the device just once, we were unable to determine whether their opinions reflect their impressions after longer-term use. On this subject, Harper et al. (1999) suggest that a period of adjustment is necessary to achieve optimal use of an HMD. Several months of use would therefore be necessary before the use of such an HMD could be fully mastered. Our study did not permit the testing of this hypothesis. Since this study was carried out with pianists with a VI, the results are not necessarily generalizable to users of other musical instruments. Lastly, since this study employed a qualitative approach, it was based on the participants\u2019 perceptions, and provides no information on their objective performance in reading music. Few studies have addressed access to musical notation among persons with a VI. Since the use of an HMD to read music holds promise, a study involving a longer-term trial and a larger sample would be relevant, as well as a study with users of other types of musical instruments, with their different associated visual and postural requirements. Furthermore, tests could be performed of evaluation tools for the objective measurement of visual capacity while reading music. Lastly, as is the case for reading texts (Foley, 2008), better knowledge of certain factors associated with better music-reading performance would give persons with a VI better access to this type of reading, and would help clinicians provide them with better support. Considering the scope of the problems encountered by persons with a VI when they read music and the potential of eSight Eyewear, this study suggests that pianists with a VI should consider using an HMD to read and interpret musical notation. The use of this HMD solved some significant problems caused by magnification, since it allows users to adjust the magnification factor and use an intermediate reading distance, and frees up users\u2019 hands. Lastly, the problems identified during the use of these electronic glasses suggest that persons who want to use them to read music could benefit from training on their use. Table 1.

This is odd in a status-obsessed city in a status-obsessed country. But then Jashodaben Modi, 62, is no ordinary prime minister\u2019s wife. For a long time, nobody knew for certain the former primary school teacher existed. As it became clear last year that Narendra Modi, the chief minister of the state, might take power at a national level in the world\u2019s biggest democracy, the question of his possible early marriage was raised. Yet mystery endured. Only when Modi, as required by law, filed nomination papers as the candidate of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, did any remaining doubt disappear. The prime minister to be filled in her name in the box marked spouse. The match had been arranged when both were very young and did not last long, though they never divorced. But, after keeping a low profile since Modi won a landslide election in May, Mrs Modi has hit headlines. She has not taken kindly to the government\u2019s decision to provide her with armed bodyguards around the clock, even when she travels in rickety three-wheeler taxis. She has now filed a request under freedom of information legislation to find out why she has been given security cover and has registered a series of concerns. \u201cI am surrounded by five security guards all the time. Often my relatives or I have to cook for them, my sister-in-law has to make their beds. This is a bit annoying,\u201d Jashodaben Modi told Reuters news agency by telephone. \u201cYou see, it gets really chaotic when I have to travel, because I use public transport and the guards are following me in an air-conditioned car.\u201d This astonishing inversion of usual practice in India, where society ladies will eat lunch in expensive restaurants while maids sit outside in the sun, and where nannies follow the offspring of the famous to school to carry their bags, explains why Mrs Modi was not recognised when recently in Mumbai. Ashok Modi said he supported his sister\u2019s decision to file the request \u2013 under law passed by the previous government led by the centre left Congress Party. The Special Protection Group, an elite force modelled on the Secret Service that guards US presidents, is responsible for the security of the prime minister and his immediate family members by law. The Indian media have taken different lines on the story. Some have stressed Jashodaben Modi\u2019s fear of her bodyguards, others their demand \u201cto be treated as guests\u201d and the possible financial implications that might have for the prime minister\u2019s estranged spouse. The Firstpost website, a local news site, surmised that Jashodaben\u2019s \u201cdemand to know what security arrangements she is entitled to hints at a woman who wants to take back control of her life.\u201d The Mumbai Mirror tabloid saw evidence of something else. \u201cI wish to be with him. If he calls me, I am eager to start a new life with him. But it has to be he who calls,\u201d she was reported to have said."], "https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-National_Democratic_Alliance_(India)": [" Detailed Pedia National Democratic Alliance (NDA) (IAST: R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u012bya Janat\u0101ntrika Ga\u1e6dhabandhana) is a centre-right to right-wing and conservative Indian big tent political alliance led by the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It was founded in 1998 and currently controls the government of India as well as the government of 17 Indian states, and 1 Union Territories.\n Its first chairman was Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. L. K. Advani, the former Deputy Prime Minister, took over as chairman in 2004 and served until 2014, and Amit Shah has been the chairman since 2014. The coalition ruled from 1998 to 2004. The alliance returned to power in the 2014 general elections with a combined vote share of 38.5%. Its leader Narendra Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014. In the 2019 general election, the alliance further increased its tally to 353 seats with combined vote share of 45.43%.\n The NDA was formed in May 1998 as a coalition to contest the general elections. The main aim of the NDA was to form an anti-Indian National Congress coalition. It was led by the BJP, and included several regional parties, including the Samata Party and the AIADMK, as well as Shiv Sena, but Shiv Sena broke away from the alliance in 2019 to join the Maha Vikas Aghadi with Congress and the NCP. Samata Party is also broke away from alliance in 2003 after formation of Janta Dal (United). The Shiv Sena was the only member which shared the Hindutva ideology of the BJP. After the election, it was able to muster a slim majority with outside support from the Telugu Desam Party, allowing Atal Bihari Vajpayee to return as prime minister.\n The government collapsed within a year because the AIADMK withdrew its support. After the entry of a few more regional parties, the NDA proceeded to win the 1999 elections with a larger majority. Vajpayee became Prime Minister for a third time, and this time served a full five-year term.\n The NDA called elections in early 2004, six months ahead of schedule. Its campaign was based around the slogan of \"India Shining\" which attempted to depict the NDA government as responsible for a rapid economic transformation of the country. However, the NDA suffered a defeat, winning only a 186 seats in the Lok Sabha, compared to the 222 of the United Progressive Alliance led by the Congress, with Manmohan Singh succeeding Vajpayee as prime minister. Commentators have argued that the NDA's defeat was due to a failure to reach out to the rural masses.\n The National Democratic Alliance does not have a formal governing structure such as an executive board or politburo. It has been up to the leaders of the individual parties to make decisions on issues such as sharing of seats in elections, allocation of ministries and the issues that are raised in Parliament. Given the varied ideologies among the parties, there have been many cases of disagreement and split voting among the allies.\n Owing to ill health, George Fernandes, who was the NDA convener until 2008, was discharged of his responsibility and replaced by Sharad Yadav, the then national president of the JD(U) political party. On 16 June 2013, the JD(U) left the coalition and Sharad Yadav resigned from the role of the NDA convener. Then the CM of Andhra Pradesh Chandrababu Naidu was made the NDA convener.\n On 27 July 2017 JD(U) with the help of BJP formed the government in Bihar. Later, on 19 August 2017 JD(U) formally rejoined the NDA after 4 years.\n The BJP has previously been the sole party in power in Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Rajasthan. It has also ruled Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh as part of coalition and alliance governments.\n The BJP has never been in power in 3 states - Kerala, Telangana, (between 1999 and 2004 BJP in alliance with TDP ruled a United Andhra Pradesh) and West Bengal. But BJP led NDA has ruled many local governing institutions including corporations, municipalities, panchayats and has also been elected to many Lok Sabha constituencies, state assembly constituencies and local body divisions and wards in these 3 states.\n \n Last election\n Note that it refers to nomination by alliance, as the offices of President and Vice President are apolitical.\n Electoral mandates\n Time in office\n Bhairon Singh Shekhawat\n(2002\u20132007)\n Venkaiah Naidu (2017\u20132022)\n Jagdeep Dhankhar (2022\u2013)\n Contested by BJP symbol lotus\n Contested by AIADMK two leaves symbol\n JJP joined hands with NDA to forming a stable government at Haryana with BJP\n Shiv Sena exited from the NDA, as BJP was not willing to agree for Sharing CM Post with Shiv Sena to form government in Maharashtra.\n BJP, AJSU sever ties in Jharkhand days before Assembly elections 2019.\n This page was last updated at 2022-12-06 16:52 UTC.

Here\u2019s how it works.  Dual SIM connectivity is a must-have in Asian markets, particularly India, where cellular plans are extremely affordable. The arrival of Jio has catalyzed the market like never before, with the entire industry reducing rates to stay competitive. For instance, my Airtel plan currently costs \u20b9499 ($7.30) for three months, and I get 2GB of 4G data per day, unlimited calls, and 100 texts a day. That comes out to \u20b9166 per month ($2.4) for 60GB of 4G data. Jio is just as affordable, with the carrier offering 1.5GB of 4G data per day, 100 daily texts, and unlimited calls for 3 months at just \u20b9449 ($6.55). The carrier also includes free subscription to its slate of digital content services with each plan. I used cellular plans as the preface of this story as it gives context into the current state of the Indian telecommunications sector, and it also allows me to segue into the crux of the post: dual SIM connectivity. With the country offering some of the lowest cellular data rates anywhere in the world, dual SIM usage has skyrocketed over the course of the last year, particularly following the launch of Jio. The carrier gave away free data for the first six months of operation in a bid to attract customers, and the strategy worked: Jio now has over 190 million subscribers, and is the world's largest data network. Dual 4G LTE enables 4G connectivity on both SIM cards. Until last year, most phones that came with dual SIM card slots offered 4G connectivity on just one SIM card, with the secondary defaulting to either 3G or 2G speeds. But that wouldn't work with Jio, as the carrier doesn't have any 3G or 2G spectrum, solely relying on 4G connectivity. Therefore, chip makers like Qualcomm and MediaTek demoed dual 4G LTE last year, and the feature is now a mainstay on phones sold in 2018. As the name suggests, dual 4G LTE enables 4G connectivity on both SIM cards, allowing you to switch between two 4G networks seamlessly. Dual 4G VoLTE is a subset of the feature, and it allows you to make HD calls from either SIM. So if you have two SIM cards and both facilitate VoLTE, you can choose from either carrier before making a call. Dual 4G LTE relies on Dual SIM Dual Standby, which uses a single transceiver but lets both SIMs be active, facilitating better battery life. Most phones launched in 2018 offer dual 4G LTE as standard, with Qualcomm baking the feature into its current-gen Snapdragon 600 series and above \u2014 the Snapdragon 636, 660, 835, and 845 all offer the feature. MediaTek likewise offers dual 4G LTE in the Helio P60, and HiSilicon's Kirin 970 also supports the feature, as does Samsung's latest-gen Exynos chipsets. Phones running any of the chipsets mentioned above can leverage dual 4G LTE, but here's a quick list of some of the more popular models available in the market today: Samsung and Nokia retroactively enabled the feature via an OTA update on the Galaxy S9 and the Nokia 7 Plus, but that only works in a scenario where the chipset supports dual 4G LTE. So it isn't possible to roll out the feature to an older phone unless it meets the requisite hardware needs.

The sector provides a wide range of services and is engaged in the manufacturing of over 6,000 products \u2013 ranging from traditional to hi-tech items. Given the government of India\u2019s push for a self-reliant economy or Atmanirbhar Bharat, the Indian MSME sector is poised for rapid growth and is seeking greater integration with major global value chains. India\u2019s micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) enjoy significant government policy support, such as through sector-based production-linked incentives (PLI) programs, incentives targeting specific regions like the Northeastern states, or schemes for businesses linked to technical skilling and digital tools, applications, and technologies, among others. Relief measures are announced from time-to-time to combat force majeure events like the COVID-19 pandemic. As per some estimates, there are about 63.05\u00a0million micro industries,\u00a00.33 million small, and\u00a0about 5,000\u00a0medium enterprises in the country. The state of Uttar Pradesh has the largest number of estimated MSMEs with a share of 14.20 percent of the total MSMEs in the country. West Bengal comes as close second with a share of 14 percent, followed by Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra at eight percent. Responding to parliamentary questions in a written reply (July 15, 2022), the Ministry of State for Micro Small and Medium Enterprises stated that MSMEs contributed to 35.98 percent of India\u2019s total manufacturing output in 2020-21, albeit down from 36.68 percent in 2019-20. As per a recent Assocham-Crisil report titled MSMEs back to the grind, MSMEs provide employment to about 111 million persons in India and contribute to approximately 50 percent of overall exports from the country. MSMEs account for 27 percent of India\u2019s GDP and serves as the backbone of the economy.

REGISTER TODAY From July 1, 2020, the government has implemented the new categorization MSMEs in India based on an upward revision in the definition and criteria. The definition of who qualifies as an MSME in India is based on investment and turnover and applies to entities in manufacturing and services sectors:  The\u00a0Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 governs the coverage and investment ceiling of MSMEs in India. The Act recognizes two categories of MSMEs \u2013 manufacturing and services, whose definition criteria have now been rationalized on an equal footing as per market and price conditions. Prior to May 2020, the MSMED Act, 2006 had provided separate definition criteria for manufacturing and service MSME units, with very low financial limits. Changes to these criteria were announced in the first tranche of the Atmnirbhar Bharat economic package on May 13, 2020, to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MSME Ministry notified a new procedure of registration via the Udyam Registration Portal, which came in effect July 1, 2020. Any person who intends to establish a micro, small or medium enterprise may file the Udyam Registration online on the Udyam Registration portal, based on self-declaration with no requirement to upload documents, papers, certificates or proof. On registration, the enterprise (referred to as \u201cUdyam\u201d in the Udyam Registration portal) will be assigned a permanent identity number called the \u201cUdyam Registration Number\u201d. An e-certificate, namely, the \u201cUdyam Registration Certificate\u201d will be issued on completion of the registration. Quick points: As of July 21, 2022, there were a total of 9,714,279 MSMEs registered on Udyam, including 9,282,256 micro enterprises, 393,824 small enterprises, and 38,199 medium-sized enterprises. Telecommunications Healthcare Electronics Pharmaceuticals Other areas that offer opportunities for MSMEs include tourism; sustainability; hyperautomation, which include artificial intelligence (AI); machine learning (ML); RPA; and advanced analytics; information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services; chemical; automotive; renewables; gems and jewelry; textile; food processing; drones-as-a-service; and agriculture. India has initiated various schemes and measures to allow MSMEs easier access to funds, to modernize the sector, and make it more competitive in the global market. These include schemes for credit guarantee, MSME cluster development, regeneration of traditional industries, growth of rural industries, entrepreneurship and skill development, procurement and marketing support, promotion in the North East Region (NRE) and Sikkim, infrastructure development and capacity building, and digital tools, applications, and technologies, among others. Examples include the Prime Minister\u2019s Employment Generation program (PMEGP), Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI), \u2018Strengthening Pharmaceuticals Industry\u2019 (SPI), A Scheme for Promoting Innovation, Rural Industry & Entrepreneurship (ASPIRE), Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro and Small Enterprises, Micro and Small Enterprises Cluster Development Program (MSE-CDP), Promotion of MSMEs in North Eastern Region and Sikkim, etc. Some of the concessions for MSMEs under Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 are listed below: The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises has adopted the cluster development approach as a key strategy for enhancing the productivity and competitiveness as well as capacity building of micro and small enterprises (MSEs) and their collectives in the country. A cluster is a group of enterprises located within an identifiable and as far as practicable, contiguous area or a value chain that goes beyond a geographical area and producing same/similar products/complementary products/services, which can be linked together by common physical infrastructure facilities that help address their common challenges.

There's even one which claims that Mukherjee still harbours PM aspirations, an old unfulfilled desire gnawing his entrails like a teenager's first love.  The fact is that apart from his bizarre endorsement\u00a0\u2014 rather glowing praise \u2014 of KB Hedgewar, his visit and speech was not spectacular at all and something of a damp squib after all these days of anticipation. This was a generic Class 10-level lecture in Indian history on national integration with the mandatory Rabindranath Tagore quotes to Mohan Bhagwat and his cohorts, like a kindly grandfather reminding a group of dull children about pluralism and tolerance. As a BJP spokesman pointed out, it was nothing spectacular and nothing PM Narendra Modi does not do abroad. Columnists and social media pundits have been decoding and fitting the speech into their confirmation biases and political corners according to their colours and stripes. As Mukherjee, a survivor in the corridors of power over several governments, and an expert in bureaucratic neutral banalities knows, the best part about mouthing truisms and generalities is that everyone can lay claim to you, and cherry-pick what suits their agendas. You come out as a noble soul far removed from earthly turmoil and distasteful mortal failings. Everyone's a winner. If anything at all, one gets the unmistakeable feeling from the heavy and ponderous speech that he meant this to be a last hurrah as a patrician statesman with his head far above in the snowy realms of noble idealism, skirting contentious issues, so that he would go down in history as one of India's last secular leaders. In other words, the man is looking for immortality, not a PM ship. Meanwhile, the RSS' purpose of finding legitimising for itself has been partially served by having a respectable leader like Mukherjee gracing their presence (even graciously signing the visitor's book under \"Great son of mother India\" to describe Hedgewar). Is Pranab babu aware of the following saying of Hedgewar's? Hedgewar quotation that owes its origins to a biography of Hedgewar by CP Bhishikar, titled Keshav: Sanghnirmata. \"As a result of the Non-Cooperation Movement of Mahatma Gandhi, the enthusiasm [for nationalism) in the country was cooling down and all evils in social life which that movement generated were menacingly raising their head. As the tide of national struggle came to ebb mutual ill-will and jealousies came on the surface. Personal quarrels raged all round. Conflicts between various communities had started. Brahmin-non-Brahmin conflict was nakedly on view. No organisation was integrated or united. The yavan-snakes reared on the milk of non-cooperation were provoking riots in the nation with their poisonous hissing.\" In fact no sooner had Mukherjee descended from the dias, that the IT cell creative brains were assiduously at work photo-shopping him with his hands across his chest in the RSS salute and putting the black cap on his head. Others harvested his speech and posted memes claiming that the former Congressman was now their fellow traveller. This was, of course, to be expected, and the worst fears of his daughter Sharmishtha Mukherjee realised, but the RSS/BJP IT cells still never cease to surprise with their remarkable speed and agility. See, this is exactly what I was fearing & warned my father about. Not even few hours have passed, but BJP/RSS dirty tricks dept is at work in full swing! https://t.co/dII3nBSxb6  Meanwhile, the Congress too has claimed victory saying that he went into the enemy camp and gave them an object lesson on Nehruvian values. To each their own purpose. None of it is hardly going to change a single thing on the ground, in any case. Pratik Sinha of AltNews astutely sums up the disconnect, \"Going gaga about both Nehru and Hedgewar in a span of few hours is the dictionary definition of duplicity.\" In many ways this \"duplicity\" has been a common factor in the tale of two presidents for these last two weeks. When President Ramnath Kovind's office announced that he would not be throwing an iftar party at the Rashtrapati Bhavan this year, the perennial debate around \"appeasement of minorities\" (in this case read Muslims) and secularism was reawakened and predictably the media has been buzzing with what constitutes or does not constitute secularism. The president's break with tradition has also irked many leaders of the Opposition, especifically the Congress party. K Rahman Khan, Congress leader and former minister for minority affairs, one of the first to be interviewed by Times Now, gave a very carefully worded response, punctuating his statement with long pauses, saying, \"Whether to hold the iftar party or not is his individual decision, but whether to link that to his not hosting the iftar party to avoid unnecessary expenditure is really not in tune with the way the iftar party should have been considered.\" The president has said that piety should not be mixed with politics and public funds should not be wasted on religious festivals. This is very much in line with ex-president Abdul Kalam's policy of not hosting such celebrations. All would be well were if not for the fact that questions of secularism always crop up when a Muslim festival like Eid or Moharram comes up. It is true that Rashtraparti Bhavan, apart from being bedecked in lights every Diwali (let's not be churlish), stays religion neutral. Carol singing on Christmas was stopped during Kalam's time though essential items and gifts were distributed to the needy. And now Kovind has broken tradition. Fair enough. But if we are talking about the president making a personal example (and an admirable one at that) for everybody in the administration starting from the PM to the lowest tehsil clerk, then there's a lot wrong with the picture perfect Uniform Civil Code (UCC) that the BJP keeps harping on. The main reason President Kovind gave for discontinuing iftar receptions was that it was a waste of taxpayer's money. In fact, much earlier in 2017, the Maharashtra government citing a high court order, which came the same year, directed all municipal corporations in the state, including the Pune Municipal Corporation, to stop using municipal funds for religious ceremonies, festivals and functions. In its order, the high court had stated that \"municipal corporations must bear in mind that secularism is part of the basic structure of the Constitution and municipal funds are primarily required to be spent on providing civic amenities to the citizens.\" Prima facie these are admirable sentiments. But let us take a look at how all this works out on the ground in practical terms. Post the government of India's decision to stop Haj subsidy\u00a0for Muslims, the Minority Coordination Committee (MCC), Gujarat, a minority rights organisation had, in a letter to Union home minister Rajnath Singh, sought a white paper from the government of India on the types of subsidies being offered to different religious organisations. Signed by Majuahid Nafees, the letter mentions that the NDA government progressively reduced the Haj subsidy ever since it came to power from Rs\u00a0750 crore two years ago to Rs\u00a0250 in 2017-18. Yet it was made to appear as if only Muslims cornered all religious subsidies.  Objecting to the effort to paint stopping of Haj subsidy as a \"big saving from wasteful expenditure\", MCC points to how a few years ago, the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad carried a budget of Rs\u00a01,150 crore, totally funded by the state and central governments. Moreover, in 2014, the UP government was accused of \"misusing\" Rs 800 crore of this amount. The MCC letter states, \"The Madhya Pradesh government spent Rs 3,400 crore, while the Central government spent Rs 100 crore for the Singhast Maha Kumbha in Ujjain\u2026 this apart, different governments spend huge funds for helping pilgrims visiting Badrinath, Kedarnath, Kailash Mansarovar, Amarnath and other spots... the government of Madhya Pradesh gives a subsidy of Rs\u00a050,000 for Kailash Mansarovar Yatra per passenger.\" Referring to Gujarat, the MCC letter says the state government \"has set up what is called Pavitra Yatradham Vikas Board for the \"development\" of 338 pilgrim spots across the state, even as it provided a budgetary allocation of Rs 106.69 crore in 2017-18. It also adds, \"The state government runs a course to teach the rituals of Hinduism, funded by the state.\" Moreover, the present government of Uttar Pradesh has \"begun programmes for the renovation and spiritual development of pilgrim spots in Kashi and Ayodhya, allocating Rs\u00a0800 crore.\" MCC points out, \"The question arises whether one should focus on government spending on Haj pilgrims alone.\" \"We believe that the state should not interfere in religious practices, which is a matter of personal choice,\" MCC says, even as quoting from a Supreme Court judgement, which reads, \"The relationship between man and God is an individual choice. The state is forbidden to have allegiance to such an activity\u2026 Mixing state with religion is not constitutionally permissible.\" It also quotes Article 27 of the Indian Constitution, which states, \"No person shall be compelled to pay any taxes, the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination.\" MCC also quoted from a Supreme Court order of 2011, Prafull Goradia vs The Union of India, pointing towards how religious funding \"violates Article 27\" of the Constitution. The order said, \"In our opinion Article 27 would be violated if a substantial part of the entire income tax collected in India, or a substantial part of the entire central excise or the customs duties or sales tax, or a substantial part of any other tax collected in India, were to be utilised for promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination.\" The duplicity reflected in partisanship and religious bias does not necessarily even have to come from contravention of rules on paper, it can come from the signals you send out and the optics that you create as a public servant who holds government office. And that creates a mental blueprint of a state and its engagement with secularism. In May 2018, when the president, who is the first citizen of India, and whose personal example should set a precedent visited the Brahma temple and offered prayers from the stairs on May 15, what kind of message was given out? Granted that he may have gone in his personal capacity, but were no public funds spent at all on that journey? Expecting the public to be legalistic and compartmentalise public office and private practice in their heads when such images are splashed all over the media, is not practical when it comes to optics. On November 24, 2017, replying to a two-day long debate in the Lok Sabha to commemorate the Constitution Day and the 125th birth anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar, PM Narendra Modi said \"India first\" is the only religion and Constitution the only \"holy book\" for his government. This was after February 24, 2017, on Mahashivratri when he had unveiled the Isha Foundation's 113-foot Shiva statue in Coimbatore. Disconnects, much? Or are we going to brush aside these things by saying, \"He went in his private capacity?\" Earlier, on October 6, 2016, Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje took part in a \"Rashtra Raksha Yagna\" at the Tanot Mata temple near the India-Pakistan border in Jaisalmer district, seeking the deity's blessings for the Army and the BSF with \"21 patrotic Brahmins\". CPI(M) and minority groups like the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind took strong exception to the yagna being organised on state expenses and described it as an act violating the spirit of secularism enshrined in the Constitution. From March 18 to 25, 2018, a Rashtra Raksha Mahayagya was held (BJP MP Maheish Girri was one of the organisers) with 180 hawan kunds, 2,100 priests and 51,000 attendees to pray for BJP's re-election in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, for seven days near the Red Fort. Union home minister Rajnath Singh flagged off the rath yatra associated with the Rashtra Raksha Mahayagya on February 14, 2018. Even if public funds were not spent on this jamboree, what kind of signals are sent, and lessons learnt, by the public at large when government functionaries actively encourage and indulge in religiosity in public spaces, no less the Red Fort? Maheish Giri even grandiosely announced that President Kovind, one of the invitees would light the last aarti. Whether President Kovind turned up or not is immaterial; what is important is that Giri as a public servant was neither rebuked, nor did Rashtrapati Bhavan issue a strong denial. In cases like this, the perception in the public mind takes root and the damage is done.  And very intentionally so by a party promoting Hindu Rashtra. Pranab Mukherkee indeed went to RSS in his private capacity. But neither did he have to describe Hedgewar in the fulsome terms of praise in the visitor's book that he did, nor subsequently deliver a lukewarm speech with a please-all approach. Are we all so na\u00efve to not believe that to a minority population besieged and marginalised in so many ways in post-BJP-RSS India, all this does not translate to a nod and a wink without actually spelling out where one's affiliations lie? Yes, this is the tale of two presidents, who displayed an unfortunate lack of spine, one taking refuge in legalism, rejecting a custom that need not have been construed as mixing politics with religion, the other in a generic exposition of unity in integrity, when he could have taken on the bull by the horns and said so much more. Are we as a nation really serious about secularism or looking for a Hindutva version of it? Because if we are serious about secularism, we should be able to do the following things: If there is UCC, all religious institutions should be taxed.

Meanwhile, Union Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu also extended New Year greetings to all fellow countrymen. \"I extend my hearty New Year Greetings tomorrow. I wish all fellow citizens a Happy, Prosperous, Productive and Fulfilling New Year,\" Naidu said in his message on the eve of beginning of New Year 2015. \"As we turn another page in the history of time, we introspect about what had gone by as we look at the new prospects.

The series of walkouts has intensified in the run-up to Christmas, with industrial action by railway workers and passport control officers threatening to ruin festive holiday getaways. On Wednesday, ambulance staff including paramedics and call handlers go on strike, prompting warnings from healthcare leaders. London's biggest hospital group said \"people giving birth will need to plan how they come into hospital\". \"Where people are planning any risky activity, I would strongly encourage them not to do so,\" said junior health minister Will Quince. \"We never want to alarm people but we have reached the stage where our leaders feel it's necessary to say they cannot guarantee patient safety,\" said Matthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation which represents services including ambulance trusts in England and Wales. \"We're entering into a very dangerous time and this is why we're upping even more our call to the government and to the trade unions to try to find a way of solving this dispute and helping us get through the winter,\" he told the BBC. At least three ambulance services declared critical incidents due to \"unprecedented\" pressure, saying they would prioritise treatment for those most in need, such as life-threatening cases. Up to 100,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland&nbsp;took to picket lines on Tuesday, just five days after the first strike in its 106-year history. Unions representing both National Health Service (NHS) nurses and ambulance workers have threatened further stoppages in the new year if the government keeps refusing to discuss pay. - 'Grip' - Employees across the UK economy are demanding salary rises in the face of decades-high inflation -- currently running at nearly 11 percent -- which is spurring the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. But the government insists it must stick to more modest increases for public sector workers recommended by independent pay review bodies. \"The best way to help them and help everyone else in the country is for us to get a grip and reduce inflation as quickly as possible,\" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told a watchdog panel of MPs. On the picket line outside a central London hospital opposite parliament, Mamta Pun, 25, said his stance on the pay dispute was \"a slap in the face for all healthcare staff, the general public and patients\". The intensive care nurse at the St Thomas' Hospital, where former premier Boris Johnson was treated in intensive care for Covid-19, said she and her colleagues finished shifts \"anxious, scared, terrified\" because of their workload. - 'Cold shoulder' - The RCN has also criticised Sunak's government for its pay stance and accused Health Secretary Steve Barclay of adopting a \"macho\" negotiating style during brief meetings held recently. It has warned that nurses would take wider industrial action next month if the government \"keeps giving our nursing staff the cold shoulder as they have to date\". \"It's really unfortunate, that come January, we will see more hospitals being involved and striking and that means more nursing staff involved,\" chief Pat Cullen said. Ministers plan to draft in 750 military personnel to drive ambulances and perform logistics roles to mitigate the impact of those strikes. Despite the government's dogged insistence that it will not negotiate over pay, polls indicate the majority of people support the nurses' stance, and to a lesser extent other workers walking out. YouGov polling published Tuesday showed two-thirds of Britons support striking nurses, with similar support for ambulance staff (63 percent). However, people were more divided on other industries such as rail workers -- whose walkouts 43 percent supported while 49 percent opposed -- and postal workers, where the split was 49 percent versus 43 percent. jj-har/phz/kjm Expectations heading into a UN biodiversity conference in Montreal were about as low as they could be.

US President Joe Biden said last month that the multi-state deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program was \"dead,\" but he would not announce that publicly, according to a video that surfaced Tuesday. India's headline inflation has broadened out and become \"stubborn\", the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its monthly bulletin on Tuesday.  With headline inflation projected to rise in the second quarter of the financial year starting next April after declining in the first three months, there can be no letting down of the guard, the bank said.  India's annual inflation rate fell to 5.88% in November, below the upper end of the RBI's comfort band of 6% for the first time this year.

Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s eventful tenure as Finance Minister was dotted by navigating the Indian economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis through massive doses of fiscal stimulus and introduction of \u201cretrospective\u201d tax laws that faced intense criticism. During the span of his career in the Congress and UPA regimes, Mukherjee handled several important economic portfolios of finance, commerce, shipping and industries ministries.

Mukherjee worked under three Prime Ministers \u2013 Indira Gandhi, Narasimha Rao and Dr Manmohan Singh. He is the only finance minister to have presented budgets both before the 1991 reforms in the license-permit raj regime as well after the 1991 economic reforms. He took bold decisions after the global economic crisis of 2008 which helped shield the Indian economy. As commerce minister in 1993, Pranabda championed the cause of trade liberalisation. \"Sad to hear that former President Shri Pranab Mukherjee is no more. His demise is passing of an era.

It is being claimed that the PM met his mother and Jashodaben during his recent visit to Gujarat.  Social media users are sharing the photo with the caption, \"Bharat Jodo Yatra is a success. The separated couple met during the Gujarat elections. Narendra Modi with Jashodaben.\" (Translated) Click here and here to see more posts. Fact Check  NewsMeter performed a reverse image and found four photos of PM Modi meeting his mother. One of the photos is identical to the viral photo but does not show Jashodaben sitting beside Mr. Modi's mother.  On 4 December, NDTV had tweeted the photo of Mr. Modi meeting his mother and said ahead of phase 2 of the Gujarat Assembly elections, the PM sought blessings from his mother Heeraben Modi at her residence in Gandhinagar. Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks blessings from his mother Heeraben Modi, at her residence in Gandhinagar ahead of Phase 2 polling in #GujaratElections #ElectionsWithNDTV pic.twitter.com/YSSazjwrTD We have highlighted the similarities between the original and the morphed image: On 4 December, ANI had tweeted a video of Mr. Modi meeting his mother. It also said that Mr. Modi met his mother Heeraben Modi at her residence in Gandhinagar. We did not see Jashodaben in this video, too. #WATCH | Gujarat: Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets his mother Heeraben Modi at her residence, in Gandhinagar. pic.twitter.com/C4uh1CMOFb Finally, we noticed the social media handle \"Deep4IND\" on the morphed photo that is being shared on social media. We searched for the handle on Instagram and found the morphed photo posted by the user Deepak Shukla on 4 December. According to the bio, Deepak Shukla is a digital creator of sarcasm and satire. We conclude that the viral photo showing PM Modi with his mother and estranged wife is morphed. Hence, the claim that PM Modi met Jashodaben during his recent visit to Gujarat is false."], "https://www.sbhambriadvocates.com/post/admissibility-of-cctv-footage-in-evidence-law": [" HOME FIRM PRACTICE AREAS CONTACT BOOK ONLINE BLOGS More Providing legal services since 2011 Based on the matter of Tomaso Bruno & Anr. V. State of Uttar Pradesh What kind of evidence is CCTV footage?  Close circuit television has become a crime controlling technique in last few decades, the footage generated using the security cameras in turn has become a progressively important source of evidence in criminal proceedings. With the rapid change in technology, it has become the need of the hour to adapt to the change, so the courts as well as the legislature in India has accepted the change and recognized it.  This change took place when Electronic records were recognized and explained as evidence under the IT Act, 2008. These electronic records include data, sounds and images which are either generated or recorded and sent or received in an electronic form, these records are admissible under the Indian Evidence Act and is known as Electronic Evidence. Now it is clear that CCTV footage falls under the preview of the Term Electronic Evidence which has been described under Section 65B(1) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. CCTV Footage to be considered as Primary Evidence or Secondary evidence? Now the question we have is will the CCTV footage will be considered as a Primary Electronic evidence or a Secondary Electronic evidence? The answer to that question is that it can be and might be considered as both Primary and Secondary Evidence under different circumstances. The virtual platforms like Cloud storage, Servers or the Hard-drives and other storages device connected to the Computer will be considered as a Primary source of evidence, but when a video has been extracted from any of the Primary source of evidence or transferred to a Compact Disk, DVD, Hard drive, memory  chip or Pen Drive using the computer which was originally used to store the footage using video camera or any other medium then the memory card or storage of the computer is the primary source and the CDs, DVDs, Chip, memory card etc., will be taken as Secondary Evidence and will be admissible in the court.  The audio and video recording will be considered as a valid source of Evidence. The Tape recording are recognized as Res gestae, which means that these recordings will be considered as relevant to the case and also will be considered as admissible Evidence, as it was stated in the case of N. Sri Rama Reddy Etc. v. Shri V.V. Giri. AS audio tapes could be tampered with like alteration or some part can be erases or re-recoded so, while accepting audio tapes or audio files of any footage shall be accepted only after some factors are checked, these factors involves establishing the voice of the speaker, its accuracy and relevancy will be checked whether they are been tampered or not, only if the file or tape passes all the tests only then it will be considered as a evidence.  Even video recordings also have to go through the similar kind of test to be considered valid evidence, as it was stated in Alagaaouram R. Mohanraj 7 Others v. Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Rep. by its Sectary & another. The concept of Audio and Video in CCTV footage as evidence. The audios and videos which are known to be original are the ones which are accepted as a valid source of Evidence. The audio and the video of the footage or only video in case of video only footage has to go through specific test in the respective formats to assure the court that the electronic Evidence which is the footage is not tampered or is genuine. The audio files have to go through series of test to establish the factors necessary to accept an audio file or tape to be a genuine evidence, these factors which are to be checked are as follows voice of the speaker, its accuracy, relevancy, exclusion of the possibility of tempering on manipulation, appropriate custody and clarity of the audio in question. This is done so that there is no gray area in admitting the evidence.  When we talk about the video recording as the evidence even they hold the same value as the audio recording but it also has to go through several tests as well. When video is submitted to the court which is the primary evidence it will not have to go through this test but in case of secondary evidence when the primary evidence could not be presented in the court it has to go through the tests. This Secondary Evidence are admissible under Section 65(B) of the Indian Evidence Act under specific conditions.  Admissibility of CCTV footage as Secondary evidence. CD, DVD, chip, Hard-Drive, Memory Chip, Pen Drive. \u2013 These kinds of electronic records are admissible as Primary Evidence as stated in the case of State of Gujarat vs. Shailendra Kamalkishor Pande as well as Secondary Evidence. Like, if the CD in question is Primary Evidence, then it is admissible without a question. CD, DVD, Hard-Drive, Memory Card or a Pen Drive to be Primary Evidence, it is necessary that the data, picture, video or anything which is to be presented to the court for Evidence is generated or recorded in that specific CD, DVD, Hard Drive, Memory Card or Pen Drive at the source. In other words, original media should be stored or recorded directly in that CD, DVD, Hard drive, Memory Card or Pen Drive that was self-generated and created without any human intervention as it was stated in the matter of Kishan Painter vs. The State. Whereas if a CD is a Secondary Evidence, like if it is a copy of the original and is a duplicated version, then it has to pass the test of authenticity, by complying with the conditions under section 65(B) as it was stated in the matter of Anvar P.V Versus P.K. Basheer and others. These conditions help to ensure the computer output is authentic, reliable, accurate, and exclusion of the possibility of tempering the Evidence. A certificate under section 65B(4) was held mandatory to be issued or the Secondary Evidence in electronic form will not be considered by the court as valid Evidence as stated in the case of  Sharadendu Tiwari vs. Ajay Arjun Singh and Ors. Tomaso Bruno & Anr. V. State Of U.P   Citation: Criminal Appeal No. 142/2015 Bench: Hon\u2019ble Justice R. Banumatji. Provisions involved: Indian Evidence Act, 1872 Section 65 and 114. Facts of the case  The matter was appealed by two Italian nationals(accused) who were convicted for the murder of another Italian national during their trip to Varanasi. All of them, the two appellants and the deceased were sharing a hotel room at the time of death.  The cause of the death was asphyxiation and most of the evidence was circumstantial.  The defence of the appellants was that the death occurred during their absence as the deceased was not feeling well and could not join them in an excursion. The prosecution version it appears is that the appellants did not go for any such trip and hence could not avail the plea of alibi.  In counter to this the defence relied on the absence of several pieces of digital evidence such as CCTV footage and SIM card details were presented to argue that the prosecution failed to prove any such case beyond reasonable doubt. Issue Whether the absence of  production of CCTV lead to acquittal of the accused? Judgement The court first notes the nature of the case and the relevance of the CCTV footage. Towards this the court notes that the case of the prosecution is largely circumstantial. There are no eye witnesses and medical evidence is limited to citing the cause of death as asphyxiation.  Further the conviction of the appellants was based on the testimony of the Hotel Manager and the Investigating Officer of the police, who stated that they saw no ingress into the hotel room of the deceased. This was based on viewing the CCTV cameras installed in the common areas of the hotel. However, the CCTV footage by itself was not adduced as evidence by the prosecution. Hence, in any case the court reasons that the CCTV footage constituted the best evidence. The effect of non-production of not adducing the best evidence, is viewed by the Court as material suppression which leads to an adverse inference under Section 114(g) of the Evidence Act. It is important to note that the reasoning of the Court is not limited to the absence of CCTV footage. It also involves the inconsistences in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and the medical examination, The court stated that, \u201cThe courts below have ignored the importance of best evidence. CCTV camera in the instant case and also have not noticed the absence of symptoms of strangulation in the medical reports. Upon consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the circumstances and the evidence adduced by the prosecution do not form a complete chain pointing to the guilt of the accused and the benefit of doubt is to be given to the accused and the conviction of the appellants is liable to be set aside.\u201d   Conclusion  Electronic records are admissible in Primary form just as in Secondary form of Evidence, subject to the fact that they are precise, prohibition of the chance of tempering or control, proper guardianship, are applicable and dependable. A significant condition which can't be over looked is the authentication under section 65B(4), without which an electronic record in the form of Secondary Evidence is not admissible, so given that fact it is very unlikely that CCTV will not be admissible in court if it is in correct condition.

It's a variation of the standard SD card (short for Secure Digital) and uses a similar set of electrical connections. That makes it possible to use microSD cards in standard SD card slots with the use of an adapter. MicroSD was introduced as a smaller alternative for portable electronics. Due to the demand for ever-smaller portable electronics, by the early 2000s, the traditional SD card was proving too large for many kinds of devices, such as smartphones. In 2005, the microSD card debuted at about one sixth the size and half the thickness of the SD card. An SD card measures 32 by 24 by 2.1 mm, while the microSD card is 15 by 11 by 1 mm.\u00a0 Despite the much smaller size, microSD cards have the same underlying architecture, including the same electrical pinout connections. Thus, instead of needing a new microSD card slot on computers, microSD cards can slip into adapters and use existing SD card slots.\u00a0 Aside from size, the major difference between SD cards and their microSD siblings is capacity. While the newest SDUC \"ultra capacity\" cards can support up to 128 TB, the microSD format is limited to a maximum of 1 TB.\u00a0 In addition, while most SD cards have write-protect tabs that allow you to lock them from being written to or erased, the microSD card does not have room for a physical write-protect tab and therefore can't be locked.\u00a0 As you might expect, the microSD card is used to hold large volumes of data in devices that benefit from its miniature design. Larger devices still rely on regular SD cards when practical because they support much larger capacities, but in particular, devices like smartphones, dash cams, and small cameras (like action cameras) rely on the microSD card for its tiny shape.

So, you will be surprised at how famous blind pianists can master the keys when they can\u2019t see them. In this article, I\u2019ll discuss the most famous black blind piano players the world has known and how they became master pianists. If you are making a list of the most renowned blind black piano artists, you will not miss seeing the names of the following: If you ask the average person today, he will tell you that Stevie Wonder is the most famous of all blind pianists, not just African Americans. The reason is that Stevie Wonder is still alive and active in his career. Second on the list would be Ray Charles, only because he is already gone but certainly not second in piano virtuosity to Stevie Wonder. Read on to learn more about the most renowned blind black pianists and some exciting details you may not know. If you list the world\u2019s most famous blind black pianists, it will include the likes of Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles. They are two of the most well-known African American pianists who have graced the entertainment industry over the past 50 years. Sadly, Ray Charles is no longer with us, so, almost always, in the minds of today\u2019s music lovers, Stevie Wonder takes the number one spot. But indeed, Ray Charles\u2019s piano prowess and songwriting capabilities were not too far from that of Stevie Wonder. But what about the other black and blind pianists that music lovers (not necessarily the hoi polloi) also admire and adore? These blind black musicians\u00a0deserve our admiration and appreciation as much as Ray and Stevie, even if they are not as famous. It\u2019s a toss-up between Stevie and Ray as to who gets the top spot. Many people say it\u2019s Stevie, but many others say it is Ray. But let\u2019s not forget the others.  That\u2019s one of the reasons why I composed this article. So, here\u2019s my list of the most famous black and blind piano artists in the world. Stevie Wonder needs no introduction to those who were teenagers during the 60s and the 70s, even up to the late 80s. Those were the most prolific decades of Stevie when he wrote and sold most of his iconic songs, such as \u201cI Just Called to Say I Love You,\u201d \u201cAll Is Fair in Love,\u201d and \u201cSuperstition.\u201d Even when the Beatles had broken up, Stevie still managed to market a hit song with ex-Beatle Paul McCartney titled \u201cEbony and Ivory.\u201d Success is sweet for Stevie, who was born prematurely, resulting in his medical condition of retinopathy of prematurity. Stevie taught himself piano after his family moved to Detroit. He was then aged 10. At the same time, he also taught himself harmonica and drums. Proof that his music is endearing to the masses is his induction into the R&B Hall of Fame in 2019. Stevie, as some bio reports say, was inspired by Ray Charles. He was regarded as a child prodigy, having achieved a level of expertise in piano playing at a very early age of 11. His early music training includes being a choir member in his church. Aside from Paul McCartney, Stevie has also collaborated with other recording artists who are the Who\u2019s Who of their day. They include Dionne Warwick, Michael Jackson, Elton John, and almost all the hit makers of the 80s and the 90s. Here\u2019s a video that will show you how talented Stevie is when it comes to singing and playing the piano:  Another blind black piano player and singer is Ray Charles. But in contrast to Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, the second African American pianist on my list, was not born blind.  He started to have problems with his eyesight at age 5. At age seven, Ray developed juvenile glaucoma, eventually leading to his total blindness. However, before becoming completely blind, Ray learned to play the piano. He developed his talent early at his school. Ray was taught by a music teacher about classical piano playing using the braille method. It was a complex process learning to read braille and learning the piano simultaneously. He was then already able to navigate the piano keys. What made him a great pianist was that he resolved to keep mastering the piano even if he lost his eyesight. As he learned the piano, he also learned to play blues and jazz, the music genre closest to his heart. The main contribution of Ray Charles to American music is the laying of the foundation of soulful music. Aside from being a good piano player, Ray was also an accomplished songwriter. That\u2019s probably one of the reasons Ray Charles inspired Stevie Wonder. Ray\u2019s prowess as a pianist, songwriter, and trailblazer of soul music was recognized posthumously inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2012. He was just the third African American to be given this award. You can best appreciate Ray\u2019s singing and piano playing if you will watch this video:  When piano virtuosity is discussed, the name Art Tatum will always be a part of the discussion. The fact that he was blind but was still regarded as one of the greatest piano players in America is what will make you admire the man. Infantile cataracts caused his blindness. This condition caused him to be blind in one eye. Even his other eye only afforded him minimal vision. So, with regard to piano playing, he was largely self-taught. Art started with the violin but eventually ended up playing the piano entirely. To offset his poor eyesight, Art played radio tunes and memorized reels from Victrolas (early phonographs) by ear. By the age of three, Art could already imitate tunes and recordings.  At a very early stage of his life, his fingers were already very fast when playing the piano. What was amazing was that all the notes were accurately played. The improvisation skill of Art was legendary. He could insert complicated chords between bars in harmonic progressions that were very advanced during this time. Art was credited as the one who led the way in utilizing harmonic distortions in jazz music. You will still see his influence on the pianists of today, blind or not blind. Unfortunately, Art is no longer with us. His being a piano prodigy has succumbed to his being a prodigious drinker. But don\u2019t mind that \u2013 we are focused on his piano virtuosity. You can see how he plays the piano in this video:  Another blind and black pianist who earned fame during his life is Marcus Roberts. Marcus also lost his sight at an early age, at five years old. But knowing his musical abilities, his parents gifted him with a piano. He was delighted and happily walked into it. He was born in Florida. All his family members were musicians, his mother being a religious singer. When Marcus was only four years old, his eyes began to develop glaucoma and cataracts. It was only when he was 12 that Marcus started his formal piano lessons. He got his early music training by listening for hours on the radio and picking out the melodies by ear. This was how Stevie Wonder, a Marcus friend, recounted Marcus\u2019s early music training. At first, he played the piano keys with only four fingers. He went to the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind. This is also the school where Ray Charles got his early piano lessons and training.  When his music teachers noticed that he was only using his four fingers on both hands, they said he could also use his thumbs. That dramatically transformed the way Marcus played his piano. His piano playing reminds you of how great piano players of the past made their music. But Marcus also developed his style that segues and sways in its unique ways. Aside from Jazz, Marcus also is good at playing classical music and swing. But mainly, he is a jazz musician and a composer. His fame started in the 1980s when he joined the Wynton Marsalis Band. But his ragtime piano playing style made him different from the rest of his band mates. After that stint, Marcus started his band and several bands after that. He has also made several recordings as a band member and leader. Another black and blind pianist that is worthy of being included in our list is Blind John Davis. His piano playing was described as possessing an elegant sophistication. He has had admirers not only in the United States but also in Europe. A biographer even claims that Blind John Davis may have been the first overseas gig for any American blues artist. After his first European performance, Davis seemed to prefer to play in that continent until he died in 1985 in Chicago. Blind John Davis was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, on Dec. 7, 1913. His family transferred to Chicago when he was still two years old. At the age of nine, John lost his sight. In his early musical career, he backed up Merline Johnson. When he reached his mid-twenties, John became a reliable and famous accompanying pianist. He also recorded music of his own and sang with his lightweight voice.  When he toured Europe in 1952, he was the first African American blues pianist to do so. He enjoyed a higher profile in Europe than in the United States. Born blind at birth and in a family of enslaved people, Tom Wiggins was sold as an infant with his parents in 1850.  Their buyer advocates secession and a newspaper editor in the South. If his historical accounts are accurate, Tom will be regarded today as an autistic savant. He had terrific abilities that no ordinary man could do. Tom was able to memorize entire musical compositions and conversations. He can repeat what he heard verbatim after hearing it only once. Blind Tom was the stage name of Thomas Greene Wiggins. Many musical authorities consider him a pianist with fantastic skill, incredible memory, and expressive playing. During his time, however, he was still regarded as lesser than humans and nearer to animals. As such, he and his musical talents were exploited by his white enslavers for their financial gains. John Bethune, one of his owners, made a fortune by displaying Tom\u2019s unique abilities on tours around the United States at that time. Matthew Whitaker is another black and blind pianist worthy of inclusion on our list. He is still young, age 20, but he was also born blind. His birthplace was in Hackensack, New Jersey. Matthew has already shown his potential as a piano virtuoso at an early age. When he was ten, he performed the opening number for Stevie Wonder\u2019s induction into the Hall of Fame at the Apollo Theater. Stevie is one of their musical idols of Matthew. They share the same style of piano playing. Matthew has already performed at Carnegie Hall, aside from other major venues around the country. Plus, he has displayed excellent techniques both on the piano and the organ. He also performs very well. Lastly, he has taken to the stage more naturally than other performers. Most of us have assumed that of all the famous blind pianists we know, only two are black. Now you know that there are more. Perhaps you still have some questions about this topic that are left unanswered. If you keep on reading, you might find your answers below: By the latest count, who is the most famous black and blind pianist in America? If you include the living and the dead, we have seven black and blind African American famous pianists. They are the following: The living pianists on the list are Stevie Wonder, Marcus Roberts, and Matthew Whitaker. All the rest, including Ray Charles, Art Tatum, Blind John Davis, and Tom Wiggins, have already left this world. Almost all of the pianists included in the above list are self-taught, except Ray Charles and Matthew Whitaker. To make a list of the world\u2019s most renowned blind black piano players, you should include the following names: Of all the seven pianists listed above, only Stevie Wonder, Matthew Whitaker, and Marcus Roberts are actively pursuing their musical careers. The rest, including Ray Charles, Art Tatum, Blind John Davis, and Tom Wiggins, have already gone to their resting places.

Here are the reasons piano black trim needs to be banished from car interiors. There\u2019s plenty to criticise today\u2019s car designs for, from oversized grilles to overstyled side detailing and the lack of interior and exterior colour choices. There\u2019s one design aspect, however, that is so breathtakingly cynical and so fundamentally flawed it beggars belief so many car companies employ it. It\u2019s piano black trim. We know exactly why automakers use it. They debut a new vehicle and release a press kit full of beautiful, high-quality images to show it off.  Everything looks so neat and modern and shiny, and that applies not only to the exterior with its en vogue LED lighting and exaggerated grille, but also the interior. To give that fresh, modern effect, they use gloss or piano black trim. Plain grey plastic can look a bit old, unfinished and cheap, while that satin metal-look plastic\u2019s heyday was definitely the 2000s and woodgrain is a bit 1990s. Piano black trim is a nice glossy surface and its smoothness affords some contrast with the graining of plastic and leather. What a pity, then, that it looks like absolute rubbish as soon as it rolls out of that photo shoot. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s more predisposed to getting dusty than any other type of trim, it\u2019s that dust \u2013 typically being lighter in colour \u2013 contrasts so vividly with glossy black material. Then come the fingerprints! Nothing smudges like piano black trim. Say what you will about plain grey plastic or metal-look trim, but these materials rarely require you to carry around a microfibre cloth just to keep your car\u2019s interior looking presentable on a daily basis. There\u2019s a third type of disturbance, however, that comes with the use of piano black trim. As I write this, I have a Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross Exceed Plug-In Hybrid in my parking space. The interior isn\u2019t my favourite in the small SUV segment \u2013 there\u2019s some naff carbon fibre-looking trim and some rather cheap \u201cmetal-look\u201d plastic, but these help afford some contrast in an otherwise entirely black interior.  And if you look at the dashboard photo above, it all looks pretty nice in a professional photograph. Peer closer, however, and you\u2019ll see why the piano black trim used on the centre console is so offensive. With only around 7000km on the odometer, the Eclipse Cross\u2019s piano black trim is already scratched and scuffed to hell. It\u2019s one thing to put the stuff on parts of the dashboard that you\u2019re unlikely to touch, but it\u2019s another to put it on the heavily trafficked centre console.  Not that you should have to gingerly handle things in your own car \u2013 unless you\u2019re Edward Scissorhands, you\u2019re surely not going to go about clumsily scratching your car\u2019s interior.  We know press cars can be abused, but we\u2019re talking about a car that\u2019s been on a press fleet for only a few months and its centre console already looks beat to hell. Not only is piano black trim highly impractical, it\u2019s also unimaginative. Virtually every manufacturer, from Audi to Kia to Volvo, offers it on multiple models. It\u2019s also, in my view, pretty boring.  There\u2019s no graining to it so there\u2019s no visual complexity, nor is there any tactility. It\u2019s just shiny black plastic. Even a dark stained wood with a glossy finish would be preferable as there\u2019d be some substance to it, even if it was just as likely to attract smudges. We\u2019ll admit it sometimes can be visually impressive. Take, for instance, the redesigned Hyundai Tucson, with its flowing centre stack where everything is flush and shiny. But that particular model brings up another bugbear \u2013 touch-capacitive switchgear with no haptic feedback \u2013 so it\u2019s hardly the best example of thoughtful design, even if it is pretty. Not only is piano black trim overused, prone to getting dirty, and susceptible to scratches, you\u2019re often stuck with it as it\u2019s the only trim option available.  It\u2019s tolerable when it\u2019s used as some accenting around centre stack switches, where it\u2019ll attract dust but it\u2019s less likely to be smudged, but it\u2019s absurd to slather it across the dashboard and, even more egregiously, the centre console. Carmakers, I implore you: move on from this fad. There has to be another trim option out there that still looks fashionable and contemporary in press photos but won\u2019t look horrendous within days (even hours!) of use.

While the color can be quite striking, it can also be difficult to achieve a perfect finish. Here are a few tips on how to paint a piano gloss black:  1. Start with a clean, dry piano. Make sure to remove all dust and dirt from the surface before beginning to paint.  2. Use a high-quality paintbrush or roller to apply the paint evenly.  3. Allow the first coat of paint to dry completely before applying a second coat.  4. Once the second coat is dry, buff the surface with a soft cloth to create a smooth, glossy finish. I haven\u2019t had much time to work on the piano project in the last few months. Painting a piano black was one of the most terrifying and rewarding experiences of my life. In some of my content, I include affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of them, I will earn a commission. The majority of time spent preparing is spent in the classroom. I believe I\u2019ve taped off a few of the best true crime podcasts you\u2019ve heard. It is stated that no sanding is required in Rustoleum Milk Paint. I\u2019m always skeptical when it comes to the instructions. I\u2019d suggest getting involved in some way. It\u2019s exciting to try new things and to face new challenges. A piano black finish is a type of lacquer that is applied to the surface of a piano to create a high-gloss, reflective finish. The lacquer is made from a mixture of nitrocellulose and polymer resins, and is applied in a series of thin coats. Once the final coat is applied, the piano is then buffed and polished to create the desired shine. To achieve the best piano black, a precision process must be followed. As if to catch any minor imperfections, the piano replicates a mirror. The qualities of reflective wear represent the company\u2019s ability to innovate and produce high-quality goods. When the mirror finish is finished, the grooves, gouges, scratches, or scraped will be easily visible. Regardless of the fact that a finished surface is placed in a dust-free, properly ventilated room, there is no such thing as a perfect finish. You will have a shiny finish but not the smoothness of a mirror after it has been sprayed out of the gun. The only way to ensure that light reflects perfectly is to level or sand the finish until all of the layers are smooth. Despite the fact that the current economic climate has brought significant challenges to the piano industry, the retail and manufacturing sectors have remained robust. Despite the strong demand for pianos, piano makers have had difficulty satisfying consumer demand. An overheated piano key causes the key to become depressed and fails to return to its normal position in a timely manner, hence the term\u2019sticking key.\u2019 Yamaha\u2019s grand pianos come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The manufacture of silent and quiet pianos has grown in recent years. It was a popular theme in the last year to spotlight quieter systems. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m standing in a crowd again, a year after I was at the NAMM show. When used as a coat of paint, a coat of paint can transform even the ugliest of furniture into a work of art. Paint can make a room feel its best, whether it\u2019s a piano that\u2019s been sitting on the corner for years, or a battered and nearly forgotten dresser.  Northern Engraving\u2019s piano black finish is achieved by priming, spraying, and applying polyurethane over multiple coats. The finished piece gleams with a glossy, lustrous sheen, making it the ideal finishing touch for any room in the house.  If you don\u2019t have access to a spray gun or want to save time, you can also use traditional paint techniques to make a piano black. The result will be a stunning, shiny work of art that will only take a few hours to complete. If you do not want your piano to look brand new, replace it with one. What type of paint do I use on a piano? Pianos can be painted in a variety of colors. Because the paint is less abrasive, you can use chalk paint on it. Because there are more colors to choose from, I chose a Behr satin finish paint, which is a standard latex paint. My fondest childhood memory was spending time on the piano with my family. I always knew I wanted one in my home, so I started looking for one on Facebook marketplaces. This is the step-by-step procedure for painting a piano that I\u2019ll show you in today\u2019s article. If your piano\u2019s surface has been finished, sanding it off will give you the best results. Tape plastic sheeting over the inside of the piano if the inside parts are exposed to the outside, in addition to taping plastic sheets over the inside. Painting a piano is an excellent way to bring a classic instrument to life. Tape off the keys and pedals on your piano to make it easier to paint it. After that, you will be able to paint. You should sand the paint in between coats. After selecting your favorite bright color, apply it with a foam brush to smooth it out. Piano black paint code refers to a type of black paint that is specifically designed for pianos. This paint is made to resist scratches and other damage that can be caused by pianos. A high gloss piano finish is a type of finish that is applied to pianos in order to create a shiny, mirror-like surface. This type of finish is typically achieved by using a high-gloss lacquer or varnish, and it can be applied to both the exterior and interior of a piano. A high gloss piano finish is typically very durable and resistant to scratches and fingerprints, making it ideal for pianos that are frequently played or are located in high-traffic areas. After using epoxy with non-blistering hardeners, it was determined that cycloaliphatic epoxy epoxy would work well as a fill coat. Before you begin the first coat, preheat your crosses under a heater to remove any air or moisture. Spraying with a good automotive two-part urethane is all that is required. I used catalyzed lacquer and conversion varnish for finishing furniture in the past, but now they\u2019re a lot less expensive. To remove swirl marks from 1000, wet sand it with medium-cut buffing compound before using machine glaze / swirl mark remover. It is critical to harden with heat. There isn\u2019t even a chance of wet sanding 600 because the scratches are too difficult to remove. A high gloss finish is the most commonly used on new pianos. They create a smooth, reflective surface by using polyester, lacquer, or shellac. The piano will appear less shiny if the finish is not flat; if it is not flat, the light will diffuse and diffuse. The satin finish is less common, but it provides a more refined appearance. Because the finish is less polyester or lacquer, it is lighter and has a sheen. The colors in these finishes do not appear as vibrant as high gloss finishes because they are less reflective. Piano black is a finish that is typically applied to MDF, or medium-density fiberboard. This type of finish is achieved by applying a black paint to the MDF and then buffing it to a high shine. Piano black is a popular finish for furniture and cabinets because it has a sleek, modern look. A MDF finish that is black and glossy is likely to work well with the piano. It has been done with composite materials, which are similar to speaker cabinets and are very similar to how they look. The primary issue is the wood\u2019s porous nature, which needs to be addressed first. Since your outfit is going black, I\u2019d suggest using the PPG DP90. You should only use a few coats of black if you are doing foundation prep. When using a good urethane sealer, it is possible to save a few coats of paint. The color of your suit is black, so I\u2019d use a PPG DP90 in place of it. The most difficult aspect is wood\u2019s porous nature. Many speaker companies cover their speakers with black socks, which you will not see in the photos, and prices rise as a result. The catalized finish would be a safer option for you. If you want to make your MDF sweet, make sure you fill it completely in and even bond the edges. I would first coat the MDF with resin, then tint polyester resin, sand, and finally coat it with black gloss lacquer. Lacquer is less durable than modern urethanes (single stage and two stage). A single stage can be easier to repair when you spot the problem (for example, on the 1/4 panel of a car). Lacquer is far less durable than modern urethanes (single stage and 2-stage). After 8000 grit of wet sanding (micromesh) is applied, it becomes very glossy; after 12,000 grit is applied, a 6 pack is used to achieve the same result. Because automotive finishes are more forgiving and durable than non-powered finishes, they are a good choice for those who are not as skilled. The only thing you can do is get your foundation right, not how many coats you apply of black. If you buy all of the supplies from the same MFG, you won\u2019t have to worry about peeling them. When you paint dewaxed shellac on bare wood, you can expect to see a glass-like finish. There is some epoxy on restaurant tabletops and bartops that has the appearance of wet epoxy. If you want to achieve a smooth glossy finish, you can do it with a roller or a brush, but you should do a lot of sanding. It takes a million coats of poly to make it smooth without the need for sand. When using a 400 grit sandpaper, make sure to lightly wet sand between coats to make the surface smoother. It comes in 200, 400, and 600 grain sizes and is black in color. This paper can be used to apply a thin layer of sand to the surface and then lightly sand it all over again while keeping it wet. The finish is finished with a high-gloss black sealer. This can be purchased from specialty suppliers. After applying a thin coat of paint, let it dry. To achieve a glossy finish, apply a finishing touch with a sanding block. In decorative trim, it is a stylish option to consider using the smooth lustrous finish found on the finest grand pianos when decorating your luxury vehicle. The gloss black finish on aluminum is created using traditional decorating techniques. This is a very good article about how to apply a black finish to a wooden piano. A few different tools and supplies can be used to complete the project. The article includes useful photos that can assist you in completing the task. The piano black is a high-gloss black that is extremely popular in the automotive, telecommunications, and computer industries. The most common use of this product is in conjunction with low-gloss black as a contrast or for chrome details. The cost of painting a piano can vary greatly, depending on the scope of the job and the type of piano. On a grand piano, refinishing typically costs between $1500 and $7500+, but an even more extensive job requiring extensive restoration may cost in excess of $10,000. The cost of painting a piano can be influenced by a number of factors, including the type of piano, the location of the piano, and its condition. Piano black lacquer is a notoriously difficult finish to refinish. The high-gloss finish is easily marred by even the smallest imperfections, and any sort of repair work is very difficult to blend in. For these reasons, many piano black lacquer finishes are simply replaced rather than refinished. A piano is an investment that can be more expensive than a car, and it must be tuned on a regular basis. Even if you have scratches on the black lacquer surface of a piano, you can easily fix them. The owner will save thousands of dollars if he repairs lacquer scratches themselves. To make the new lacquer, combine two parts lacquer and one part thinner. Wait five minutes after applying the lacquer to the damaged area before beginning. Using a cotton rag, rubbing the surface with 4F pumice, and rubbing water into it as a lubricant, Polish it. Refinishing your piano can be a very rewarding experience, giving it a luxurious and expensive finish. Lacquer in black finishes is a traditional and elegant finish that can be applied with a few coats of lacquer. Lacquer should be applied lightly, as excessive application can cause scratches and other damage. Peter Williams is a graduate of B.A Arts and Culture from the University of Technology Sydney.

Born into a Sikh family, Sundar grew up a faithful Sikh. When a boy, he converted to Christianity, incurring the rejection by his father. Sundar withdrew from a Christian seminary after refusing to cast off his Sikh clothing and wear Western clothing. That set the direction of his ministry, seeking to wear the clothing and speak the terminology of the Sikh while conveying the Christian message. Sundar's impact went far and wide, influencing important spiritual leaders, such as Mahatma Ghandi and C.S. Lewis. He is believed to have died in the foothills of the Himalayas in 1929, although his body was never found.\n The international Christian missionary press focused upon Sundar Singh's Christian message, even giving some attention to the Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist terminology. His universalism message though received little or no attention from the missionary Christian community. His writings were widely published, revealing his view that so-called heathen Hindus, Buddhists, and Sikhs will go to heaven as surely as a faithful Christian. Sundar, reflecting on an international trip he made to the West during the 1920s, shared his view that many more Indian and Asian people have profound faith than those in the West.[1]\n During Sundar's lifetime, Great Britain ruled India, but he paid little attention to that political situation. He focused his mission on reaching Indian and Tibetan people with the life example and message of Jesus Christ. Reflecting on his way of life, the thought presents that if Jesus Christ could have sent his disciples to India during Jesus' lifetime, they would have lived and worked as Sadhu Sundar Singh had. His life displayed how the lifestyle and message of the New Testament can integrate seamlessly into the life style of a Sikh, Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist holy person.\n Sundar Singh had been born into an important landowning Sikh family in Patiala State in northern India. Sikhs, rejecting Hindu polytheism and Muslim intolerance in the sixteenth century, had become a vigorous nation with a religion of their own. Sundar Singh's mother took him weekly to sit at the feet of a Sadhu, an ascetic holy man, who lived in the jungle some miles away. She also sent him to a Christian mission school where he could learn English.\n The death of Sundar Singh's mother, when he was fourteen years old, plunged him into violence and despair. He turned on the missionaries, persecuted their Christian converts, and ridiculed their faith. In final defiance of their religion, he bought a Bible and burned it page by page in his home compound while his friends watched. Three nights later he went to his room, determining to commit suicide on a railway line.\n Background\nChristianity\nThomas the Apostle\nPantaenus\nProtestantism\nIndian history\nMissions timeline\nChristianity in India\n People\nBartholom\u00e4us Ziegenbalg\nJoshua Marshman\nWilliam Ward\nAlexander Duff\nAnthony Norris Groves\nAmy Carmichael\nE.

David\nMahakavi K.V. Simon\nP. C. John \nRavi Zacharias\n Before dawn, he wakened his father to announce that he had seen Jesus Christ in a vision and heard his voice. Henceforth, he would follow Christ forever, he declared. Still only fifteen, he utterly committed himself to Christ and for the next twenty-five years of his life he witness extensively to Jesus Christ. His father pleaded and demanded that he give up his conviction. When he refused, Sher Singh gave a farewell feast for his son, then denounced him and expelled him from the family. Several hours later, Sundar realized that his food had been poisoned. A nearby Christian community helped him, saving his life.[2]\n On his sixteenth birthday, he participated in a public Christian baptism at the parish church in Simla, a town high in the Himalayan foothills. For some time previously he had been staying at the Christian Leprosy Home at Sabathu, not far from Simla, serving the leprosy patients there. It was to remain one of his most beloved bases and he returned there after his baptism.\n In October 1906, he set out walking a road, wearing a yellow robe and turban. The yellow robe designated the \"uniform\" of a Hindu sadhu, traditionally an ascetic devoted to the gods, who either begged his way along the roads or sat, silent, remote, and often filthy, meditating in the jungle or some lonely place. The young Sundar Singh had also chosen the sadhu's way, as a Christian.\n I am not worthy to follow in the steps of my Lord,\" he is recorded as saying, \"but, like Him, I want no home, no possessions. Like Him I will belong to the road, sharing the suffering of my people, eating with those who will give me shelter, and telling all men of the love of God.[3]\n He at once put his vocation to the test by going back to his home village, Rampur, where he received an unexpectedly warm welcome. The sixteen year old Sadhu set out northward through the Punjab, over the Bannihal Pass into Kashmir, then back through Muslim Afghanistan, and finally into the brigand-infested North-West Frontier and Baluchistan. His thin, yellow robe gave him little protection against the snows, and his feet became torn from the rough tracks.\n After a few months had passed, the small Christian communities of the north referred to him as \"the apostle with the bleeding feet.\"[4] From the villages in the Simla hills, he faced the long line of the snow-clad Himalayas, and the rosy peak of Nanga Parbat. Beyond them lay Tibet, a Buddhist land that missionaries had long failed to penetrate with the gospel. Sundar had felt called to Tibet, and in 1908, at the age of nineteen, he crossed its frontiers for the first time. He encountered poverty and unsanitary conditions far worse than his native home. Sundar went back to Sabathu determined to return the next year.\n He had a great desire: To visit Palestine and re-live some of the experiences in Jesus's life. In 1908, he went to Bombay, hoping to board a convenient ship, but failing to receive a permit from the government, he returned to the north.\n In December 1909, he began training for the Christian ministry at the Anglican college in Lahore. He refrained from forming relationships with fellow students, meeting them at meal times and designated prayer sessions. From the beginning he found himself tormented by fellow students for being \"different.\" Although Singh had been baptized Anglican, he had never learned the teachings and traditions of Anglicanism. His inability to adapt to Anglican life hindered him from fitting in with the routines of academic study. Much in the college course seemed to Singh irrelevant to the gospel as India needed to hear it. In July 1910, after eight months in the college, Singh decided to leave the seminary.\n Singh's withdrawal from ministry training may have been due to remarks made by Bishop Lefroy about the requirements of an ordained Anglican priest. Singh had been told he must discard his sadhu's robe and wear \"respectable\" European clerical dress, use formal Anglican worship, sing English hymns, and never preach outside his parish without special permission. Never again visit Tibet, he asked? That would be, to him, an unthinkable rejection of God's call. He left the college, still dressed in his yellow robe, and in 1912, began his annual trek into Tibet as the winter snows began to melt on the Himalayan tracks and passes.\n In 1912, Sadhu returned with an extraordinary account of finding a three-hundred-year old Christian hermit in a mountain cave-the Maharishi of Kailas, with whom he spent some weeks in deep fellowship. According to Singh, in a town called Rasar, he had been thrown in a dry well full of bones and rotting flesh and left to die. Three days later, a rope descended to him and climbed out to safety.[5] Another time, Singh reported having been rescued by members of the \"Sunnyasi Mission,\" secret disciples of Jesus wearing their Hindu markings, whom he claimed to have found all over India.[6] Legend traces the origins of that brotherhood to one of the Magi at Christ's Nativity and then the second century C.E. disciples of the apostle Thomas circulating in India. The fellowship came to light after William Carey began his missionary work in Serampore. The Maharishi of Kailas experienced ecstatic visions about the secret fellowship that he retold to Sundar Singh, and Singh himself built his spiritual life around visions.[7] Since Singh never keep a diary, and he traveled alone, his success at wining disciples during the hazardous annual Tibetan treks remains unknown.\n In his twenties, Sundar Singh's ministry expanded. His name and picture became familiar throughout the Christian world. He described in terms of a vision a struggle with Satan to retain his humility but, in fact, he had been typically humane, approachable, and humble, with a sense of fun and a love of nature. That, with his \"illustrations\" from ordinary life, gave his addresses great impact. His talks and his personal speech sprang out of profound early morning meditation, especially on the Gospels. In 1918, he made a long tour of South India and Ceylon, and the following year he visited Burma, Malaya, China, and Japan.\n One of the stories from those tours related that he had Christ-given power over wild animals, like the leopard which crept up to him while he stood praying and crouched as he fondled its head, and over evil, typified by the sorcerer who tried to hypnotize him in a railway-carriage and blamed the Bible in the sadhu's pocket for his failure. He claimed even to have power over disease and illness, though he never publicized his gift.\n Sundar Singh had been a Christian universalist; he believed that all people would, eventually, attain salvation. Writing in 1925 he argued:\n If the Divine spark in the soul cannot be destroyed, then we need despair of no sinner\u2026 Since God created men to have fellowship with Himself, they cannot for ever be separated from Him\u2026 After long wandering, and by devious paths, sinful man will at last return to Him in whose Image he was created; for this is his final destiny.[8]\n In 1929, before his final mission, some theology students in Calcutta asked him about the doctrine of eternal punishment. He said: \"There was punishment, but it was not eternal,\" and that \"Everyone after this life would be given a fair chance of making good, and attaining to the measure of fullness the soul was capable of. This might sometimes take ages.\"[8]\n For years, Sundar Singh had wanted to visit Britain. He decided to go when his father, Sher Singh, came to tell him that he too had become a Christian, wishing to pay for his trip to Britain. He visited the West twice, traveling to Britain, the United States, and Australia in 1920, and to Europe again in 1922. Christians of many traditions welcomed him, his words touched the hearts of people dealt with despair in aftermath of World War I. Sundar felt appalled by the materialism, emptiness, and irreligion he found, contrasting it with Asia's awareness of God. Once back in India, he continued his ministry, though his health began to fail.\n In 1923, Sundar Singh made the last of his regular summer visits to Tibet and came back exhausted. His preaching journeys concluded, during the following years, he gave himself to meditation, fellowship, and writing in his own home or those of his friends in the Simla hills.\n In 1929, Sundar determined to make one last journey to Tibet. In April he reached Kalka, a small town below Simla, a prematurely aged figure in his yellow robe among pilgrims and holy men beginning their own trek to one of Hinduism's holy places some miles away. Where he went after that remains unknown. Whether he fell from a precipitous path, died of exhaustion, or reached the mountains, will remain a mystery. Sundar Singh had been seen for the last time. His memory remains as one of the most treasured and formative figures in the development and story of Christ's church in India.\n \nSeveral biographies have been written about Sundar Singh which emphasize his piety, humility and Christian witness. Eric Sharpe surveyed the biographical studies of Sundar Singh and discerned a number of significant discrepancies in chronological details, in the accounts of his Christian conversion, and the accounts of his travels to Tibet. Sharpe indicates that writers in continental Europe, England and the United States of America constructed different portraits of Sundar Singh. He argues that the different portraits disclose much about the way Westerners thought about India in the 1920s and 1930s. Sharpe remarks:  When in the spring of 1920 an Oxford don and his young Indian tutee conceived the idea of writing a book about Sadhu Sundar Singh, it was in their minds to interpret him to the West in terms that the West could grasp and according to a scale of values that the West could affirm.[9] \nSharpe pointed to significant omissions of detail between the biographies of A.J. Appasamy, B.H. Streeter, Janet Lynch-Watson, Cyril J. Davey and Phyllis Thompson. Perhaps the most glaring differences concerns the influence of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1782) and Swedenborgian writers on Sadhu Sundar Singh. Sharpe refers to correspondence between Singh and A.E. Penn, the secretary of the Indian Swedenborgian society, in which Singh stated that he had contacted Swedenborg in the spirit world: \"I saw him several times some years ago, but I did not know his earthly name. His name in the spiritual world is quite different just according to his high position or office and most beautiful character.\"[10] Sharpe also refers back to Singh's endorsement of Swedenborg as recorded by Appasamy:  Swedenborg was a great man, philosopher, scientist, and, above all, seer of clear visions. I often speak with him in my visions. He occupies a high place in the spiritual world \u2026 Having read his books and having come into contact with him in the spiritual world, I can thoroughly recommend him as a great seer.[11] Sundar Singh's correspondence with the Swedish Lutheran bishop Nathan Soderblom in November 1928 further confirms that he claimed visionary contact with Swedenborg.\n For western evangelical Christians, Swedenborg has long been regarded as an unorthodox teacher. Some, such as the Christian apologist Walter Martin, have classified Swedenborg and his followers among the cults.[12] In light of the evangelical rejection of Swedenborg's theology, the omission of Sundar Singh's endorsement of Swedenborg's teachings from evangelical biographies has significance. Singh's confirmation of contact with Swedenborg in the spirit world compounds the difficulty for evangelicals. That visionary form of contact with an unorthodox deceased teacher clashes with the portraits of piety drawn by later evangelical biographers such as Cyril Davey and Phyllis Thompson.\n The results of Sharpe's survey of the various biographies, articles published in Indian and European periodicals, and the extant correspondence of Sundar Singh's, discloses a complex web of western images that portray Singh in contradictory ways: Evangelical missionary, ecstatic visionary, and ascetic pilgrim. Sharpe stated: \"It is time to rescue his memory from oblivion on the one hand and romantic adulation on the other, to protect him from a few of his patrons, and give him his rightful place among those of whom he himself wrote.\"[13]\n As a Christian witness, he had been rejected as well as welcomed, persecuted, and even left for dead. By many missionaries, and even Indian Christian leaders, he had been regarded as a highly eccentric convert, totally out of step with contemporary Christianity as he wandered the roads in his yellow robe and turban. Some of his biographers estimate that, even though he never heard the later vogue-word \"indigenization,\" he had done more than any man in the first half of the twentieth century to establish that \"Jesus belongs to India.\" He made it clear that Christianity constitutes not an imported, alien, foreign religion but is indigenous to Indian needs, aspirations, and faith. He remains one of the permanently significant figures of Indian Christianity.\n All links retrieved August 31, 2019.\n New World Encyclopedia writers and editors rewrote and completed the Wikipedia article\nin accordance with New World Encyclopedia standards.

Narendra Damodardas Modi He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Modi is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. He is the first prime minister outside of the Indian National Congress to win two consecutive terms with a full majority and the second to complete five years in office after Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Born to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child and has said he later ran his own stall. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. Modi left home after finishing high-school in part due to an arranged marriage to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, which he abandoned and publicly acknowledged only many decades later. Modi travelled around India for two years and visited a number of religious centres before returning to Gujarat. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary. Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots, or otherwise criticized for its handling of it. A Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally. His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise. His administration has been criticized for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state. Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the Indian lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy; he has centralized power by abolishing the Planning Commission. He began a high-profile sanitation campaign and weakened or abolished environmental and labor laws. He initiated a controversial demonetization of high-denomination banknotes. Following his party's victory in the 2019 general election, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. His administration also introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, which resulted in widespread protests across the country. Described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda. \u00a0 Full Name: Narendra Damodardas Modi Height: 1.7 m 14th Prime Minister of India (From 26 May 2014) 14th Chief Minister: of Gujarat (7 October 2001 \u2013 22 May 2014) Member of Parliament: Lok Sabha (From 5 June 2014) Preceded By: Murli Manohar Joshi Constituency: Varanasi Member: Gujarat Legislative Assembly (1 January 2002 \u2013 16 May 2014) Preceded By: Kamlesh Patel Succeeded By Suresh Patel Constituency: Maninagar Born: Narendra Damodardas Modi (17 September 1950 (age 69)) Vadnagar, Bombay State, India\n(present-day Gujarat) Political Party: Bharatiya Janata Party Affiliations: National Democratic Alliance Spouse(s): Jashodaben Modi (m. 1968; estranged) Residence: 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, New Delhi, Delhi, India Alma Mater: University of Delhi (BA), Gujarat University (MA), School of Open Learning, University of Delhi Net Worth: 2.5 Crore Official: Website Social Network: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube \u00a0 Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915\u20131989) and Hiraben Modi (born c. 1920). Modi's family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community, which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government. As a child, Modi helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and said that he later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus. Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, with interest in theatre. Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and his teachers and students noted this. Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image. When eight years old, Modi discovered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor. While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980. Also in Narendra Modi's childhood, in a custom traditional to his caste, his family arranged a betrothal to a girl, Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when they were teenagers. Sometime thereafter, he abandoned the further marital obligations implicit in the custom, and left home, the couple going on to lead separate lives, neither marrying again, and the marriage itself remaining unmentioned in Modi's public pronouncements for many decades. In April 2014, shortly before the national elections that swept him to power, Modi publicly affirmed that he was married and his spouse was Jashodaben; the couple has remained married, but estranged. Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he went have emerged. In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education. Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi's life. In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which Modi wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati. Modi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968\u201369. Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad. There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation. In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city. After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS,[46] working under Inamdar. Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him. Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001. In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from School of Open Learning at University of Delhi, graduating with a third class. Five years later, in 1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class as an external distance learning student. \u00a0 \u00a0 In accordance with Ghanchi tradition, Modi's marriage was arranged by his parents when he was a child. He was engaged at age 13 to Jashodaben, marrying her when he was 18. They spent little time together and grew apart when Modi began two years of travel, including visits to Hindu ashrams. Reportedly, their marriage was never consummated, and he kept it a secret because otherwise he could not have become a 'pracharak' in the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Modi kept his marriage secret for most of his career. He acknowledged his wife for the first time when he filed his nomination for the 2014 general elections. Modi maintains a close relationship with his mother, Hiraben. A vegetarian and teetotaler, Modi has a frugal lifestyle and is a workaholic and introvert. Modi's 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with citizens on a live chat. Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, as well as for a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. Modi's personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic. He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji (\"Guru worthy of worship\"). According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children. The nomination of Modi for the prime ministership drew attention to his reputation as \"one of contemporary India's most controversial and divisive politicians.\" During the 2014 election campaign the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader, who would be able to take difficult decisions. Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, in a manner unusual for the BJP and RSS. Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and \"development\". Nonetheless, his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy. Modi's hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a9 2022 Wishusucess"], "https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/how-to-use-collab-cam-as-a-secondary-camera": [" \n                            Streaming \n \n                            Platforms \n \n                            Desktop \n \n                            Tools \n \n                            Widgets \n \n                            Help Center \n \n                            University \n streamlabs.com \nStreaming\n                                     \nPlatforms\n                                     \nDesktop\n                                     \nTools\n                                     \nWidgets\n                                     \nHelp Center\n                                     \nUniversity\n                                     How to Use Collab Cam as a Secondary Camera (and 8 Ideas for Fun Streams!)  5 min read  Sep 22, 2022 \n                Newsflash\u2014Collab Cam isn\u2019t only for adding a guest to your live stream, you can use it to set up a secondary camera to make your live stream just a tad bit more interesting.\n             Mika Robinson Last Updated on September 27, 2022 It goes without saying that the best streamers continue to find ways to make their content more engaging for their audience.

(1867/68-1917) Best known for: status as a ragtime icon and for creating the ice cream truck song Scott Joplin is best known for his ragtime masterpieces \u201cMaple Leaf Rag\u201d and \u201cThe Entertainer\u201d (a.k.a. the ice cream truck song). Joplin\u2019s birthplace is contested, but he\u2019s believed to have grown up in Texarkana, a town that straddles the Texas and Arkansas border. The young Joplin got his start on piano by playing one in his mother\u2019s employer\u2019s home. He would later study with Julius Weiss, who jump-started his interest in European classical music and opera. Joplin made a career out of playing at social clubs and publishing sheet music, but his finances were sometimes unstable. He worked for years on his opera Treemonisha but didn\u2019t live to see it performed. In the 1970s, there was a revived interest in ragtime and in Joplin\u2019s music. Treemonisha finally premiered in Atlanta in 1972. Sources and more info: (1875-1912) Best known for: compositions that gave him the nickname \u201cBlack Mahler\u201d Samuel Coleridge-Taylor is better known as a composer and as a violinist rather than a pianist. But the British composer sometimes dubbed \u201cBlack Mahler\u201d did make gorgeous contributions to piano such as Forest Scenes and the Valse Suite for Piano. He also transcribed 24 Negro Melodies for the piano. Coleridge-Taylor identified as Anglo-African. His mother was British and his father, who taught him how to play the violin, was from Sierra Leone. Coleridge-Taylor was also a fan of poetry, and his cantata trilogy The Song of Hiawatha was based on a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Despite the racism of the day, Coleridge-Taylor\u2019s music was well-received and he was even invited to the White House by Theodore Roosevelt. Sources and more info: (1887-1953) Best known for: being the first Black woman to have a symphony played by a major American orchestra Florence Price was the first Black woman composer to have a symphony played by a major national orchestra. Her Symphony No. 1 debuted with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1933. But while this inaugural performance gave her career an instant boost, Price would continue struggling for recognition. She once wrote: \u201cI have two handicaps. I am a woman and I have some Negro blood in my veins.\u201d Nevertheless, Price\u2019s career is nothing short of impressive. Nurtured by her mother, she gave her first recital at age four and graduated high school at age 14 as valedictorian. At 16, Price entered the New England Conservatory and double-majored in piano and organ. Today, concert pianist and academic Dr. Karen Walwyn is working on preserving Price\u2019s legacy by recording her works and sharing her achievements on florenceprice.com. Sources and more info: \ud83d\udcdc ABOUT BLACK HISTORY MONTH: February was chosen as Black History Month because both Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass (historical icons of abolition) were born in February. However, many argue that Black history should be celebrated, shared, and taught year-round. Each year, the Association for the Study of African American Life and History designates a theme for Black History Month. In 2022, the theme is Black Health and Wellness. (1904-1984) Best known for: the Count Basie Orchestra and the Basie Ending Known affectionately as the \u201cKing of Swing,\u201d William \u201cCount\u201d Basie is best known for the bands he led. His mother, a laundress, paid twenty-five cents per piano lesson for young Basie, who later earned back money by accompanying silent films at a local theatre. The Count Basie Orchestra \u2014 perhaps Basie\u2019s most successful ensemble \u2014 was led by the Count for nearly 50 years. In 1958, Basie became the first Black person to win a Grammy Award. He would go on to win nine Grammys in total. Interestingly, Basie originally wanted to become a drummer, but seeing Sonny Greer\u2019s skill level intimidated him and made him \u201cretreat\u201d to the piano. Sources and more info: (1909-1956) Best known for: incredible technical prowess at the piano One of the world\u2019s legendary jazz pianists, Art Tatum was a legally blind prodigy from Toledo, Ohio. He taught himself music by memorizing piano rolls and playing what he heard on the radio.\u00a0 Tatum\u2019s most well-known performance is probably \u201cTea for Time.\u201d His technical virtuosity is otherworldly, with sweeping runs and rich ornamentations, and he\u2019s considered one of the most technically sophisticated pianists of any genre. Tatum rarely composed, but every performance of his can be framed as a composition because they are each so unique. And while Tatum died relatively young at the age of 47, his legacy can still be felt today. For example, the smallest discernible unit of music is called a \u201ctatum\u201d in honor of him. Sources and more info: (1910-1981) Best known for: arranging and composing A prolific arranger and composer, Mary Lou Williams penned over 350 compositions in her lifetime. And while her name isn\u2019t as instantly recognizable as other jazz greats, she\u2019s had a hand in creating them. Her students include Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonius Monk, and more. Williams is perhaps most known for her work with Andy Kirk and His Twelve Clouds of Joy, for which she contributed composing and arranging work along with piano playing. She also helped usher in the genre of bebop. Williams was also known for her deftness at musical notation. Jazz is not an easy genre to write down, but Williams figured out ways to communicate its swing rhythms and occasional dissonance on paper.

This article has been published by\u00a0Diva\u00a0Rai. Table of Contents Closed-Circuit Television(CCTV) Surveillance has become essential for security purposes but at the same time, concerns over the privacy of individuals and groups owing to the nature of its installation and use. When World War II started, security technologies and their applications were still relatively new. Originally, CCTV technology was designed to actually learn about weapons rather than people. At the time, only live streams, not records, could be viewed via CCTV. Since the 1990s, CCTV has been proliferated all over the globe. Today, it is widely used to monitor various aspects of life. It lets individuals keep an eye on everything from workplaces to restaurants, stores, and even their own residences. The use of CCTV has been linked to both a big and little reduction in crime. CCTV is considered to be a form of Situational Crime Prevention (SCP) strategy that increases levels of formal surveillance within a target area. The situational approach to crime prevention concentrates on the area in which crime happens rather than the criminal themselves. CCTV might help to reduce crime by increasing the likelihood of perpetrators being identified and punished. It has the potential to discourage criminals who do not want to be caught. It also assists police and security personnel by alerting them to suspicious activity.\u00a0 The effectiveness of CCTV varies greatly depending on the circumstances. According to the Crime Reduction Toolkit of the College of Policing, CCTV reduces 16 crimes out of 100, and 26 crimes out of 100 for vehicle offenses. In light of all the studies the toolkit consulted, they reasoned that CCTV\u2019s viability depends on how and where it is used.\u00a0\u00a0 In the midst of the beneficial outcomes, a fundamental question has arisen: when does CCTV\u00a0surveillance step over the boundary\u00a0from an effective security instrument to an unlawful invasion of an individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy? A reasonable expectation of privacy refers to areas or components of one\u2019s very own life where a sensible person would expect some degree of privacy.\u00a0 These are a few examples of places where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy: In U.S. v. Vargas the Court\u2019s analysis centered around whether Mr. Vargas had a reasonable expectation of privacy not to have his front yard constantly observed and recorded by a camera with zooming and panning capabilities hidden on a telephone pole over a hundred yards away for six weeks, and whether his subjective expectation of privacy is rationally reasonable. The court ruled that a video surveillance camera focusing on singular\u2019s front yard in a rural location violated his reasonable expectation of privacy. Similarly, in Dr. Fairhurst vs. Woodard, the court ruled that the privacy of a neighbor was \u201cunjustifiably invaded\u201d by security cameras installed in a residence. The security camera was found to monitor practically the whole garden and parking space of Fairhurst in the judgment. Woodard could also watch videos on his phone or wristwatch at any moment. The Claimant was disturbed by Defendant\u2019s apparent contempt for others\u2019 privacy and increased the Claimant\u2019s suspicion. Dr. Faihurst demanded compensatory damages as well as injunctive remedies. This data privacy case of Fairhurst v Woodard adds to the continuing discussion about the mainstream of domestic surveillance, as home surveillance technology has become easily accessibly rising privacy concerns. The general public can now purchase tools that were previously solely available to high-level law authorities and government agents. CCTV has provided individuals and companies with formerly impossible levels of security, but the ease with which security cameras can be installed has also led to considerable abuses. According to cyber law experts, multiple cases of installed CCTV cameras breaching privacy are arising. There have been incidences in which CCTV cameras have captured celebrities and high-profile citizens, and those footage has been sold for money. It is also possible that the data gathered by CCTV cameras will be misused by private companies and organizations for political or terrorist motives, putting public privacy at risk. Modern technology is enhancing efficiency or security at the cost of privacy.\u00a0 The laws governing CCTV surveillance vary widely from country to country. There is a reasonable expectation of privacy in most nations. Like most laws, there are several loopholes and circumstances, but here\u2019s a quick rundown of existing surveillance cameras rules in the global context. Data protection is a basic right\u00a0protected by European law and stated in Article 8 of the European Union\u2019s Charter of Fundamental Rights. CCTV footage in the EU is subjected to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Non-compliance to GDPR can lead to hefty fines. Prior to installing a surveillance camera in the EU, companies should consider the following: In the United Kingdom, CCTV legislation was enacted in 2012, accompanied by a Code of Conduct in 2013. There are three key sections of CCTV legislation of the UK: This act mainly focuses on the citizen\u2019s protection of freedom in the United Kingdom The SCCOP Act is intended to maintain a balance between the requirement for CCTV cameras and the public\u2019s desire for privacy. Individuals have the right to view information stored about them, including CCTV recordings, under the Data Protection Act. The laws governing video surveillance in the USA vary from one state to the next. Installing a residential security camera and recording video is normally lawful in the United States. However, citizens of the United States are guaranteed reasonable expectations of privacy. In States like Alabama, Florida, Kansas; CCTV surveillance in private places is not allowed. As with video surveillance laws, audio recording through security cameras laws also varies from state to state. There are now federal rules in effect regarding audio recording. According to federal law, recording a conversation is permissible as long as one of the parties engaged is aware of it. India, as a developing country, has made significant changes to its information technology rules, yet there are still plenty more to be made. The IT Act of 2000 is the parent legislation governing electronic surveillance. If a camera captures or transmits photos of a person\u2019s private parts, male or female, without consent, the criminal can be charged under Section 66E. The Information Technology Rules, 2021, and the Right to Privacy and Data Protection Bill, 2019 also deal with surveillance. However, there are no detailed guidelines and legislation for CCTV surveillance in India. The Privacy Act, 2018 of Nepal makes it illegal to use CCTV cameras in a way that infringes on people\u2019s privacy. As per the Privacy Rules 2020, information concerning the installation of CCTV cameras for supervising public security and public movement shall be provided to the relevant District Administration Office (DAO). The DAO may appoint an examination and observation team to determine if the companies and individuals operating the CCTV cameras have adhered to legislative requirements. Privacy Rules, 2020 also prohibits the use of CCTV footages for public or commercial purposes. Following the Electronic Transactions Act, anybody who uses a CCTV camera in violation of the law faces legal consequences. If your country does not have any laws regarding CCTV surveillance, you can\u2019t be prosecuted even if you misuse it, right? False. Because there is no legislation, the judge has no set of guidelines to adhere to when ruling over the case. However, each case is treated separately. The judge may still find the acts unreasonable or rule in favor of the victim whose rights were infringed. Countries can introduce CCTV surveillance regulations at any moment, regardless of current laws. So, before you install security cameras, be armed with proper guidelines and know legal limits on CCTV surveillance which will protect you from legal ramifications. As video surveillance varies from one country to another, the requirement of consent for recording videos through CCTV also varies. Consent laws of nations address whether it is allowed to record someone on video or audio without their approval. Usually, consent of one or both parties is required for recording. To comply with GDPR, businesses\u00a0must\u00a0put up signs that are\u00a0clearly visible\u00a0and\u00a0readable\u00a0indicating that\u00a0CCTV is in operation. It is always better to place security cameras where they can be easily seen. A judge is also less likely to accept video evidence obtained from a camera in a private place such as a washroom or a bedroom unless all parties involved are aware that they are being recorded.\u00a0 Consent law and the use of hidden cameras are now hotly debated topics. As mentioned earlier, laws vary by state. Evaluation of the legality of hidden cameras is based on where one resides and how it is being used. Hidden cameras are often not lawful to put in bathrooms or bedrooms where someone is staying, or any other area where people would expect to have a higher degree of privacy.However, having hidden cameras in public spaces such as restaurants, outdoor parks, shopping malls, city streets is normally lawful, but it shouldn\u2019t be used to infringe on the right to privacy. \u00a0Some states in the USA, including California, Georgia, Arkansas, Delaware, Kansas, Utah, Hawaii, South Dakota, etc require employees\u2019 written agreement to have a hidden camera watching them. It is vital to remember that conducting CCTV surveillance through hidden cameras in order to conduct a crime or using the contents to perform blackmail against someone is prohibited. CCTV has evolved into a crime-prevention tool, and the footage captured by security cameras has become an increasingly crucial piece of evidence in court matters. CCTV footage discloses the true nature of the incident and can help identify the offender. However, the audio and video of the footage, or solely video in the case of video-only footage, must pass particular tests in the respective formats to ensure that the electronic evidence, which is the footage, is not tampered with or is authentic. When video surveillance records a crime in a criminal case, the recording must be convincing enough to outweigh whatever rights the accused may have. Ld. Courts have recognized the relevance and value of CCTV in evidence during a trial. The genuineness of CCTV footage was mentioned in Gubinas and Radavicius v HM Advocate, High Court at Aberdeen, Scotland, in Para. 59, it was observed that even if all the witnesses say one thing and CCTV shows something different, the electronic evidence will be relied on rather than the visual field evidence given by the witness. Note: Even if a law enforcement officer requests video footage of your private home security camera, you have the right to say no since recorded images from your home security camera are your private property. Well and selectively operated CCTV surveillance systems are valuable instruments for addressing security challenges; but, poorly configured systems provide a false sense of security while simultaneously invading our privacy and infringing on other fundamental rights. With the advancement of increasingly sophisticated surveillance technologies, comprehensive data protection and privacy law that addresses the loopholes in existing surveillance frameworks must be implemented. Also, an individual\u2019s privacy must be balanced against the public interest and safety. LawSikho has created a telegram group for exchanging legal knowledge, referrals and various opportunities.

Ambedkar National Law University, Sonipat. This article explains the concept and types of evidence as mentioned under the Indian Evidence Act,1872 with special emphasis on secondary evidence and its elements. It also outlines the difference between primary and secondary evidence and the circumstances in which secondary evidence is used in the place of primary evidence.\u00a0 This article has been published by Sneha Mahawar. Table of Contents Evidence forms an integral part of the justice delivery system. It is with the help of the evidence that the alleged facts are proved in a court of law and the right decision is taken. Evidence has been dealt with in detail in the Indian Evidence Act,1872. One of the important forms of evidence mentioned in the Act is secondary evidence which plays a significant role in proving the alleged facts in cases wherein the original document, i.e. the primary evidence is not available due to exceptional circumstances. The Act contains elaborate elements of secondary evidence that outline what forms of documents can fall in this category.\u00a0 The word \u2018evidence\u2019 has been derived from the Latin expression \u2018evidens evidere\u2019 which translates to \u201cto show clearly; to make plain, certain or to prove.\u201d Whenever a case is presented before the court, it has to go through a lot of facts and information given by the contesting parties. A court of law is expected to examine the truth of those facts and deliver justice. This is where the role of \u2018evidence\u2019 comes into the picture. Evidence is that support provided to the facts presented that prove the genuineness of those facts. It is all about giving proof of something before the court.\u00a0 As per Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act,1872, evidence means and includes: Oral evidence basically implies words of mouth that are credible enough to be adequate to prove a particular fact without the support of any documentary evidence. According to Section 60 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, oral evidence must have the following requisites: Though hearsay evidence is not acceptable in a court of law, Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act, which talks about the cases in which a statement of relevant fact by a person who is dead or cannot be found, etc. is relevant, and Section 33 of the same Act which covers relevancy of certain evidence for proving, in the truth of facts that are presented, form the exceptions of this rule.\u00a0 Whenever any evidence is presented to prove certain facts that contain the matter expressed or described upon any material by way of letters, marks, figures, or by more than one such method by which such expression can be made materially, it is called documentary evidence. Thus, it refers to evidence in physical or tangible form.\u00a0 Now as per Section 61 of the Indian Evidence Act, documentary evidence could either be primary or secondary.\u00a0 According to Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, a document refers to \u201cany matter expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures or marks, or by more than one of those means, intended to be used, or which may be used, for the purpose of recording that matter.\u201d Now, this may include printed, lithographed, or photographed words, a map or plan, a caricature, or even an inscription on a metal plate or stone.\u00a0 Section 61 states that the contents of a document can be proved in two ways. They are as follows: According to Section 63, secondary evidence means and includes the following: Section 76 of the Evidence Act describes the certified copies. It lays down that every public officer having the custody of any public document, in relation to which any person has a right to inspect, shall give a copy of that document on demand and on payment of the requisite fee. At the feet of such copy, a certificate must be affixed declaring that it is a true copy of the said copy. The date of the copy, the name and official title of the officer who has subscribed to such copy, and the seal of the officer must also be affixed on that copy. In the case of Kalyan Singh v. Smt. Chhoti and Ors. (1989), it was observed that the genuineness of certified copies that are referred to in Section 63(1) is presumed under Section 79 of the Evidence Act. But this is only for the certified copies. For other copies, proper evidence must be provided to prove it. Thus, the certified copy of a registered sale deed shall be admissible as secondary evidence but not any ordinary copy.\u00a0 For this particular provision, elaborate guidelines were issued in the case of Surinder Kaur v. Mehal Singh (2013). It was observed: This provision is further elaborated by the illustration attached with Section 63. It states that a copy transcribed from a copy is admissible as secondary evidence only when compared with the original. If the copy is not compared with the original, it is not considered to be secondary evidence, even though the copy from which it was transcribed was compared with the original.\u00a0 This provision states that the counterparts of documents are admissible as secondary evidence against the person who had not executed it.\u00a0 Oral accounts of a person about the content of a document must be closely examined. Not examining the informant or not presenting the report of that person is fatal and such a person\u2019s report cannot be relied upon in such a case.\u00a0 Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act enlists the circumstances under which secondary evidence is admissible in place of primary evidence. They are as follows: B.\u00a0 In the case where the contents, existence, or contents of the original document have already been proved to be admitted in writing by the person against whom it is proved or his representative interest. For example, in the case of Sharda Talkies (Firm) and Anr. v. Smt. Madhulata Vyas and Ors. (1995), it was held that in a case where the defendant himself had admitted to having made the payment under the cheque, the absence of the cheque as primary evidence can be dispensed with and this would not vitiate the suit.\u00a0 C. In a situation, wherein the original has been lost or destroyed, or the party who is presenting the evidence cannot present it in reasonable time due to any reason other than his default or neglect;\u00a0 D. In case where the original document is not of such nature that it is not movable so as to be presented before the court for inspection;\u00a0 E. In an instance where the original document is a public document within the meaning of Section 74;\u00a0 F. In a situation where the original is a certified copy that is permitted by this Act or any other law in force in India to be given in evidence;\u00a0 G. In the case where the original consists of numerous accounts or documents which cannot be conveniently all examined by the court, or the fact which is to be proved is the general result of the whole collection.\u00a0 In cases \u2018A\u2019, \u2018C\u2019, and \u2018D\u2019, secondary evidence of the contents of the document is admissible. In the case of \u2018B\u2019, only the written evidence is admissible. In the case of \u2018E\u2019 or \u2018F\u2019, only the certified copy of the document shall be admissible as secondary evidence. Lastly, in the case of \u2018G\u2019, evidence to be presented as the general result of the documents collectively must be given by a person who has examined them and is skilled in the examination of such documents.\u00a0 As per Section 66, in the following circumstances, there is no need to render a notice for the presentation of secondary evidence: The following are some common examples of secondary evidence presented in the courts: Secondary evidence is not considered to be the best form of evidence. It is usually presented in exceptional circumstances where primary evidence is not available. However, this cannot belittle its significance in proving certain facts. There are a number of instances wherein the presence of primary evidence is not possible. In such circumstances, secondary evidence plays a crucial role in proving the facts before a court of law and helps in the delivery of justice. The Indian Evidence Act covers the concept of secondary evidence elaborately, including its meaning, what can be included under it, and when it can be presented in place of primary evidence.\u00a0 Students of\u00a0Lawsikho courses\u00a0regularly produce writing assignments and work on practical exercises as a part of their coursework and develop themselves in real-life practical skills.

She is 70 years old as of 2022. Chimanlal Modi is her father\u2019s name. Ashok Modi and Kamlesh Modi are her two brothers. When she was two years old, her mother died. Jashodaben is of Asian ancestry and holds an Indian nationality. Jashodaben\u2019s marriage was planned by her parents in accordance with Ghanchi tradition. She married India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They got married while her spouse was only 13 years old. They married in 1968, when her spouse was 18 years old. When Modi traveled for two years, including visits to Hindu ashrams, they spent little time together and grew apart. Her marriage was said to have never been consummated, and her husband kept it a secret because he wouldn\u2019t be able to join the Puritan Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as a Pracharak if he did. For the majority of his career, her spouse kept their marriage a secret. When he submitted his nomination for the 2014 legislative elections, he paid tribute to his wife for the first time. Jashodaben has given up teaching and instead devotes his time to prayer. She is protected by a security detail as the prime minister\u2019s wife, but despite initiating litigation against the government, she has not been able to learn what instructions she has or what rights she has in this position. The unusual circumstances of this marriage have been addressed by Indian media and critics in the context of male-female relationships in society. The couple has yet to have a kid. Jashodaben\u2019s career as a teacher has netted her a respectable sum of money. However, her true net worth and salary have yet to be revealed in the media. Jashodaben is a retired teacher who receives a monthly pension of $200. She is undoubtedly benefiting from her husband\u2019s wealth and salary as the wife of the Indian Prime Minister. Narendra Modi, her spouse, earns Rs. 1.6 lakh every month. His base salary will be Rs 50k, with a sumptuary allowance of Rs 3k, a daily allowance of Rs 62k, and a Member of Parliament allowance of Rs 45k. Modi owns Rs 2.5 crore in assets, including a house site in Gandhinagar, India. His exact net worth, however, has yet to be revealed in the media. Jashodaben has a good-looking body. She is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 50 kilograms. Her eyes are dark brown, and her hair is grey.

If you are curious about this question like others, this post is worth reading. MiniTool would introduce the two cards at first and then analyze the difference between microSD and microSDHC. Here are various brands and types of SD cards on the market so that you can get confused easily. Among multiple SD cards, microSD and microSDHC cards are highly discussed. What\u2019s the difference between microSD and microSDHC? Which one is better? This post introduces the two kinds of cards respectively and then illustrates the difference between them. You can make a decision after reading the content. MicroSD, a smaller variant of the SD card, is the first generation of Secure Digital cards. It was designed to boost your experience with the MMC (MultiMediaCard) standard. Besides, it can extend the storage space of mobile phones. This card usually is used in devices like cell phones, PDAs and smaller and lighter devices. The microSD card can be read by regular SD card slots via an adaptor. It uses FAT12, FAT16, or FAT16B file system.  As the microSD card is a kind of flash memory without moving parts, it is durable if maintained properly. The card is miniature about the size of a fingernail. Further reading: In addition to microSD cards, secure digital cards come in standard and mini formats. Standard-sized SD cards are frequently used in cameras, while miniSD cards are built for mobile phones. However, the miniSD cards have largely been replaced by microSD cards. You may also like this: TF Card vs Micro SD Card & How to Format It MicroSDHC stands for Secure Digital High Capacity. It is a sort of card with extended capacity that was introduced in 2009. It uses the FAT32 file system.  The capacity of the microSDHC card ranges from 2GB and up to 32GB. It works in hardware that supports either SDHC or SDXC. The \u201cSD\u201d in microSD and microSDHC represents \u201cSecure Digital\u201d referring to the type of technology utilized in the cards. Also read: SDHC VS. SDXC \u2013 Which One Is Better for You? This section shows you the difference between microSD and microSDHC on dimension, capacity, speed, use, as well as compatibility. Check the details by reading the content below. The dimension of microSD cards is 11mm by 15mm. Like microSD card, the microSDHC card also has the same standard size (11mm x 15mm). So, you don\u2019t have to consider the difference of dimension while you hesitate to buy a microSD or microSDHC card. Also read: Thumb Drive VS Flash Drive: Compare Them and Make a Choice The capacity is the primary difference between microSD and microSDHC. The maximum storage size of a microSD card is 2GB, while that of a microSDHC card is 32GB. The common-to-see capacities of a microSDHC are 16GB and 32GB. The maximum read and write speed of the microSD card is 25MB/s. Considering its small size, this speed is pretty fast. Compared with the microSD card, the microSDHC card has a higher transfer rate ranging from 50MB/s to 150MB/s. The speed of these memory cards depends on the speed classes they apply (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). The respective minimum serial data writing speed of them are 2MB/s, 4MB/s, 6MB/s, 8MB/s, and 10MB/s. The microSDHC and microSDXC cards\u2019 speed are marked by UHS 3 or UHS 1. The minimum speed of UHS 1 is 10MB/s, while that of UHS 3 is 30MB/s. You can also test the speed of the SD memory card manually. For that, the Disk Benchmark feature of MiniTool Partition Wizard helps. Download this program by clicking the button below and then follow the on-screen instruction to finish the installation. \nFree Download Then connect the microSD or microSDHC card to a Windows computer and run MiniTool Partition Wizard. Click Disk Benchmark in the main interface of the program and follow the prompted guide to complete the process. For more details, please refer to the article: Quick SD Card Speed Test on Windows PC/Android/Mac The microSD card is usually used for mobile phones for storing photos, videos, and applications. The microSDHC can be used on devices including telephones, tablets, action cameras, 360-degree cameras, and drones. The micro SDHC host devices are asked to accept older SD cards, which indicates that the older SD cards with new technologies can comply with an SDHC device. When buying a memory card, you should also take compatibility into consideration. If the card is not compatible with your device, it doesn\u2019t make sense. MicroSD cards can work with new host devices. It means that they are compatible with SD, SDHC, and SDXC host devices. As for micro SDHC cards, they are incompatible with SD host products. But they are compatible with SDXV and SDHC devices. MicroSD versus microSDHC: which one to buy? After reading the above comparison, you may have an answer in your mind now! There\u2019s no absolute answer. Instead, it depends on your need and preference. \nFive main differences between microSD and microSDHC cards have been explained. You can check the details by reading this post. Click to Tweet How to do with a new microSD or microSDHC card? This part will explain the details. Please keep reading. When you get a new microSD or microSDHC card, you often need to create a partition on it before putting it into use. Sometimes, you are even required to format the card. Generally speaking, the memory card is formatted before you get it. If you are still prompted with the message \u201cthe SD card needs to be formatted\u201d or something like that, you need to format the card by yourself. Besides, you are also strongly recommended to format the SD card periodically. This operation can boost the performance of it. What does format an SD card mean? To get more details, read the linked post. You have multiple ways to format an SD card. For instance, you can format a microSD or microSDHC card by using Windows built-in utilities like Disk Management, Windows Explorer, and Diskpart.

Close Bokeh is a word that carries a lot of weight in modern photography circles and can, surprisingly, breed heated conversations, but what does it really mean and how does it apply to portrait photography? As an introduction, consider the word\u2014which is derived from the Japanese term for \u201cblur\u201d or \u201chaze\u201d\u2014to mean the aesthetic quality of the out-of-focus parts of an image surrounding an in-focus subject. It is not simply something not in focus,\u00a0it is a product of shallow depth of field and can be quite beautiful on its own, but also lends to the beauty and effectiveness of the overall composition. Bokeh is most often noticed when points of light, either direct or reflected, are blurred and create a dappling effect in the background of an image, but bokeh is more than just soft spots of light, and the quality of bokeh is a product not only of light and photography technique, but of the type and quality of the lens one uses. Before we can discuss bokeh, it\u2019s important to understand the idea of depth of focus or, as it\u2019s more commonly referred to, depth of field. When we focus on a subject within our frame we can control how much of the overall image\u2014foreground to background\u2014is in focus. In a wide depth-of-field image, everything is in focus, from the items in the foreground to the primary person or subject of the photo, to the background. Think, for example, of a well-lit image of a person in front of distant mountains, in which the person and the mountains remain in focus. Shallow depth-of-field focusing is when one aspect of the image is in focus and the rest is slightly blurred. In portraiture, the aspect in focus is usually the face of the subject or even just the eyes, while the rest of the frame is in progressively softer focus.  \n\n\nWide Depth of Field\nShallow Depth of Field\n\n\n As an introduction to general portraiture, there are two ways to render shallow depth of field. First, adjust the aperture on your lens to a wider setting, ideally as open as possible. Lens apertures are measured in \u201cf-stops,\u201d with a wider opening having a lower f-number, such as f/1.8 or f/2. Conversely, smaller apertures are noted as f/22 or even higher. Every lens has a different set of f-numbers, and \u201cfast lenses\u201d are those better suited to create shallow depth of field. Setting a portrait lens, which generally has a focal length between 70mm to 135mm, to a wide-open aperture is a pretty straightforward way to render shallow depth of field with nearby subjects and thus create bokeh in the out-of-focus areas. A second way to create bokeh is to use a longer focal length lens, such as a telephoto. A telephoto lens not only suits photographing distant objects, it also condenses the elements within a frame to appear closer to each other. With focus on the primary subject in the foreground, items in the background will seem much closer to the subject but remain out of focus, creating a natural background blur. Again, think of a person in front of a mountain. If you are using a telephoto lens, you will need to distance yourself from your subject to achieve focus and to fit them comfortably in the frame, but the mountains will appear as if just behind the subject\u2019s head, nicely out of focus. The quality of this out-of-focus area is bokeh. Experts can then argue if it is \u201cpleasing,\u201d \u201csmooth,\u201d \u201ccreamy,\u201d or simply \u201cgood\u201d bokeh. For a bit more information on depth of field, in general, take a look at Todd Vorenkamp\u2019s three-part series on the subject. Bokeh is an effective tool in portrait photography. With a blurred background or even blurred items in the foreground on the side of a frame, the viewer\u2019s attention will be directed to the in-focus aspects of the image, normally the face and eyes. Using extremely shallow depth of field, photographers can place focus on just the eyes (or even on one eye) while the other facial features, the hair, and anything else in the foreground or background will be progressively out of focus. This is a very common practice in portraiture, but what exactly is \u201cgood\u201d bokeh and how is it created?  The concept of bokeh is, again, debated fiercely in some photography circles. Good bokeh is often described in subjective terms, but pleasing bokeh is just that\u2014pleasing to the viewer. It adds an element of beauty and does not distract from the subject or overall composition. More specifically, the edges of its out-of-focus light are not harsh or overly sharp and, if circles of blurred light are created in the image, they are uniformly illuminated and, hopefully, as round as possible. How does \u201cgood\u201d bokeh come about in portraiture? In addition to the previous techniques mentioned to create shallow depth of field, the type of bokeh is determined by the lens used. The shape of the diaphragm inside the lens, as well as the lens\u2019s optical design and the glass itself, are all key determinants of bokeh quality. The aperture of a lens is the adjustable hole through which light passes and its size and even shape can be controlled. The aperture in most modern lenses is created by an iris diaphragm, which uses a number of small blades that contract and open to vary the size of the aperture. The shape of the aperture, also determined by these blades coming together, whether a true round opening or an opening with polygonal dimensions, determines the shape of bokeh. This form of bokeh, perhaps the easiest to recognize, is created when individual lights, spectral highlights, or strong points of reflected light, like reflections from individual leaves or even hair, are in the frame but out of focus. The shape of the aperture will translate to the shape of these out-of-focus highlights, with a round aperture producing round highlights, a hexagonal aperture producing hexagonal highlights, and so on. In general, when an aperture is wide open, the shape is closest to circular. When setting your aperture, consider this if you want noticeably circular bokeh. Lens makers, recognizing the benefits of a pleasing circular bokeh, have created lenses with a high number of individual diaphragm blades or blades with curved edges to make the aperture more closely approximate a circle when set to narrower apertures. But bokeh is not only about circular highlights; the concept informs all aspects of the out-of-focus spaces within a frame. Some lenses are noted for creating a swirly bokeh and others for uniform and smooth characteristics. When using backdrops in portraiture, the bokeh created by the lens might overlap with the mottled design of a quality backdrop to wonderful effect. Those who know gear can speak on various lenses, new and vintage, that are known for particularly pleasing bokeh. Telephoto mirror (catadioptric) lenses are known for their \u201cdonut\u201d-shaped bokeh because their internal mirror blocks the center of the aperture opening. Companies like DIYP create insertable aperture discs with cutouts of hearts, stars, or smiley faces that will create bokeh in those shapes. In addition to aperture shape, the optical design of a lens and its ability to correct aberration are factors determining the characteristics of a lens\u2019s bokeh. If spherical aberration is not corrected, bokeh that is brighter on its edges or, conversely, brighter near its center, are the outcomes. In general, quality bokeh is created by quality optics, but not only\u2014it is a very subjective realm. In the past twenty years, as bokeh has become a more integral part of discerning photography, overall advances in lens making have created more affordable wide-aperture portrait lenses and aberration correction is a common feature for modern lenses, so the technology is within financial reach. Also, advances in digital and computational photography enable bokeh to be artificially generated and added to an image. Conversely, older, more traditional lens designs are also known for the quality of bokeh they produce, like, say, a Petzval-inspired lens, which produces very distinct and swirly bokeh. So, as a portrait photographer, how do you use the tools and techniques at your disposal to create powerful portraits with pleasing bokeh? Understanding the relationship between aperture, focal length, and depth of field is fundamental. Use fast-aperture portrait lenses and use them at their maximum aperture. Also, if using a long telephoto lens, move as close to your subject as possible and increase the distance between subject and background. When shooting on location, be sure to know your background; know if it has artificial light sources that will appear in the frame and how and when it is illuminated by natural light. Placement of bokeh in your image should be controlled to accentuate your primary subject best. When in a studio, try a neutral backdrop and utilize backlight or hair lights to create reflections and points of light around your subject. These are rules of thumb, but the key to understanding any photo technique, especially one as idiosyncratic as bokeh, is to experiment. In the Comments\u00a0section, below, let us know your thoughts on bokeh and any tips you may have for creating pleasing out-of-focus highlights in your images. \nEnglish\n \nUS Dollar\n Speed up future orders, see order history, create wish lists, and more.\n\nCreate a B&H Account\n\n America's Best Customer Service List-Newsweek America's Best Online Shops-Newsweek Prices, specifications, and images are subject to change without notice.

It is a huge alliance that currently controls the Indian Government and 17 more state governments of India. NDA doesn't have any interference in Government and is completely dependent on the leaders selected by the NDA members. The current chairman of NDA is Amit Shah. The NDA was founded in 1998 to take participation in the general elections. The main reason behind NDA was to form an anti-Indian National Congress Group. It was led by BJP and buildup with many parties like Samta Party, AIADMK, Shiv Sena (who later left the alliance and joined the congress alliance). The first Chairman of NDA was Atal Bihari Bajpai, Lal Krishna Advani, and the former deputy Prime Minister was the chairman from 2004 to 2014 and Amit Shah, who is the chairman from 2014. NDA's leader Narendra Modi took oath as Prime Minister of India in 2014, and in 2019, he again won with 353 seats successfully possessed by NDA with 43% of vote share. Shiv Sena was the only Hindutava ideology supportive Party. In 1999 with the support of few regional parties, NDA won the elections, and Atal Bihari Bajpai became Prime Minister for the third time and served all five years. In 2004, NDA loosed the elections from United Progressive Alliance, which Congress-led and Dr Manmohan Singh were chosen as the Prime Minister and ruled for ten years. These are the current members of NDA with the states they belong to. Currently, many higher authorities such as the Prime Minister of India, Chief Minister of many States like Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and Odisha are from National Democratic Alliance. Still, BJP never gets Kerala, Telangana and West Bengal. Apart from this, many other parties belong to NDA that are in rule. Here is a list of States along with their Chief Ministers who have NDA Governments. All the decisions regarding election seats, ministers and issues brought up in Parliament are taken by leaders and individual parties; NDA never interferes in that. There can be many disagreements from other parties and can have different votes in the alliance. There is an NDA Converter for this situation. At early, George Fernandez was the NDA converter, but in 2008, due to bad health, he left the position, and Sharad Yadav took charge. Currently, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Mr Chandra Babu Naidu, is the NDA Converter. NDA gave a number of amazing Leaders to India; many Prime ministers, Presidents, Vice Presidents and many more are from NDA and here is a list of some of them.

A new update to the specification, version 5.0, doubles its peak data rate and positions M-PHY for the next generation of flash memory storage applications. A 14 December MIPI Alliance press release details how the forthcoming MIPI UniPro v2.0 and JEDEC Universal Flash Storage (UFS) releases informed development of M-PHY v5.0. The updated specification adds a fifth gear\u2014\"High Speed Gear 5\" (HS-G5) at 23.32 Gigabits per second (Gbps)\u2014enabling engineers to double the potential data rate per lane compared with the previous specification. M-PHY v5.0 also responds to a range of other ecosystem requirements for connecting flash memory storage. MIPI Alliance Chairman Joel Huloux in the press release said, \u201cThe significant data rate and flexibility updates delivered in MIPI M-PHY v5.0 are the product of real-world feedback from the large base of implementers in a broad ecosystem. Many of the enhancements in v5.0 come from our close relationship with the JEDEC UFS community, and such cross-industry collaboration is key to fueling and aligning innovation to better serve the global flash memory storage market.\u201d For example, just as JEDEC UFS users helped influence MIPI M-PHY v5.0 development, members of the MIPI M-PHY Working Group likewise created a specification-measurement scheme around reference-clock and jitter parameters that was delivered to JEDEC for inclusion in the UFS specification. \u201cWe wanted to offer this guidance since the UFS specification would be defining parameters that would have a direct effect on M-PHY\u2019s performance,\" said Kirill Dimitrov, chair of the M-PHY Working Group. \"This close collaboration ensures that the specifications are fully aligned and ready for implementation within the ecosystem.\" The MIPI press release also notes that M-PHY v5.0, which is backward compatible through v4.1 of the specification, makes several legacy features optional to further enhance its latency performance and power efficiency. These revisions additionally make implementation of the interface smoother and faster for connecting flash memory-based storage, cameras and RF subsystems, and for providing chip-to-chip inter-processor communications (IPC). An updated conformance test suite for v5.0 is scheduled to be completed in 2022, and the M-PHY Working Group is already at work on evaluating needs for the next version of the specification. For example, the requirements of the automotive industry will factor especially heavily in the specification\u2019s evolution, and the working group hopes to see more original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) from that segment join the development effort. \u201cWe're particularly interested in additional guidance from carmakers so we can better understand their requirements and how those might be different from other ecosystems and other use cases,\u201d Dimitrov said. MIPI M-PHY v5.0 is available to MIPI Alliance members and can be downloaded from the member portal on the MIPI Alliance website.

While we do find that piano black is a welcome addition to spruce up a car on the exterior, the interior is better off without it. Now those of you who like this kind of trim would probably click away from this article pronto. These plastics don\u2019t age gracefully, and they\u2019re not the most pleasant to touch either. We\u2019re not condemning this kind of trim, but simply giving a few reasons and resolutions as to why it won\u2019t work.\u00a0 To preface, we think that black, in general, is a lovely color to use when you want to create contrast. We don\u2019t hate the color, just the finish, and what can happen to it over time or after a nice sweaty-handed touch. So here are a few reasons why piano black is best for pianos and not cars.\u00a0 Imagine that, you're not even a day into the ownership of your vehicle and this material already looks dirty. It\u2019s like a phone screen that when you touch, your fingerprints get all over the darned thing leaving smudges and all kinds of streaks that can be seen; even at a glance.\u00a0 While we\u2019re not totally fine with it, we do think that it is somewhat acceptable for the material to be inlaid into a part of the interior where human hands may never touch it, such as the dashboard or even as small design elements in a door card. The problem arises when manufacturers put this kind of material on key touch-points of a car. Places that are definite no-goes for piano black are the shifter, steering wheel, window switches, door handles and any button or knob that even has a remote chance of coming into contact with human skin.\u00a0 This second entry is another nail in the coffin since it gets quite annoying knowing that you don\u2019t even have to touch your car in order for it to get dirty. While matte and carpeted surfaces hide these small dust particles, piano black lets it show and proudly puts it on display for you to gawk at and get bewildered.\u00a0 This is why we don\u2019t prefer it, because to those of us who love to keep our interiors clean, piano black will just incite anxieties and make us feel the need to buy a microfiber towel to safely vacate these dust or dirt particles, which leads us to our next bit.\u00a0 All those dust particles will make us want to wipe down the trim piece with a nice microfiber cloth to keep it clean. Doing this not only keeps your interior clean, but it also gives it scratches over time. Tiny dust particles may not be hard enough to scratch the plastic, but bits of silt, sand, or a small rock could potentially scratch your panel with ease. Also, consider if you wear any form of jewelry. When plastic comes into contact with anything metal, glass, or even diamond, don\u2019t expect your panel to come out of it unscathed \u2013 literally.\u00a0 This is due to the material being so soft. Plastic may be a durable material, but it isn't something that resists scratches all that easy. Not only will it scratch, however, it will also show those scratches quite nicely. If you have ever seen an old black car with the clear coat still intact, it is likely that there are those dreaded swirl marks on the paint of the car. This is a similar situation for the plastic, but it won\u2019t be easy to repair \u2013 if at all.\u00a0 We would much rather have a matte finish on the interior of our cars, especially on vital touch points. While interiors don\u2019t stay new forever, there are materials that look newer over time. Almost everything else beats this material in terms of how it looks after a certain period of time.\u00a0 Longevity is key when you are buying a car. A car would undoubtedly feel newer if the interior is resistant to any form of scratching. If manufacturers really want to add a bit of shine to the interior of a car, then a good hard coat on top of shiny plastics could possibly preserve an interior panel, either that or just don\u2019t put piano black plastics anywhere near the interior.\u00a0 The Honda BR-V is out and better than ever.

Sharma was commenting on the Gyanvapi mosque controversy. The mosque in northeast India was built on the site of an earlier Hindu shrine. Some Islamists have reportedly claimed that there actually was no shrine at the site. During the TV segment, Sharma rhetorically asked if she should \"mock\" some parts of the Muslim holy book, the Quran. She specifically mentioned \"flying horses,\" a likely reference to the buraq creature. She also brought up the Prophet Muhammad's marriage to Aisha, describing her as 9 years old at the time the marriage was consummated, according to local media.\u00a0 Aisha\u2019s exact age at the time of the marriage is unknown. Some scholars believe she was a child. Others have countered that she had reached puberty by time the marriage was consummated. Critics of Islam regularly cite Aisha\u2019s age.\u00a0 After Sharma\u2019s comments, the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s spokesman for the Delhi region Naveen Kumar Jindal accused Muhammad of rape in a tweet.\u00a0 Sharma later apologized, saying she was lashing out in response to insults to Hindus. For his part, Jindal subsequently deleted the tweet. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which is India\u2019s governing party and espouses Hindu nationalism, has also suspended both of them.\u00a0 Both incidents have caused outrage in India and led to communal violence.\u00a0 Reactions: The row has elicited strong reactions from Middle Eastern states. The United Arab Emirates\u2019 Foreign Ministry condemned \u201cstatements insulting the Prophet in India\u201d today. The Saudi Foreign Ministry denounced the remarks yesterday, while Qatar demanded an apology as Indian Vice President Venkaiah Naidu was in the Gulf state on a trade mission. Kuwait also summoned the Indian ambassador over the issue.\u00a0 One supermarket in Kuwait went so far as to pull Indian products from its shelves in response.\u00a0 Iran also summoned the Indian ambassador yesterday over the issue.\u00a0 The response from Middle Eastern governments has elicited equally strong reactions on South Asian social media. A hashtag calling for a boycott of Qatar Airways is trending on Twitter, and some BJP politicians are joining in.\u00a0 \u00a0 Economic boycott is the only solution. #BycottQatarAirways \u00a0 One Pakistani television station tweeted in support of the Gulf states and called on all Muslims to boycott India.\u00a0 \u00a0 Many thanks to Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and all Arab countries-The way you have spoken out against Indian extremism is commendable\nNow is the time for Muslims all over the world to boycott India-#\u0625\u0644\u0627_\u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644_\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647_\u064a\u0627_\u0645\u0648\u062f\u064a \u00a0 \u00a0 An Arabic-language hashtag praising Muhammad that is addressed to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also trending on the social media platform.\u00a0 Why it matters: India is an important economic partner for Gulf states, and the fallout could threaten this relationship. In April, India and the UAE signed a landmark agreement aimed at boosting trade between the two countries. India is already a major trade partner of the UAE, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states.\u00a0 Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian is also visiting India next week. The visit was scheduled before the controversy.\u00a0 Know more: India under Prime Minister Modi has been widely criticized for discriminating against its Muslim citizens. Gulf states have been largely silent on the issue.\u00a0 Business and policy professionals use PRO to monitor the regional economy and improve their reports, memos and presentations.

She is the estranged wife of Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India. The couple were married in 1968 when she was about 17 and Modi was 18. A short time into the marriage,they split\n. He did not acknowledge the marriage publicly until he was legally required to do so before the 2014 Indian general elections. Having retired from teaching, Jashodaben is said to lead a simple life of prayer.\n Jashodaben was born as Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi in 1951. Her mother died when she was two years old.\n Narendra Modi and Jashodaben had an arranged marriage in the custom of the caste of Vadnagar, starting with a family-arranged betrothal in their very early childhood. According to Narendra Modi's brother, the couple had undergone vivaaha, the religious ceremony of marriage when Narendra Modi was 18 and Jashodaben was about 17.\n A marriage ceremony was held to begin their married life together when she was 17 and he was 18. Modi abandoned Jashodaben soon after the marriage.\n After about two years of being out of contact with all who knew him, Modi returned to Vadnagar and contacted his family. He had made plans to go to Ahmedabad to work at his uncle's canteen. At his mother's insistence, Jashodaben came to the family household to maintain their marriage, but her husband objected to the arrangement, insisting on continuing his life on his own terms and encouraging her to continue in her studies.\n He told me once that \"I will be travelling across the country and will go as and where I please; what will you do following me?\" When I came to Vadnagar to live with his family, he told me \"why did you come to your in-laws' house when you are still so young, you must instead focus on pursuing your studies\". The decision to leave was my own and there was never any conflict between us. He never spoke to me about the RSS or about his political leanings. When he told me he would be moving around the country as he wished, I told him I would like to join him. However, on many occasions when I went to my in-laws' place, he would not be present and he stopped coming there. He used to spend a lot of time in RSS shakhas. So I too stopped going there after a point and I went back to my father's house. Jashodaben said that she spent a total of about three months with her husband during a three-year period before their final separation.\n Jashodaben continued with her professional life, receiving a Secondary School Certificate in 1972 or 1974, completing teacher's training in 1976 and becoming a teacher in 1978. From 1978 to 1990, she taught in Banaskantha district. In 1991 she moved to Rajosana village and remains there. She is retired and her pension is \u20b914,000 (US$180) per month. One commentator said that her low salary would have made much of life a hardship for her. Talking about her relationship with Modi, in one interview Jashodaben said \"We have never been in touch... There has been no communication from his end to this day.\" In a later interview Jashodaben said that until 1987, she and Modi spoke \"normally\". Jashodaben lives with her brother Ashok and his wife in Unjha.\n Rumours had long been circulating that Modi was actually married. In 1992, Jashodaben refused to be interviewed by the newspaper Abhiyan when that publication presented a story on the marriage of her and Modi. Darshan Desai, a reporter for The Indian Express, located Jashodaben in May 2002, but she and others in her village had refused to speak to him and he was told to leave the town. In 2009, it was reported that Modi's political enemies had discovered her teaching at a school and living in a one-room tenement. Modi himself did not quite deny that she was his wife, although he did not explicitly acknowledge it either. Her marriage to Modi was said to be common knowledge in her village. She was reportedly diligent and well liked as a teacher, especially among her students. When found by a reporter, she became worried and nervous, saying only \"I will not say anything against my husband. He is very powerful. This job is all I have to survive. I am afraid of the consequences.\"\n When required to fill out forms on which his spouse was requested to be identified, Modi had repeatedly been leaving the spousal information section blank or just marked with a dash\u00a0\u2013 including in state assembly elections in 2001, 2002, 2007 and 2012. At political rallies he had said he was single.\n In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi contested the Vadodara seat in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India. Under the Representation of the People Act and following recent rulings stating that a complete response was mandatory, Modi was required to declare any previous marriage. Following legal advice to \"come clean\" about the issue, for the first time in public and media, Modi acknowledged that he had a wife.\n Sombhai Modi, Narendra Modi's brother, issued a statement saying that the arranged marriage had been forced on Modi by his family. He said that the marriage was never consummated, and that Modi left it soon after it was solemnized, thus confirming that the marriage actually never took place. His brother further said that Modi had been inspired by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda to work for the nation and society.\n Before Modi officially acknowledged his marriage, a group of activists and security professionals visited Jashodaben at her home. They offered to escort her on the Char Dham pilgrimage, which was a trip which she had long wanted to take. During the trip, they took her to the ashram of Swami Ramdev in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand. Journalists sought Jashodaben for comment at the news of the marriage, but her family told them that she would return home soon.\n To contest the election, Modi's political opponents criticised his evasions of facts about his marriage on official documents. Nishant Varma, a citizen of Ahmedabad, sought criminal charges against Modi for having failed to acknowledge his legal wife and forge previous election documents as against prescribed rules of the Representation of the People Act. The case is subjected to revision in the Supreme Court of India. The lower court pronounced Modi as not guilty of any criminal offense under this Act.\n In summer 2014, Congress party politician Ajay Rai filed a lawsuit to be heard by the Allahabad High Court complaining, among other things, that Modi did not give the permanent account number of Jashodaben.\n In February 2014, a reporter for The Indian Express interviewed her.\n It was reported in April 2014 that she does not speak ill of her husband, and does not tolerate when others do so.\n In May 2014, TV9 Gujarat interviewed her on video.\n In June 2014, at what has been described as \"her first public event\", Jashodaben attended the public funeral of politician Gopinath Munde.\n Jashodaben said that she was not invited to the swearing-in ceremony of Narendra Modi, but had she been invited, she would have gone. \"I wish to be with him. If he calls me, I am eager to start a new life with him. But it has to be he who calls,\" she said in 2014.\n In November 2014, she made her first trip to Mumbai, where she prayed for her husband at the Mahalakshmi Temple and the Siddhivinayak Temple.\n In December 2014, a writer for Pakistani news agency Dawn News said that not many newspapers have had the courage to report the troubles which Jashodaben has experienced.\n In February 2015, Jashodaben hosted some Christian missionaries who invited her to join their mission to help many destitute and helpless Hindus by teaching Gita and Ramayana to them.[failed verification] In June 2015, Jashodaben was scheduled to speak at a conference on politics organized by supporters of Modi. Event organizers reported that the conference was shut down on the second day of the week-long program on the direction of the BJP leader Amit Shah and others. No reason was given for cancelling the conference, but people in attendance claimed Jashodaben's presence as the cause.\n In November 2015, Jashodaben applied for a passport in order to visit relatives and friends overseas. As she was unable to produce a marriage certificate or a joint affidavit from her husband, the application was rejected by the regional passport office as \"incomplete\". Her brother Ashok stated that a legal option was being considered.\n \nThe separation of Jashodaben and Modi has been discussed in the context of a broader trend in India that politicians may have more success if they are known for not having ties to a spouse. The RSS, which gives Modi political support, values celibacy in its senior leadership but contrarian tones have been noted.\n Many Congress party politicians have criticised Modi's treatment of the estrangement of his wife.\n I am surrounded by five security guards all the time. Often my relatives or I have to cook for them, my sister-in-law has to make their beds. This is a bit annoying... You see, it gets really chaotic when I have to travel, because I use public transport and the guards are following me in an air-conditioned car.\n Jashodaben, to Reuters, November 2014\n From May 2014, police from the Mehsana district began providing continual police protection for Jashodaben. The security agent team following her was assigned as a response to the Special Protection Group Act, which says that the spouse of the Prime Minister of India should receive police protection. The Salaries and Allowances of Ministers' Act describes other benefits which are typically given to spouses of prime ministers.\n In November 2014, Jashodaben filed a Right to Information Act (RTI) request seeking details about her security and rights as the spouse of the prime minister. Various media organizations in India reported the RTI in different ways, including emphasizing Jashodaben's fear, the financial implications of her complaint, the guards' demands to be treated as guests, or the case as an example of female independence. Jashodaben has said that her security guards have refused to show any identification or to say on whose orders they have been assigned to her, and have suggested she refrain from talking with the media. The Gulf News reported that her security guards are primarily with her to conduct surveillance on her. Jashodaben's family has complained that her guards do not carry any identity cards, refuse to identify themselves, and refuse to name the person or office supervising them.\n In December, the Intelligence Bureau denied her request for information about orders, saying that the law has an exemption which applies in this case. Jashodaben uses the name \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\", which is her married name. The letter was addressed to \"Jashodaben, daughter of Chimanlal Modi\" (her father's name). At the end of December 2014, Jashodaben filed an appeal to the refusal. In addition to the appeal, Jashodaben complained that the government officers changed her name from \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\" to her maiden name \"Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi\". Doordarshan, India's public television broadcaster, presented Jashodaben on television 1 January 2015 to hear her comments on the issue. As a result of this broadcast, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting chastised staff at Doordashan and transferred the director of the broadcast from Ahmedabad to Port Blair 2,500\u00a0km away. On 6 February Jashodaben's request was again denied, and again addressed to \"Jashodaben, Chimanlal Modi's daughter\".\n In May 2015, Jashodaben filed a third request for the information about the security detail and their orders. She also complained that she had completed the forms using her legal name, \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\", but the government office replied to her using her maiden name. In response to the filing, a government representative said, \"If they are still not satisfied by the information given by the first appellate authority, they can file the second appeal at the Gujarat Information Commission.\" In response to the RTI request, commentator on women's issues Shobhaa De called Jashodaben a \"superhero\" and \"plucky\", and said that her actions were \"bold, blunt, and to the point\".\n This page was last updated at 2022-10-12 01:48 UTC.

However, the practical EMI shielding application of ultralight GAs is still a great challenge owning to their structural instability when exposure to complex environmental conditions. Here we report an ultra-stable GA with superior and reliable EMI shielding ability. The ultralight GAs (\u03c1=3.7 mg/cm3) with face-to-face stacked structures possess excellent electrical conductivity and high shielding effectiveness (SE) of 64.1 dB at the thickness of 1 mm. The absolute EMI SE reaches up to 171000 dB\u00b7cm2/g, far beyond the previous ultralight carbon-based materials. The excellent structural robustness of GAs ensured the stable operation in mechanical deformation, extreme temperature, flame and underwater environment. Meanwhile, the intrinsic conflict of ultralow density and oversized volume was solved by vacuum encapsulation without structural damage. Our GAs paved the way to the practical EMI shielding application and greatly broadened the applied scenes, such as aerospace, warcraft and ocean fields. \n  Keywords: graphene aerogel, mechanical stability, electromagnetic shielding, vacuum encapsulation, environmental adaptiveness \nSuggested Citation:\nSuggested Citation\n \n38 Zheda RoadHangzhou, 310058China\n \n38 Zheda RoadHangzhou, 310058China\n \n38 Zheda RoadHangzhou, 310058China\n \n38 Zheda RoadHangzhou, 310058China\n \n38 Zheda RoadHangzhou, 310058China\n \n38 Zheda RoadHangzhou, 310058China\n \n38 Zheda RoadHangzhou, 310058China\n \n38 Zheda RoadHangzhou, 310058China\n Materials Science eJournal \r\n                                    Subscribe to this fee journal for more curated articles on this topic\r\n                                 We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content.

Using a technique called Direct Coating, developed by Covestro, components have been produced with a smooth, high-gloss surface, which demonstrates improved scratch resistance and the ability to recover from minor scratches. For this development project, the Hyundai Santa Fe exterior door trim was selected due to the simple geometry and severe performance requirements. This allowed for optimization of molding conditions and comparison of the performance to the current production part. The prototype part demonstrated improved surface quality compared to paint, and passed car wash, chemical, and weathering test specifications. In addition to addressing quality issues, this method offers cost savings by eliminating the traditional painting process, which is expensive due to long cycle time, multi-step processing, and emissions regulations. Furthermore, this technology can be adapted to other substrate materials, different coating colors, and varying surface finishes such as matte and textured patterns within the same mold.\n Subscribers can view annotate, and download all of SAE's content.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLearn More \u00bb\n \nAccess SAE MOBILUS \u00bb\n \nNew Liquid Surface Conditioner for Low-Temperature Phosphating System Aimed at CO2 Emission Reduction 2010-01-0732 View Details \nNumerical Simulation for the Hybrid Process of Sheet Metal Forming and Injection Molding Using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Method 2019-01-0713 View Details \nDevelopment of a Wear Resistant Aluminum Alloy for Automotive Components 1999-01-0350 View Details"], "https://rrmobiles.in/?product=vivo-v19-storage-256-gb-8-gb-ram": [" \u20b935,990.00 \u20b927,990.00 Vivo Mystic Silver There are no reviews yet.

While iPhone 12 itself is no slouch when it comes to cameras, the iPhone 12 Pro Max takes the camera capabilities to another level thanks to a larger primary camera sensor that allows for better low-light performance. The sensor-shift stabilisation allows the handset to negate the shaking of hand while recording videos and as a result, iPhone 12 Pro Max produces some of the best videos you can record on a phone right now.                         \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Expert comment:\u00a0\u00a0\n                            Mi 11 Ultra is an anomaly.

"], "https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/technology-others/hd-vs-fullhd-coming-to-a-resolution-on-mobile-screens/": [" Apparently, the next lot of smartphones might just come with 2K screens\u2014these are displays with a resolution of 2560\u00d71440 pixels. A company named Vivo has already demoed such a phone, while rumours are flying around that Samsung\u2019s next flagship might have it too. To me, it\u2019s all a little ridiculous. Good Displays Aren\u2019t Only About Pixels Ever since Apple came out with a \u201cRetina Display\u201d and touted its \u201cppi\u201d (pixels per inch), everyone has been going nuts trying to cram more pixels into a screen. And generally, yes, the more pixels in a given space, the sharper the image will look. But pixels or resolution aren\u2019t the only things that go into making a good screen. I\u2019ve seen many phones that have qVGA (960\u00d7540) resolution look better than an HD (1280\u00d7720) screen. And the same goes for HD displays that look better than FullHD (1920\u00d71080) screens. A mobile phone\u2019s display depends on various factors apart from the pixels. There\u2019s the type of panel used\u2014you\u2019ve probably heard of jargon like AMOLED, LCD, IPS and more being thrown around. There\u2019s the image processor, like Sony\u2019s touted Mobile Bravia Engine. Even the type of scratch-resistant glass coating has an effect on the quality of the display. Several factors have to come together to make for a good-looking display and just amping up one\u2014like the resolution\u2014isn\u2019t going to help. So Why Are Pixels Talked About So Much There\u2019s a pretty simple explanation for why resolution becomes the most talked-about factor: it has cold numbers where bigger is better. It\u2019s really that simple. In cameras, the technology behind producing a good image is much more than what your megapixel count is, but we have reached a point where most people mistakenly believe \u201cmore megapixels = better camera.\u201d Similarly, in displays, the rest of the technology involved isn\u2019t easy to understand or explain\u2014even in the course of research for this article, I haven\u2019t got a grasp on all aspects yet. But a simple measure of numbers, where bigger is better, is something anyone can easily digest and hence this is the point which companies like to boast. The Real-World Test I have long maintained that for phones around 5 inches, it is difficult to tell an HD screen apart from a FullHD one unless you are going to be inspecting it very closely. Most people would hold the phone at the level of their elbow or perhaps a few inches closer. At that distance, I reckoned that an HD and a FullHD screen can\u2019t easily be told apart. With intense scrutiny, yes, but for regular usage, it doesn\u2019t make much of a difference. So I put my theory to test by laying out eight 5-inch phones and one 5.2-inch phone next to each other, some of which were HD and some of which were FullHD. They were all running the same game or ebook, and most people weren\u2019t able to tell the difference. I replicated this test one more time with the Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 and its 5.2-inch HD screen, pitting it against the Micromax Canvas Turbo\u2019s 5-inch FullHD screen. Without mentioning resolutions or sizes, I asked people which of the two phones had a better screen. Of the 13 people who saw both, 12 picked the Grand 2 as a better display. The reason was either because it\u2019s \u201cmore colourful\u201d or \u201clooks brighter.\u201d\nYup, the screen with the lower resolution was almost unanimously the one people liked more. What This Means For You The point, of course, is that resolution or pixel counts alone do not make a better screen. In some cases, there is a noticeable difference\u2014like when you compare a WVGA (800\u00d7480) screen with an HD one. But especially at HD resolution on 5-inch screens, it becomes difficult to tell those apart from a FullHD one. If you go up in size, perhaps FullHD would matter more, like with a 6-inch smartphone. So the next time you are shopping for a phone and if it\u2019s around 5 inches, as long as the resolution says \u201cHD\u201d or 1280\u00d7720 pixels, start to look at the other features. Spending any extra or buying inferior processors and RAM for the pleasure of a FullHD screen is not the smart decision.

Mincing no words, he spoke about the growing insecurity among Muslims and other minorities in the country in the wake of  majoritarian politics. In his interview with Rajya Sabha TV, Ansari said Muslims in the country were experiencing \u201ca feeling of unease. \u201cA sense of insecurity is creeping in,\u201d he noted. Speaking to his interviewer, Karan Thapar,the outgoinng Vice President  Ansari ascribed the spate of vigilante violence, mob lynchings, beef bans and \u201cghar wapsi\u201d campaigns to a \u201cbreakdown of Indian values\u201d and more significantly to the breakdown of the ability of the authorities to enforce the law. \u201cIndianness of any citizen being questioned is a disturbing thought.\u201d   Asked for his comments on recent court judgments like  singing of national anthem in cinema halls, obligatory chanting of \u2018Vande Matram\u2019 in educational institutions, government and private offices, Ansari observed: \u201cThe propensity to be able to assert your nationalism day in and day out is unnecessary. I am an Indian and that is it. The very fact of Indianness of any citizen being questioned is a disturbing thought.\u201d He is the person who spoke in public about the need to enforce justice after Mohammed Akhlaq was lynched in Dadri while the Prime Minister of our country took a full ten days to condemn the lynching. Now that the number of lynchings are mounting, the last public voice to talk about justice seems to have left the government.  \u00a9 Copyrights 2022. All rights reserved.

It projects itself as a champion of the socio-religious cultural values of the country's Hindu majority, conservative social policies, and strong national defense.  Its constituency is strengthened by the broad umbrella of Hindu nationalist organizations, informally known as the Sangh Parivar (League of Indian nationalist organizations), in which the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh plays a leading role. \n Since its inception, the BJP has been a prime opponent of the Indian National Congress.  It has allied with regional parties to roll back the left-of-centre tendencies formerly endorsed by the Congress Party, which dominated Indian politics for four decades.  The ideological rallying cry of the BJP is Hindutva, literally \"Hinduness,\" or cultural Hindu nationalism.\n The BJP, in alliance with several other parties, led the Government of India between 1998 and 2004, under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani, its most senior leaders.  It is the leading party within the National Democratic Alliance and leads the opposition.\n Part of a series onHindu politics\n Bharatiya Janata Party\nShiv Sena\n Hindu Mahasabha\nBharatiya Jana Sangh\nRam Rajya Parishad\n Integral humanism\nHindu nationalism\nHindutva\nUniform civil code\n Bal Gangadhar Tilak\nVinayak Damodar Savarkar\nMadhav Sadashiv Golwalkar\nSyama Prasad Mookerjee\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee\nLal Krishna Advani\nBal Thackeray\nPandit Madan Mohan Malaviya\n Vishal Agarwal\nB.C.

Lal\nHarsh Narain\nYvette Rosser\nArun Shourie\nRam Swarup\n The Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS, Indian People's Union) was founded in 1952 by Syama Prasad Mookerjee, a Bengali nationalist leader, former Union Minister and  freedom-fighter.  It was considered the political wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.  But the fortunes of the young party floundered in 1953, when Mookherjee died in Kashmir in jail during a protest. The BJS lasted for 24 more years, but never succeeded in winning control of any state or more than a small share of the seats of the Union Parliament.  It was unable to challenge the Indian National Congress, the leading organization in the nation's freedom movement, for a political majority, and always had to contend with lesser socialist parties for second and third places.  However, the party nourished future leaders who were seasoned with tough political experiences, like the future Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\n When Indira Gandhi imposed a state of emergency in 1975, postponing elections and misusing major central powers granted to her by the Constitution, the BJS joined a coalition of parties in active protest.  Several of its leaders were arrested, including Vajpayee.  But when Gandhi called elections in 1977, the BJS invested all its political and organizational capital in merging into the new Janata Party, a unified opposition party.  A mixture of socialists, regionalists, and former Congressmen, the party was united in opposition to the Emergency and Indira Gandhi.  The Janata Party defeated Indira Gandhi's Congress Party in a landslide victory and formed a government under Morarji Desai's leadership.  Vajpayee, the most senior BJS leader, became Minister for External Affairs.  His close friend and political comrade Lal Krishna Advani became the Minister for Information and Broadcasting.\n The Janata Party government lasted for barely two years, and following its collapse, Indira Gandhi's Congress returned in a thunderous landslide victory.  When the Janata Party imploded, the nucleus of the BJS reorganised themselves.\n The BJP was founded in December 1980, under the direct leadership of the duovirate of Vajpayee and Advani.  In the 1984 Lok Sabha elections, in which the Congress Party won a massive landslide victory following Indira Gandhi's assassination, the BJP obtained only 2 seats out of 543.  But in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 88 seats.  It supported the Janata Dal-led coalition of V.P. Singh.  On October 23, 1990, BJP leader L.K. Advani was arrested by the Chief Minister of Bihar, Laloo Prasad Yadav, due to his agitation for the construction of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple in Ayodhya.  The BJP withdrew its support of this government, and it collapsed the next month. \n In the 1991 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP became the premier opposition party, and the Congress government functioned as a minority.  During this time, the Janata Dal, the other major offshoot of the Janata Party, saw itself crumble into regional factions, and many leaders opted for the BJP. \n In 1996, the BJP became the single-largest political party in the  parliament, with the Congress at its lowest tally ever.  The President of India, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, appointed Vajpayee as Prime Minister and the BJP worked to foster a coalition that could command a majority in the Lok Sabha. [1] However the opponents of BJP were able to rally a majority and Vajpayee had to resign after only 13 days in power, allowing a broad centre-left coalition government to be formed instead, known as the United Front. \n Lok Sabha elections were again held in 1998, and the BJP again won the largest number of seats.  This time, the BJP formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) with allied political parties.  Besides its old allies, the Samata Party, the Shiromani Akali Dal and Shiv Sena, the BJP made friends in the Telugu Desam Party, the AIADMK, and the Biju Janata Dal.  The NDA had a slim majority, and Vajpayee returned as Prime Minister. [2] But the coalition ruptured in May 1999 when the leader of AIADMK, Jayalalitha, withdrew her support, and fresh elections were again called.  The BJP-led government lost its majority by only one vote when it was taken.\n The government provided significant support to the Prasar Bharati Act which gave government owned media channels more autonomy.  The Act had been passed by the National Front government with BJP support, but had been languishing relatively unimplemented ever since.\n The new Government carried out an electoral promise with the 5 nuclear tests at Pokhran, in Rajasthan in 1998, making India an unofficial nuclear power. [3]\n The Vajpayee administration also oversaw the country's defenses during the Kargil War, where the Indian military performed assaults and operations to recover strategic mountain posts from Pakistani soldiers who had occupied ground on the Indian side of the Line of Control.\n On October 13, 1999, the BJP-led NDA won as many as 303 seats.  The BJP won an all-time high of 183.  Vajpayee won his third term as Prime Minister, and Advani became the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister.  This NDA Government lasted for its full five years.\n The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance passed the Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act in 2002, a law increasing the powers of police authorities and intelligence agencies in an effort to curb subversive political activities and terrorism.  The POTA was promulgated chiefly in response to the December 13 2001 terrorist attacks on the Union Parliament. [4]\n Vajpayee and his economic team, led by Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha, pushed through major privatizations of big government corporations, the liberalization of trade under World Trade Organization rules, opening the skies to commercial airlines, foreign investment and ownership and developed \"Special Economic Zones\" where industries could enjoy special infrastructure.  The government especially catered to the rising information technology industry, and lowered taxes for middle-class Indians and businesses.  Record increases in agricultural and industrial production were matched by hungry middle-class consumers, and increasing foreign trade and investment.  In 2004, the Government signed the South Asia Free Trade Agreement with Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, a decision intended to vastly benefit over 1.6 billion people. \n Vajpayee took a personal interest in the Golden Quadrilateral project, a road system which aimed at linking the four corners of the nation with heavy, industrial roads.  His education programs boosted the enrollment of children into primary schools, expanded aid for schools and pushed new-age technologies to improve schooling.[1]\n Vajpayee was single-handedly responsible for three monumental efforts to build peaceful relations with Pakistan.  In 1999, he rode on the inaugural Delhi-Lahore bus, and signed the Lahore Declaration with the Pakistani Prime Minister, committing India to peace.  Despite the betrayal to come three months later in Kargil, Vajpayee in 2001 invited Pakistan's military ruler, Pervez Musharraf, to Delhi, though the summit failed with no result.  And despite the terrorist attacks that froze relations for two and a half years, Vajpayee, in a stunning and emotive speech to Parliament in August 2004, spoke of his \"absolute last attempt of my life\" to foster peace with Pakistan, de-freezing relations and invoking praise from world leaders.\n The 2000 Tehelka scam severely affected the credibility of the NDA Government and saw the Congress and its allies boycotting Parliament.  As a result, the then BJP President, Bangaru Laxman, and the Defense Minister, George Fernandes, were forced to resign.\n The BJP and the NDA suffered a shock defeat in the general elections in 2004, and failed to muster a parliamentary majority.  A.B. Vajpayee passed on the prime ministership to Dr. Manmohan Singh of the Congress Party, and its United Progressive Alliance.\n After the defeat was clear, several prominent BJP members including Sushma Swaraj and L.K. Advani, protested that Sonia Gandhi should not be permitted to hold the Prime Minister's office because of her Italian birth and other factors such as her lack of fluency in any Indian language, and her failure to take Indian citizenship for almost 15 years after her wedding to Rajiv Gandhi in spite of her claims to have \"become an Indian in her heart the day she became Indira Gandhi's daughter-in-law\". [5]\n The defeat was incomprehensible to most pollsters and political analysts, who assumed that the BJP would win on the basis of Vajpayee's widespread popularity, the national economic boom and the revival of the peace process with Pakistan.  Following the defeat, there was a perception amongst parts of the party cadre that the party had expected victory to come easy and thus volunteers of the organisation had not worked hard enough to canvass voters and recruit supporters, and that the political campaign of BJP had remained confined to television, radio and SMS (mobile phones).  There was also a belief that socio-religious organizations close to the BJP (the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Vishwa Hindu Parishad), offered little assistance in these elections, due to the BJP government's non-pursuit of the Ayodhya temple issue, uniform civil code, and other ideological staples, and the attitude of many BJP leaders that the BJP did not require their aid to be successful.  Independent analysts saw the defeat arising from a backlash by large classes of people who had not benefitted from the economic growth as well as a failure by the party to secure strong allies.  The BJP slogan of \"India Shining\" and the \"Feel Good Factor\" boomeranged. The most plausible theory is that India's elections are still on the basis of local factors. The BJP did incredibly well in states where it had recently won or where there was anti-incumbency (I.E. Madhya Pradesh, Punjab), but was badly beaten in states where it tied up with unpopular ruling parties (I.E. the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu and TDP in Andhra Pradesh). Caste combinations were another factor in its loss.\n BJP election poster 2004 in Bengali. Key Events:\nAugust 2004: Following the BJP's loss at the Centre, most of its government in Arunachal Pradesh joins the Congress en masse. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Uma Bharati resigns as she is charged in a dated case related to hoisting the Indian tricolour in a minority area.\nOctober 2004: The BJP and its alliance partner, Shiv Sena, fail in their bid to take back power in Maharashtra. In the wake of the defeat, party President Venkaiah Naidu quits, paving the way for Lal Krishna Advani to take up the post. \nFebruary 2005: Manohar Parrikar-led BJP government in Goa loses majority due to defections, forcing President's Rule. In state elections, the BJP-JD(U) combine emerges as the largest bloc in Bihar, but short of a majority, leading to months of political brinksmanship. In Jharkhand, the BJP is the largest party.\nMarch 2005: Congress is berated by media for using manipulative tactics to install a friendly government in Jharkhand. Following that government's quick collapse, Chief Minister Arjun Munda is able to regain his post. \nJune 2005: Advani's presidency was questioned by some after he made comments praising founding-father of Pakistan, Mohammed Ali Jinnah as a \"secular\" leader.  On a visit to Pakistan to transform his image from a hardliner to a peacenik in the Vajpayee mold, Advani invited a storm of criticism from the Hindu nationalist base of the party, and for several weeks lost control amidst fiery calls for his resignation.  His resignation was given and retracted, and a public clarification of his comments announced. [6] \nNovember 2005: An alliance of the Janata Dal-United and BJP wins a plurality in the Indian state of Bihar, allowing its first administration in that state. Uma Bharati, a former Chief Minister, leaves the party for the second time, announcing her own political outfit. This follows a decision by central BJP leaders to make Shivraj Singh Chauhan the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh \nJanuary 2006: As expected, Lal Krishna Advani finally resigns and a consensus candidate, Rajnath Singh, is handed the party's presidency. The BJP forms a coalition government with the Janata Dal-Secular in Karnataka, forming its first administration in South India.  \nMarch 2006: Madan Lal Khurana, a former Chief Minister and Governor, is expelled for anti-party remarks.  \nMay 2006: Pramod Mahajan, a former Union Minister and key strategist of the party, is killed by his brother in a major tragedy for the party. Babulal Marandi, a former Union Minister and Chief Minister, resigns from the BJP and floats his own political outfit.  \nJune 2006: Assembly Elections are held in West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam and Pondicherry. BJP can only win a dozen-odd seats in Assam and draws a blank in the others.  \nSeptember 2006: Independents backing the BJP-led government in Jharkhand force its collapse. \nNovember 2006: Rajnath Singh is formally elected as President, unopposed.  \nDecember 2006: Navjot Singh Sidhu, BJP MP from Amritsar, resigns after he is convicted of manslaughter. The charges related to an incident in 1988 when he dragged an elderly man out of his car and showered him with blows after a road accident.\nFebruary 2007: BJP and its ally, Shiv Sena, retain control over the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation, the nation's richest civic body. In Assembly elections, the BJP regains power in Uttarakhand and Punjab, in alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal.\n The BJP is a religious conservative political organisation.  It sees itself as rising to the defence of indigenous culture, and Indian religious systems which include Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism and Buddhism.  To many Hindu nationalists, Bharat is a Hindu Rashtra, literally a Hindu nation.\n According to BJP, this definition does not exclude Muslims, Christians.  Hindu Rashtra is portrayed as cultural nationalism and Hinduism as the entire complex system of culture, history, faith and worship that have evolved in India over the past 5,000 years.  In the political language of Hindu nationalists, all the peoples of India, their cultures and heritage are \"Hindu,\" which literally means \"inhabitant of the land of the river Sindhu,\" the modern-day Indus.\n While the draft manifestation of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (The organization that spawned the BJP) mentions the \"Hindu Rashtra\", the BJP has historically raised objections to this view.  The party's chief objective is the \"building up of India as a modern, progressive and enlightened nation\" which draws inspiration from India's ancient Hindu culture and values.  The key theorist of the party, K. Upadhyaya, authored the publication titled Integral humanism which laid down the foundations for this view.  According to Upadhyaya, the so-called \"monarch\" and \"state\" are the dharma and the chiti (genius) of society.  He asserted that the very source of meaning in Indian society is the concept of \"national identity\". The BJP stresses the importance of integrating the four ends of human life in accordance with Hindu scripture i.e., kama (gratification),artha (wealth), dharma (faith), and moksha (spiritual release).[2]\n The BJP has been accused of being a xenophobic and fascist organization by its opponents.  Its supporters, on the other hand, argue that it is no more than a conservative, nationally oriented party which does not wish to polarise the country on communal (religious) grounds.  These accusations are largely regarded as a smear campaign against the BJP by left-wing pundits.  In addition, accusations of \"fascism\" in BJP the Hindutva movement coming from the left wing parties and western academics such as Christoffe Jaffrelot have been criticized by former professor of political philosophy[3] and Times of India commentator Jyotirmaya Sharma as a \"simplistic transference [that] has done great injustice to our knowledge of Hindu nationalist politics\".[4]\n The life and work of the BJP is seen by many as strongly influenced by the Partition of India in 1947.  The partition was traumatic legacy for most religious communities in India.  Millions migrated to find safety in one of the two new states.  During the chaos surrounding partition over half a million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims, were killed in communal riots wake of horrendous carnage.  The trauma of midnight evacuations of ancestral homes, and being forced to wade through murderous violence, chaos and confusion to despair and helplessness in a different land which became their home, has struck deep in the veins of Hindu nationalists.\n Another important factor in the ideological construction of the ideology of BJP is the ongoing territorial dispute over Jammu and Kashmir and the wars of 1947-48, 1962, 1965, and 1971 and recently the 1999 Kargil War.  The BJP and its supporters feel India must remain vigilant against threats from Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, and elsewhere such as Bangladesh even Sri Lanka.\n The BJP has often been accused of participation in religious violence and using religiously sensitive issues for political advantage.  These accusations, largely a political smear campaign by opposition parties, have tarnished the image of BJP in the eyes of many Indians, particularly Muslims.  Many left wing journalists and observers feel that the BJP is a fascist organization with a clear anti-Muslim bias.  This is in spite of the fact that the party has promoted a number of Muslims like Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the late Sikandar Bakht and Dr. Najma Heptulla into prominent leadership position, and even had a prominent member of the Indian Jewish community, J.F.R. Jacob, among their ranks.\n BJP has certain demands and actions that are explicitly controversial, and give rise to charges of fomenting communal tensions.  The Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya is probably the most important of such issues.  Claims are made that Muslim invaders destroyed an ancient temple in the city of Ayodhya in medieval times, building Babri Mosque on its site. \n The Vishwa Hindu Parishad in the 1970s, inaugurated an organized campaign to re-build the Hindu temple there, because the site is considered the birthplace of the Ramayana's hero, Lord Rama, one of the most popular incarnations of Lord Vishnu. \n For two decades, the protests were peaceful.  But in the late 1980s, the issue turned more controversial than ever.  The VHP began to demand a direct demolition of the mosque, and the BJP embraced the issue as its own. \n The Ram temple having become a major demand of the BJP, its activists joined the ranks of protestors, and many major party rallies were held in Ayodhya.  The emotional power of this issue was a primary factor in the BJP winning the 1991 state assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of India, and shot the party to national prominence. \n However, on December 6 1992, emotional manipulation turned to violence as a parade of protestors burst upon the mosque and tore it down with pickaxes and shovels.  The resulting country-wide outburst of anger, murder, looting and burning resulted in over 1,000 deaths.  In the aftermath of the communal violence many sectors felt that the secular fabric of India was threatened.  The VHP was banned and Advani and other leaders of the BJP were arrested.  Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi are two BJP leaders on a CBI chargesheet for the destruction.  Despite the arrests, the political power of BJP continued to grow rapidly.\n The BJP is one of the few parties in India to have a popular-based governing structure, where workers and leaders at the local level have a great say in much of the decision-making.  This has also been blamed for public spats between different factions of the party.\n The topmost leader in the party is supposed to be the party President.  Officially, the BJP constitution provides for a three-year term for the President.  Recently, both Venkiah Naidu and LK Advani resigned ahead of schedule due to circumstances.  Rajnath Singh has held this post since January 2006.  Elections will be held on November 26, 2006, in which it is widely perceived Mr. Singh will have no opposition to officiate his term.  Beyond this, there are several Vice-Presidents, General-Secretaries, Treasurers and Secretaries.  The National Executive consists of an undetermined number of senior party leaders from across the nation who are the highest decision-making body in the party.  At the state level, a similar structure is in place, with every state unit being led by the respective President, who also officially serves a three-year term. \n The rank-and-file leadership of BJP largely derives from the cadre of the Rashtriya Sayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which has millions of affiliates.  It also maintains close links to other Sangh Parivar organisations, such as Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Swadeshi Jagran Manch (an organisation promoting consumption of domestic goods over foreign imports).\n Mass organisations associated with the BJP include:\n Outside of India, BJP followers have formed the 'Overseas Friends of BJP'.\n As per the party's constitution the objectives of the party is explained as \"the party is pledged to build up India as a strong and prosperous nation, which is modern, progressive and enlightened in outlook and which proudly draws inspiration from India's ancient culture and values and thus is able to emerge as a great world power playing an effective role in the comity of Nations for the establishment of world peace and a just international order.\n The Party aims at establishing a democratic state which guarantees to all citizens irrespective of caste, creed or sex, political, social and economic justice, equality of opportunity and liberty of faith and expression.\n The Party shall bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established and to the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy and would uphold the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India.\"\n The core agenda of BJP is inspired chiefly by Hindu nationalism.  Though not in order of importance, the chief goals of BJP may be summarized as follows: \n (1)The Repeal of Article 370 of the Constitution, which grants a special status to Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir and prevents non-Kashmiris from owning property in the state, in an effort to protect its Muslim-majority.\n (2)The Promulgation of a Uniform Common Civil Code, which create only one personal and civil law code for Hindus, Muslims and Christians, who enjoy the privilege of having law codes tailored to their religious culture over personal and family matters. In the minds of BJP supporters, this system creates a sense of division in the country between religious communities. \n (3)A Ban on Cow Slaughter, to honor the Hindu tradition of deeming cows and most cattle as sacred, and prohibiting the consumption of beef and pork. \n (4)The Ban on Religious Conversions.  The BJP argues that it has become virtually impossible to distinguish 'forcible' incidents of conversion from personal choice.\n (5)The Construction of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple in Ayodhya.\n (6)To achieve the full territorial and political integration of Jammu and Kashmir with India.  Presently over 40% of the territory is under the control of Pakistan and China. \n The BJP stands for strong national defense, small government and free-market economic policies, but Hindutva has been its core philosophy and identity ever since its inception. The BJP stand on economic policies saw a sudden volte face in the mid nineties from a support of swadeshi products to the embracing of free market ideas.\n lal krishna adwani\n The BJP has a number of prominent public figures among its members, who have either either campaigned for, contested elections for or held office for the party.  The induction of celebrities into the party helped the party receive extra attention from the media and the public, but it has also received criticism from others, who have claimed that the celebrities knew little about politics or would create an image of elitism for the party. \n BJP-Ruled States Without Outside Support\n Head of a Coalition Government\n Junior Partner in a Coalition With a <a data-rte-meta=\"%7B%22type%22%3A%22internal%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22National%20Democratic%20Alliance%20Partner%20%28NDA%29%22%2C%22link%22%3A%22National%20Democratic%20Alliance%20%28India%29%22%2C%22wasblank%22%3Afalse%2C%22noforce%22%3Atrue%2C%22wikitext%22%3A%22%5B%5BNational%20Democratic%20Alliance%20%28India%29%7CNational%20Democratic%20Alliance%20Partner%20%28NDA%29%5D%5D%22%7D\" data-rte-instance=\"278-76616945150cd01cf177da\" href=\"/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance_(India)\" title=\"National Democratic Alliance (India)\">National Democratic Alliance Partner (NDA)</a>\n Coalition With a <a data-rte-meta=\"%7B%22type%22%3A%22internal%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Non-NDA%22%2C%22link%22%3A%22National%20Democratic%20Alliance%20%28India%29%22%2C%22wasblank%22%3Afalse%2C%22noforce%22%3Atrue%2C%22wikitext%22%3A%22%5B%5BNational%20Democratic%20Alliance%20%28India%29%7CNon-NDA%5D%5D%22%7D\" data-rte-instance=\"278-76616945150cd01cf177da\" href=\"/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance_(India)\" title=\"National Democratic Alliance (India)\">Non-NDA</a> Party\n In January 2006, it also gained power in <a data-rte-meta=\"%7B%22type%22%3A%22internal%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Karnataka%22%2C%22link%22%3A%22Karnataka%22%2C%22wasblank%22%3Atrue%2C%22noforce%22%3Atrue%2C%22wikitext%22%3A%22%5B%5BKarnataka%5D%5D%22%7D\" data-rte-instance=\"278-76616945150cd01cf177da\" href=\"/wiki/Karnataka\" title=\"Karnataka\">Karnataka</a> state, when the ruling Janata Dal (Secular) governing majority fractured, with one faction aligning with the BJP to form a coalition government.

With the help of its affiliated organizations, it recruited members and support among conservative Hindus in this region.  It was also identified with the Upper Castes and traders/merchants.  The cause of Hindutva in the 1990s helped it to expand its appeal to other Castes.  Its time in power in the Centre and recruitment of more leaders from other backgrounds helped it to establish a foothold in areas it was not traditionally accepted.  Beyond the upper castes, it has also recruited a number of leaders, and subsequently, voters, from the Other Backward Castes (OBC's) and Scheduled Tribes/Scheduled Castes (SC/ST's).  The party also saw a powerful surge its support among urban India's middle and upper classes.  The BJP's desire to reach out to new constituencies and retain its traditional voter base has been a source of major internal conflict within the party.\n Template:FootnotesSmall\n }}.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on his way to a second term in office after the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took an unassailable lead in the South Asian country\u2019s general elections, according to preliminary results. The Hindu nationalist party is leading in 294 seats out of 542 seats, with its main rival, the Indian National Congress (INC), ahead in 50 seats, according to the latest data from the\u00a0Election Commission of India. However, it was not clear what percentage of the estimated 600 million votes had been counted. Here is what you need to know about the BJP. The Hindu nationalist\u00a0BJP (Indian People\u2019s Party) was founded in 1980, but it actually emerged from its precursor \u2013 the Bharatiya Jan Sangh (BJS). The BJS was founded in 1951 by Syama Prasad Mukherjee, a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) \u2013 a Hindu supremacist organisation that wants India to be defined as a Hindu nation. Modi, like many leaders of his party, is a lifelong member of the RSS, which was formed in 1925, and is inspired by European\u00a0ethnonationalism and fascism. BJS leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee formed the Janata Party to oppose the emergency imposed in 1975 by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of the Congress. In 1977 general elections, the Janata Party swept the polls and its leader Morarji Desai became the prime minister. The Janata Party government, however, collapsed two years later due to political bickering. Vajpayee, along with\u00a0another BJS leader Lal Krishna Advani,\u00a0founded the BJP in 1980. The BJP advocates the ideology of Hindutva (or Hinduness), which insists that multireligious and multiethnic India is fundamentally a \u201cHindu Rashtra\u201d (Hindu Nation). Hindutva seeks to define Indian culture in terms of Hindu values. The party came to national prominence in the late 1980s after it led a nationwide movement to build a temple in place of a mosque in Ayodhya town built during the reign of Mughal emperor Babar. In 1992, the BJP and another right-wing organisation Vishva Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council)\u00a0rallied more than 100,000 Hindu mobs which tore down the 16th-century mosque. The demolition sparked nationwide religious riots that left about 2,000 people dead, and created a fissure in Hindu-Muslim relations that have not recovered. In this election, the BJP ran a divisive campaign, with its leaders accused of indulging in anti-Muslim rhetoric to polarise votes. In the 1996 general elections, the BJP emerged as the single largest party in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament), forming its first coalition government led by Vajpayee. But the coalition government lasted only\u00a0for 13 days as it could not prove the majority in the House. The BJP and its allies came back to power again after 1998 elections, with Vajpayee becoming prime minister for the second time. However, after 13 months in office, the Vajpayee government collapsed yet again after its main ally pulled out of the government. In 1999, the BJP formed the\u00a0National Democratic Alliance\u00a0(NDA), a coalition of over 20 parties, which went on to win the elections. Vajpayee came to power for the third time as part of the NDA coalition. But in 2004 elections, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) led by the Congress party came to power. The UPA returned to power in 2009 elections on the back of impressive economic growth. Modi led the BJP to a landslide victory in 2014 on an anti-corruption plank. Before taking over as the prime minister, he was the chief minister of Gujarat state for 13 years. The right-wing party won 282 seats gaining absolute majority \u2013 the first party to do so in three decades. In the past five years,\u00a0India recorded a \u201cdisturbing\u201d number of hate crimes, including assault, rape and lynchings. Earlier this year, Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, warned against \u201cdivisive politics\u201d. \u201cWe are receiving reports that indicate increasing harassment and targeting of minorities \u2013 in particular, Muslims and people from historically disadvantaged and marginalised groups, such as Dalits and Adivasis,\u201d Bachelet said in her annual report to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in March.

The history of the piano is very long and involves many different people. The contemporary key and keyboard system we use was invented primarily by a man by the name of Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700. He was an Italian harpsichord mechanic and musical instrument technician who invented a new keyboard instrument complete with a hammer and damper system, very much like today\u2019s pianos.\u00a0 At the time, he was employed by the Florentine court of Grand Prince Ferdinando de\u2019 Medici. Their instrument registry lists an instrument called arpicimbalo or \u201can instrument resembling a harpsichord.\u201d The instrument was described about a decade later by poet Scipione Maffei as gravicembalo col piano, e forte (harpsichord with quiet and loud), which is the first usage of the original name, fortepiano or loud-soft. Cristofori\u2019s fortepiano developed over the next century and by the mid-1800s had expanded to a 7 octave keyboard, big enough for the expressive range of emotions found in the music of Frederic Chopin and Franz Liszt. By 1880, piano manufacturer Steinway debuted the 88-key piano and their model has been the standard ever since. The 88 key piano includes 7 octaves plus an additional 3 keys below the bottom C. The contemporary piano has 52 white keys and 36 black keys with one octave equal to 7 white keys and 5 black keys.\u00a0 Have you ever wondered how many white keys on a piano? How many black keys on a piano? Almost every type of acoustic piano has exactly the same amount of keys, which is commonly 88. This number might seem odd, but we have to remember that inside of each octave of the piano we have 12 individual notes, and that those individual notes repeat themselves every time that we land on the same letter, repeated an octave above.\u00a0 The lowest note on a classical acoustic piano is a low A. Then we continue up 7 octaves, getting us to 84 keys, then we add a final A, Bb, B and C note and that lands us at the final number of 88. It is common for other instruments that use a keyboard, like an organ, to have much fewer notes or even two different piano beds one on top of another. Notice that they both have fewer notes than a traditional keyboard, but that is not a problem, that is intended! Many different types of keyboards work for many different styles of music.\u00a0 Contemporary composers generally stick to the standard 88-key range of the piano, but there are some exceptions. The world record keyboard is 9 octaves with 108 keys made by Stuart and Sons in 2018. Bosendorfer builds a 97-key piano with 9 extra keys at the bottom of the instrument. These extra notes on a piano keyboard add deep harmonic resonance to the already rich sound of the instrument. The white keys on piano are commonly the first thing that a new pianist will learn. This is not because they are more simple, but because the letters of our music system fall on the white keys, in alphabetical order. We can use the keys to find our way around playing any piece of music, or making any impressive chord. The white keys also entirely show the C major scale. The keys on the piano are very often called the simple way to play the piano, but many seasoned pianists will actually tell you playing in key signatures with only white keys can often be more difficult on your hands than playing in a key that has both white and black keys, because they fit better in your hand.\u00a0 The black keys on the piano are generally thought of as being trickier than the white keys on a piano, simply because they are raised up physically on the keyboard. This is a common misconception: black keys are the best thing about learning to play, because they let you understand where your hand sits on the instrument, and they also allow you to physically feel your way around the keyboard in such a way that you do not have to use your eyes to look at your hands. Eventually you will learn to trust your hands and feel your way around. This is how many famous blind pianists were able to perform at such a high level, the instrument is very easy to feel and let your hands be your eyes, while you look at music.\u00a0 The difficult thing about learning your black keys is learning that they can have two different names, depending on which one of our keys we have modified. Take for instance the key Bb. Flat means that the note is one half step lower than previously. That black key can always be found, because it is the last key in the group of three black keys, simple. However, that note can also be called A#. You can rely on the fact that music always needs to be correct alphabetically, so in any key signature we can only have one of each, and so we have to sometimes call a black key a flat or a sharp in order to have the correct order of letters.\u00a0 The keys are made in a number of different styles and with different weights. Some are weighted, some are unweighted. The weight of the keys makes the biggest difference, but sometimes this lack of weight can allow for interesting tricks and techniques, like sliding your fingers around on an organ would be physically impossible on a hammer acoustic piano. It is important to understand these differences when you are deciding between a digital piano vs keyboard.\u00a0 Have you ever looked at the keyboard and wondered how anyone could possibly remember the names of all the notes on a keyboard piano with 88 keys? There are a few tricks to remembering all the notes on the piano key names. The first trick is to learn the patterns of the black and white piano keys. If you look at the keyboard, you will notice there is a repeating pattern of groups of 2 and 3 black keys. You can use this pattern to orient yourself in the piano scales on the keyboard.  The note C is on the outside-left of the group of 2 black keys: After that, just follow the musical alphabet up the keys until you reach C again, one octave higher! Now you know the names of all the white keys on piano. Another helpful trick is to label the note names on your keyboard. You can accomplish this with easy to remove tape. Place a small piece of tape on each of the keys and label the letter names with a pen that will not fade. That way the ink won\u2019t come off on your fingers! This is a great trick for beginners to get to know the keyboard layout quickly and efficiently. Once you\u00a0have your piano keys labeled, you can get rocking on some great tunes! From its first incarnation as the harpsichord, to the most complex synthesizer \u2013 the piano and the keyboard is one of the most important inventions in the history of western music. Understanding the keys of the piano and the process that they are named and ordered, is the first step in truly gaining mastery of all types of music, and letting you make all your musical ideas come true.\u00a0 The real piano keyboard has an amazing 88 keys.

This module provides an SPI interface to connect an SD card module with any microcontroller which supports the SPI communication interface. Using a micro SD card becomes very handy for applications where we need to store files or any data. Additionally, we will learn how to handle files in the microSD card including accessing the microSD card information and reading/writing to a file. Storage data including text, video, audio, CSV, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files can all be conveniently stored in the microSD card. It is one of the most reliable and practical ways to store data in devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and personal computers. The Arduino SD card library provides a convenient way of storing files in the microSD card which will be discussed in later sections of this tutorial. We have a similar guide with the ESP32 development board as well: MicroSD Card Module with ESP32 using Arduino IDE The microSD card Modules are designed to communicate with the MicroSD cards. These connectors provide the required hardware and pinout to connect SD cards with microcontrollers such as ESP32, Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, etc. Although, they are compatible with almost all SD cards which are commonly used in cell phones. But they can handle a maximum of 16GB capacity microSD cards and only 2GB capacity for standard SD cards. With the help of these modules, we will be able to read and write data to and from SD cards through the SPI communication protocol. There are several different types of microSD card modules easily available in the market. But, the one which we will be using in this article is shown below: This microSD card module has 6 terminals consisting of SPI and power supply terminals. Below you can view the pinout of this module with some description of the individual pins. Required Hardware: Following components are required: Now, we will show you how to connect the microSD card module and the Arduino board together. There are different versions of the Arduino boards including Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega, and Arduino Nano. The Uno/ Nano and Mega have different default SPI pins. The table below shows the default SPI pins for the three Arduino boards. You can use any of the Arduino boards mentioned above but remember to use the correct SPI pins for connection of the microSD card module and Arduino. For this article, we will be using the Arduino Uno board. The figure below shows the default SPI pins of Arduino Uno. Now let us see how to connect the microSD card module and the Arduino Uno board. The table below shows the connections between the two devices: As shown from the table, we will connect the VCC terminal of the MicroSD card module with 5V of Arduino Uno board. Both grounds will be common. The default SPI GPIO pins of Arduino Uno are being used to connect with each of the remaining SPI terminals of the microSD card module. Now, as we know how to interface the microSD card module and the Arduino Uno together let us learn how to prepare the microSD card to handle files in Arduino IDE. As we have to use our microSD card in Arduino IDE so we would have to format it as FAT32. We will have to follow a series of steps to accomplish it successfully. In this section, we will show you how to use example sketches available in the Arduino IDE. These will help us to handle files with a microSD card using Arduino Uno and  Arduino IDE. We will use the SD library examples to demonstrate the card information and some file handling functions like reading and writing on a file which will be saved on the microSD card. Open your Arduino IDE and go to File > Examples > SD > CardInfo. The following program code will open. This example sketch will recognize the microSD card and display information related to it on the serial monitor. It will help us in making sure that we are using a card which is supported.  We have modified one line in this sketch according to the board we are using. As we are using Arduino Uno, hence its default SPI CS pin is GPIO10. Therefore, make sure that \u2018chipSelect\u2019 variable is set to 10 in this case. By default it was set to 4. To see the demonstration of the above code, upload the code to Arduino. But, before uploading code, make sure to select the Arduino board from Tools > Board and also select the correct COM port to which the Arduino board is connected from Tools > Port. Once the code is uploaded to Arduino, open the serial monitor of Arduino IDE and set the baud rate to 9600. Now press the Reset button on the Arduino Uno. The Serial monitor will display some messages. Our microSD card is supported hence our card gets initialized and there is no error messages. We can view the card type as \u2018SDHC\u2019 and other parameters as well including its size and type. The volume type is FAT32. Now, if your serial monitor did not display the product ID or manufacturer ID this means that your card is not supported and is faulty. The card was unable to get initialized. Additionally, if you did not format the card to FAT32 in the beginning, it will point that error as well. Now as our microSD card is getting initialized and all is working well let us proceed with the next example sketch where we will learn to read/write on a .txt file. Open your Arduino IDE and go to File > Examples > SD > ReadWrite . The following program code will open. This example sketch will read and write data on a .txt file that will get saved on our microSD card. We have modified one line in this sketch according to the board we are using. As we are using Arduino Uno, hence its default SPI CS pin is GPIO10. Using the begin() function on the SD filesystem, we will initialize the microSD card. Therefore, make sure when initializing the microSD card replace the argument in the begin() function to 10. By default it was set to 4. Now let us understand how each part of the code works. The first step is to include all the libraries that are necessary for this project. The SD library will be used for the microSD card functionality and the SPI library will be used as we are using SPI communication protocol between the Arduino Uno board and the microSD card module. Secondly, we will create an object of File and name it \u2018myFile.\u2019 This is the object which we will use later to read and write data to our file in the microSD card. Inside the setup() function, we will open a serial connection at a baud rate of 9600. The following lines of code will initialize the microSD card using the begin() function on the SD filesystem using SD.begin(). The begin() function takes in the CS Pin as an argument which we have stated as \u201910.\u2019 Thus, it will start the SPI communication using the default SPI CS pin that is GPIO10. To change the SPI CS pin you can pass the pin number as an argument inside the begin() function. Next, we will open the test.txt file on the microSD card using SD.open() and will act as read/write. If the file does not exist, it will get created.   Using the println() function on the myFile object we will write \u2018testing 1, 2, 3.\u2019 in the test.txt file. After that, we will close the file using file.close(). This will ensure that the data written on the file gets saved as well. The serial monitor will display \u2018Writing to test.txt\u2026\u2019 and \u2018done\u2019 after the data is written. If the file is unable to open the serial monitor will display an error message. Note: print() and println() work in similar way to write strings/variable to a file print(): prints the message on the same lineprintln(): prints the message on the next line Now, we will read the data which we just wrote on our test.txt file. To do that we will first open the test.txt file by using SD.open(). Then by using Serial.write() and passing myFile.read() as an argument inside it, it will read the test.txt file and print the data in the serial monitor. Notice that we are using a while loop with myFile.available() as an argument inside it. This will make sure that  all the contents of the file are displayed on the serial monitor properly. After that, we will close the file using file.close(). If the file is unable to open the serial monitor will display an error message. Note: read() function only reads a single character at a time. To see the demonstration of the above code, upload the code to Arduino. But, before uploading code, make sure to select the Arduino board from Tools > Board and also select the correct COM port to which the Arduino board is connected from Tools > Port. Once the code is uploaded to Arduino, open the serial monitor of Arduino IDE and set the baud rate to 9600. You will be able to view the following messages if the data is successfully written to the file (highlighted in blue). The red highlighted box shows the contents of the test.txt file which are \u2018testing 1, 2, 3.\u2019 If we press the Reset button again, another set of data will get appended in the file. Open your Arduino IDE and go to File > Examples > SD > Files . The following program code will open. This example sketch will create and delete a .txt file in our microSD card. We have modified one line in this sketch according to the board we are using. As we are using Arduino Uno, hence its default SPI CS pin is GPIO10. Using the begin() function on the SD filesystem, we will initialize the microSD card. Therefore, make sure when initializing the microSD card replace the argument in the begin() function to 10. By default it was set to 4. To see the demonstration of the above code, upload the code to Arduino. But, before uploading code, make sure to select the Arduino board from Tools > Board and also select the correct COM port to which the Arduino board is connected from Tools > Port. Once the code is uploaded to Arduino, open the serial monitor of Arduino IDE and set the baud rate to 9600. At first, you can view that example.txt file did not exist in the microSD card. Hence it was first created as highlighted in red. Then it was removed from the microSD card. Open your Arduino IDE and go to File > Examples > SD > listfiles. The following program code will open. This example sketch will display all the files present in your microSD card on the serial monitor. We have modified one line in this sketch according to the board we are using. As we are using Arduino Uno, hence its default SPI CS pin is GPIO10. Using the begin() function on the SD filesystem, we will initialize the microSD card. Therefore, make sure when initializing the microSD card replace the argument in the begin() function to 10. By default it was set to 4. To see the demonstration of the above code, upload the code to Arduino.

Once the code is uploaded to Arduino, open the serial monitor of Arduino IDE and set the baud rate to 9600. As you can notice in the serial monitor, first the system files are displayed with their sizes. Next, we have three .txt files (TEST1.txt, TEST2.txt and TEST3.txt) in our microSD card which are empty as denoted by their size. The table below shows some commonly used functions with SD object that we did not cover till now. The table below shows some commonly used functions with the File object (e.g. myFile) that we did not cover till now. In conclusion, we learned how to use a micro SD card with Arduino using Arduino IDE. We looked at example sketches from the SD library and successfully initialized our microSD card. Additionally, we were able to read and write to a .txt file as well.

This political party has been in power in the Republic of India since 2014. It is the current governing political party. In terms of policy, the BJP is a right-wing party that has always supported Hindu nationalist causes. It has strong ideological and organisational ties to the much older Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (Rahtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is a nationalist organisation) (RSS). The BJP is the country's largest political party in terms of representation in the national parliament and state assemblies as of 2019, and it is by far the world's largest party in terms of primary membership, with the Communist Party of China, the country's second-largest political party, having approximately half as many members as the BJP.\n According to Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the BJP's origins may be traced back to the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, which was founded in 1951. Immediately after the declaration of a State of Emergency in 1977, the Janata Sangh joined forces with numerous other parties to create the Janata Party, which went on to beat the incumbent Congress party in the 1977 general election. After three years in power, the Janata Party was forced to split in 1980, with members of the former Jana Sangh reuniting to establish the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which continues to this day. Even though it was originally unsuccessful, gaining just two seats in the 1984 general election, the party gained in prominence as a result of the Ram Janmabhoomi campaign in India. Following victories in several state elections and improved showings in national elections, the BJP rose to become the largest party in the parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament, and its government lasted only 13 days before it was forced to resign in protest.\n Following the 1998 general election, the BJP-dominated coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), headed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, established a government that lasted for one year and was governed by him. With the help of new elections, the NDA government, led once again by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was able to complete a full term in office, becoming the first non-Congress administration to do so since Independence. Because of its surprise loss in the 2004 general election, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) became the primary opposition party, a position it would hold for the following 10 years. The state of Gujarat was led to a resounding win in the 2014 general election by long-serving Chief Minister Narendra Modi. Since then, Modi has served as Prime Minister of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which currently controls 18 states as of February 2019.\n integral humanism, which was originally articulated by Deendayal Upadhyaya in 1965, is the official philosophy of the Bharatiya Janata Party. This political party professes a dedication to Hindutva, and its policies have traditionally mirrored Hindu nationalist views in India. A social conservatism and a foreign policy based on nationalist ideals are promoted by the BJP. The abolition of the special status accorded to Jammu and Kashmir, the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and the adoption of an unified civil code have been among the main topics on which the conference has focused. None of these contentious topics were pursued by the NDA administration in power from 1998 to 2004. Instead, it emphasised a broadly liberal economic strategy that placed a higher priority on globalisation and economic development than on social welfare and welfare reform.\n"], "http://www.sundersingh.in/": [" Color Options: Menu Options: Hello, I\u2019m a UI/UX Designer & Front End Developer from Mumbai, India.

After completing her education she joined Indian National Congress. In 1954,at the age of 27,she won the Legislative Assembly election and became a minister in the Rajasthan state government. Beniwal has been a minister in successive Congress governments in Rajasthan since 1954,holding various important portfolios including home,medical and health,education and agriculture. She was the revenue minister in the Ashok Gehlot government. For a decade,from 1980 to 1990,she was a cabinet minister in the Rajasthan government. During this time she held a sheer diversity of portfolios such as Agriculture,Animal husbandry,Irrigation,Labor and Employment,Education,Art and Culture,Tourism and Integrated Rural development. In 1993 she was no longer a minister but still was elected to the Legislative Assembly from Bairath (now Viratnagar),Jaipur. She became a cabinet minister again in 1998,and was the Deputy Chief Minister of Rajasthan from 2003. In her long career she has been closely associated with the functioning of the state Congress party and is a member of the All India Congress Committee. Among the party posts she has held as the joint secretary of the Pradesh Congress Committee during 1977 elections,member of the Rajasthan Congress Executive Committee,President of the Rajasthan Mahila Congress,member of the Rajasthan Pradesh Election Committee,and then the Chairman of the Election Campaign Committee. Beniwal was a minister in the State Government of Rajasthan for an extensive period of time,holding different cabinet posts. As a minister,she has served the Rajasthan Government for nearly 50 years. She was appointed Governor of Tripura in October 2009. She was the first female governor of any state of Northeast India. [2]  A month later,she was appointed the Governor of Gujarat on 27 November 2009 where she served for more than four years. On 6 July 2014,she was transferred to the post of Governor of Mizoram. Beniwal is one of the founder members of the Co-operative Movement and different important organisations in the state of Rajasthan. She held the following positions in these organisations: Other than being a quite senior member of the Indian National Congress,Beniwal is famous as a minister of good quality,honesty,and excellent performance. She had managed all the operations of her departments with comprehensive learning and diligence. She has lucid ideas about her task and was quite energetic to muster her officials to keep high standards of operation. As Agriculture Minister of the state,she was a key functionary in the setting up of Rajasthan Agriculture University in Bikaner. As an Irrigation Minister,she completed the fabulous task of making district programmes of approximately 48,000 water harvesting plants in Rajasthan. As a result,a huge number of small,medium,and big projects are underway. This is certainly good news for farmers who suffer from drought. She had a key role in setting up the National Institute of Ayurved,at Jaipur. With her firm endeavour,she has also set up a Sanskrit University at Jaipur. Beniwal is one of the most committed and senior co-operators in India. She has served as the representative of the Rajasthan unit in National Co-operative Union of India in different ranks for nearly 20 years. As one of the limited and leading co-operators in India,Beniwal has been linked with the primary association of the All India Co-operative Union,Jorbagh,New Delhi,which is currently named as the National Co-operative Union of India (NCUI). From the very start of Co-operative Union,Beniwal was dynamically involved in the campaign to turn it into a real spokesperson establishment of the countrywide co-operative campaign. She received the Best Co-operator of India Award conferred by IFFCO in 1994 \u201395. The Lokayukta is a state-level body for monitoring the government,particularly for corruption. In August 2011,Beniwal appointed Justice R A Mehta as the Lokayukta. She did this under Section 3 of the Gujarat Lokayukta Act,1986,which gives the governor the right to appoint Lokayukta without consulting the government, [3]  when there has been a long delay in making the appointment. In so doing,Beniwal bypassed the Narendra Modi government of Gujarat,which had been sitting on the matter since 2004. Justice Mehta had been recommended by the Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court in June 2011, [4]  but the government did not act on the suggestion. In August,the father of murdered RTI activist Amit Jethwa filed Public Interest Litigation in the High Court,which then served a show cause notice on the government for the delay in the appointment of the Lokayukta. In response,the Gujarat state cabinet set up a committee of five ministers to look into the matter. [5]  The unilateral action of the governor was challenged in the Gujarat High Court by the government of Gujarat. On 18 January 2012,the Lokyukta appointment was upheld by the court. [6]  The next day,the government of Gujarat further appealed to the Supreme Court by filing a special leave petition. [7]  On 2 January 2013,the Supreme Court too upheld the appointment, [8]  while noting that the Lokayukta post lying vacant for nine years reflected a \"very sorry state of affairs\". [9]  The bench said \"the process of consultation by the Governor with the then Chief Justice stood complete,and in such a situation,the appointment of Justice Mehta cannot be held illegal\". It noted that the Governor is bound to act under the advice of the Council of Ministers,but the appointment of Justice Mehta is right as it was done in consultation with the Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court. It also observed that the Governor \"has misjudged her role and has insisted that under the Lokayukta Act,the Council of Ministers has no role to play in the appointment of the Lokayukta\". [10]  On 6 July 2014,Beniwal became governor of Mizoram. Sheila Dikshit was an Indian politician. The longest-serving Chief Minister of Delhi,as well as the longest-serving female chief minister of any Indian state,she served for a period of 15 years beginning in 1998.

It is brought into effect in a state,after passing the Lokayukta Act in respective state Legislature and a person of reputable background is nominated to the post. The post is created to quickly address grievances against the working integrity and efficiency of the government or its administration. Once appointed,Lokayukta cannot be dismissed or transferred by the government,and can only be removed by passing an impeachment motion by the state assembly,making it a powerful deterrent against corruption and mal-administration of the governing system.

Now there are nearly 700,000 in and around the metropolis. The most striking symbol of the city\u2019s rise as a surveillance hotspot is the gleaming new Command and Control Center in the posh Banjara Hills neighborhood. The 20-story tower replaces a campus where swarms of officers already had access to 24-hour, real-time CCTV and cell phone tower data that geolocates reported crimes. The technology triggers any available camera in the area, pops up a mugshot database of criminals and can pair images with facial recognition software to scan CCTV footage for known criminals in the vicinity. The Associated Press was given rare access to the operations earlier this year as part of an investigation into the proliferation of artificial intelligence tools used by law enforcement around the world. Police Commissioner C.V. Anand said the new command center, inaugurated in August, encourages using technologies across government departments, not just police. It cost $75 million, according to Mahender Reddy, director general of the Telangana State Police. Facial recognition and artificial intelligence have exploded in India in recent years, becoming key law enforcement tools for monitoring big gatherings. Police aren\u2019t just using technology to solve murders or catch armed robbers. Hyderabad was among the first local police forces in India to use a mobile application to dole out traffic fines and take pictures of people flaunting mask mandates. Officers also can use facial recognition software to scan pictures against a criminal database. Police officers have access to an app, called TSCOP, on their smartphones and tablets that includes facial recognition scanning capabilities. The app also connects almost all police officers in the city to a host of government and emergency services. Anand said photos of traffic violators and mask-mandate offenders are kept only long enough to be sure they aren\u2019t needed in court and are then expunged. He expressed surprise that any law-abiding citizen would object. \u201cIf we need to control crime, we need to have surveillance,\u201d he said. But questions linger over the accuracy and a lawsuit has been filed challenging its legality. In January, a Hyderabad official scanned a female reporter\u2019s face to show how the facial recognition app worked. Within seconds, it returned five potential matches to criminals in the statewide database. Three were men. Hyderabad has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on patrol vehicles, CCTV cameras, facial recognition and geo-tracking applications and several hundred facial recognition cameras, among other technologies, Anand said. The investment has helped the state attract more private and foreign investment, he said, including Apple\u2019s development center, inaugurated in 2016; and a major Microsoft data center announced in March. \u201cWhen these companies decide to invest in a city, they first look at the law-and-order situation,\u201d Anand said. He credited technology for a rapid decrease in crime. Mugging for jewelry, for example, plunged from 1,033 incidents per year to less than 50 a year after cameras and other technologies were deployed, he said. Hyderabad\u2019s trajectory is in line with the nation\u2019s. The country\u2019s National Crime Records Bureau is seeking to build what could be among the world\u2019s largest facial recognition systems. Building steadily on previous government efforts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have seized on the rise in surveillance technology since coming to power in 2014. His flagship Digital India campaign aims to overhaul the country\u2019s digital infrastructure to govern using information technology. The government has promoted smart policing through drones, AI-enabled CCTV cameras and facial recognition. It\u2019s a blueprint that has garnered support across the political spectrum and seeped into states across India, said Apar Gupta, executive director of the New Delhi-based Internet Freedom Foundation. \u201cThere is a lot of social and civic support for it too \u2013 people don\u2019t always fully understand,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cThey see technology and think this is the answer.\u201d ___ Jain is a former AP video journalist.

Our editors will review what you\u2019ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.  Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), English Indian People\u2019s Party,  pro-Hindu political party of postindependence India. The party has enjoyed broad support among members of the higher castes and in northern India. It has attempted to attract support from lower castes, particularly through the appointment of several lower-caste members to prominent party positions. The BJP traces its roots to the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS; Indian People\u2019s Association), which was established in 1951 as the political wing of the pro-Hindu group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS; \u201cNational Volunteers Corps\u201d) by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. The BJS advocated the rebuilding of India in accordance with Hindu culture and called for the formation of a strong unified state. In 1967 the BJS gained a substantial foothold in the Hindi-speaking regions of northern India. Ten years later the party, led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, joined three other political parties to form the Janata Party and took over the reins of government. Plagued by factionalism and internal disputes, however, the government collapsed in July 1979. The BJP was formally established in 1980, following a split by dissidents within the Janata coalition, whose leaders wanted to prohibit elected BJS officials from participating in the RSS. (Critics of the RSS have consistently accused it of political and religious extremism, particularly because one of its members had assassinated Mahatma Gandhi.) The BJS subsequently reorganized itself as the BJP under the leadership of Vajpayee, Lal Krishan Advani, and Murali Manohar Joshi. The BJP advocated Hindutva (\u201cHindu-ness\u201d), an ideology that sought to define Indian culture in terms of Hindu values, and it was highly critical of the secular policies and practices of the Indian National Congress (Congress Party). The BJP began to have electoral success in 1989, when it capitalized on anti-Muslim feeling by calling for the erection of a Hindu temple in an area in Ayodhya considered sacred by Hindus but at that time occupied by the Babri Masjid (Mosque of B\u0101bur). By 1991 the BJP had considerably increased its political appeal, capturing 117 seats in the Lok Sabha (lower chamber of the Indian parliament) and taking power in four states. The demolition of the Babri Masjid in December 1992 by organizations seen to be associated with the BJP caused a major backlash against the party. The mosque\u2019s destruction also led to violence throughout the country that left more than 1,000 dead. The party was regarded with skepticism and suspicion by many committed to secularism in contemporary India. To alleviate fear among the public, restore confidence in the party, and expand its base, the BJP\u2019s leaders undertook a series of rath yatras (\u201cjourneys on the carriage\u201d), or political marches, in which the Hindu god Rama was symbolically invoked as the symbol of cultural renaissance. In elections in 1996 the BJP emerged as the largest single party in the Lok Sabha and was invited by India\u2019s president to form a government. However, its tenure in office was short-lived, as it could not muster the majority required to rule in the 545-member lower house. In 1998 the BJP and its allies were able to form a majority government with Vajpayee as prime minister. In May of that year, nuclear weapons tests ordered by Vajpayee drew widespread international condemnation. After 13 months in office, coalition partner All India Dravidian Progressive Federation (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham) withdrew its support, and Vajpayee was prompted to seek a vote of confidence in the Lok Sabha, which he lost by the margin of a single vote. The BJP contested the 1999 parliamentary elections as the organizer of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a coalition of more than 20 national and regional parties. The alliance secured a governing majority, with the BJP winning 182 of the coalition\u2019s 294 seats. Vajpayee, as leader of the largest party in the alliance, was again elected prime minister. Although Vajpayee sought to resolve the country\u2019s long-standing conflict with Pakistan over the Kashmir region and made India a world leader in information technology, the coalition lost its majority in the 2004 parliamentary elections to the Congress Party\u2019s United Progressive Alliance (UPA) coalition, and Vajpayee resigned from office. The party\u2019s share of seats in the Lok Sabha was reduced from 137 to 116 in the 2009 parliamentary elections, as the UPA coalition again prevailed. As the 2014 Lok Sabha elections grew near, however, the BJP\u2019s fortunes began to rise, largely because of growing discontent with Congress Party rule. Narendra Modi, the longtime chief minister (head of government) of Gujarat state, was chosen to lead the BJP electoral campaign, thus making him the party\u2019s candidate for prime minister. The polling\u2014held in several stages in April and May\u2014produced an overwhelming victory for the BJP. The party won 282 seats outright, a clear majority in the chamber, and its NDA partners added 54 more. Shortly after election results were announced, Modi was named head of the party members in parliament, and he began forming a government that included not only senior BJP officials but also several leaders from parties allied with the coalition. Modi was sworn in as prime minister on May 26, 2014. BJP rule included a mixture of policies relating to the economy and to promoting Hindutva. On November 8, 2016, 500- and 1,000-rupee banknotes were demonetized with just a few hours\u2019 notice with the intent of stopping \u201cblack money\u201d\u2014cash used for illicit activities. More than 99 percent of the banknotes were returned and replaced, indicating even \u201cblack money\u201d had been successfully exchanged and returned to circulation. But the policy did broaden the income tax base through increased bank activity and stimulated the use of cashless transactions. In 2017 the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced, reforming the collection of consumption taxes nationwide. Meanwhile, the BJP appealed to notions of Hindutva through measures such as banning the sale of cows for slaughter, a move later overturned by the Supreme Court. The party likewise legislated name changes for certain jurisdictions. As both unemployment and the cost of living continued to rise and Modi\u2019s grandiose promises on economic growth remained unfulfilled, the BJP began suffering local election losses. In 2018 the party lost all five state elections held in November and December,  including those in its strongholds of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh. On the national level, however, the party was able to pull off a landslide victory in April\u2013May 2019 and even expanded its representation in the Lok Sabha. This was in part due to the support it gained after the government\u2019s handling of a security crisis in Jammu and Kashmir in February 2019. Moreover, Congress, the BJP\u2019s most viable competitor, failed to portray itself as a worthwhile alternative to the BJP-led government. Later that year, though, the BJP lost control of Maharashtra state after losing the support of a prominent regional party. The party\u2019s second term in power was marked by swift and heavy-handed actions. In August 2019 the BJP-led government stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy and in October brought the former state under the direct control of the union government. Communications and movement in the territory were severely restricted during the transition. In March 2020 the spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic prompted the government to implement a strict national lockdown until June. As restrictions were eased, the BJP made efforts to counter the economic impact of the pandemic. Those efforts included Modi\u2019s use of executive action to reduce obstacles to selling produce and to encourage private investment. Critics argued that the changes would make farmers vulnerable to exploitation, but the reforms were nevertheless codified into law without input from those concerned. Protests against the measures escalated in January 2021 (including clashes with police and the storming of the Red Fort on Republic Day), and the government took extraordinary measures to stifle them, implementing Internet blackouts and punishing organizers, participants, and journalists. Nevertheless, opposition to the reforms was sustained into November, and the BJP, wary of losing support in upcoming state elections, announced that they would be repealed."], "https://buyanessaycheaponline.com/funny-college-essays/": ["  \u00a0 \u00a0 Organizational Behavior and Criminal Justice Agencies EssayFelicia A.

Shri Mukesh Pandey, learned Counsel for the applicant.\n\nShri Akhilesh Shukla, learned Deputy Government Advocate for the\nrespondent/State.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 02.             Facts and circumstances giving rise to this case are that the\n\nprosecutrix lodged the report on dated 05.05.2011 that the accused has\n\ncommitted rape on her on dated March 15, 2009 while she was traveling\n\nby train about three years ago. The explanation for the delay was given\n                                         2                     Cr.R. No.607 of 2013\n\nthat the accused had given her threat to kill. Offence registered under\n\nSection 376, 420 and 506 of IPC, after due investigation, challan was filed.\n\n 03.          Since the case was exclusively triable by the Court of\n\nSessions, therefore, after committal the case to the Court of Sessions\n\nJudge, from where it was received in the learned trial Court for the trial.\n\nLearned trial Court, after taking into consideration the challan papers,\n\nframed charge against applicant under Section 376 of IPC, which is\n\ndenied. Against this order, the instant revision petition has been filed.\n\n 04.          Shri Mukesh Pandey, learned counsel for the applicant has\n\nsubmitted that the learned trial Court has not considered this aspect that\n\nthe prosecutrix while traveling by train accused met her and after\n\nintroduction she was subjected to sexual intercourse, such allegation\n\nthemselves are showing that she had made totally false allegations. He\n\nfurther submitted that the learned trial Court did not consider this aspect\n\nthat there is no evidence to show that the accused was traveling in the\n\ntrain. Coming to the star argument that 27 years aged prosecutrix has filed\n\nFirst Information Report after more than three years against the married\n\nemployee of the railway department that too, only on presumption,\n\napplicant is impleaded in this false and baseless case therefore, impugned\n\norder is liable to be set aside.\n 05.          Shri Akhilesh Shukla, learned Panel Lawyer for the State has\n\nopposed the revision vehemently contending that the applicant has rightly\n\nbeen charged, thus, the revision is liable to be dismissed.\n\n 06.          Considering the rival submissions made by learned counsel\n\nfor the parties and perused the record available, I am of the opinion that\n\nthis revision petition deserves to be accepted.\n \n                    The scope of Section 227 of the Code\n\n 07.          In Union of India vs. Pafulla Kumar Samal (1979) 3 SCC 4,\n\nthe scope of section 227 of the Code was considered and after adverting\n\nto various decisions, the Apex Court enumerated the following principles:\n\n              (1)    That the Judge while considering the question of\n\nframing the charges under section 227 of the Code has the undoubted\n\npower to sift and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out\n\nwhether or not a prima facie case against the accused has been made out:\n\n              (2)    Where the materials placed before the Court disclose\n\ngrave suspicion against the accused which has not been properly\n\nexplained the Court will be, fully justified in framing a charge and\n\nproceeding with the trial.\n              (3)    The test to determine a prima facie case would naturally\n\ndepend upon the facts of each case and it is difficult to lay down a rule of\n\nuniversal application. By and large however if two views are equally\n\npossible and the Judge is satisfied that the evidence produced before him\n\nwhile giving rise to some suspicion but not grave suspicion against the\n\naccused, he will be fully within his right to discharge the accused.\n\n              (4)    That in exercising his jurisdiction under section 227 of\n\nthe Code the Judge which under the present Code is a senior and\n\nexperienced Judge cannot act merely as a Post office or a mouth-piece of\n\nthe prosecution, but has to consider the broad probabilities of the case, the\n\ntotal effect of the evidence and the documents produced before the Court,\n\nany basic infirmities appearing in the case and so on. This however does\n\nnot mean that the Judge should make a roving enquiry into the pros and\n\ncons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting a trial.\n                                          4                     Cr.R. No.607 of 2013\n                     The prosecutrix consenting party\n\n 08.          Together reading the definition of rape under Section 375 and\n\nprovisions of Section 90 of the I.P.C. it is crystal clear that consent given\n\nunder fear or misconception of fact that \"for determining whether consent\n\ngiven by the prosecutrix was voluntary or under a misconception of fact,\"\n\nthere is no straitjacket formula and each case has to be decided, considering\n\nthe evidence and surrounding circumstances of that case.\n\n 09.          The prosecution came with the case that the prosecutrix\n\nboarded the train leaving for Bilaspur by Utkal Express in Coach No.S-5, at\n\nAgra Station. Two persons including accused came to her and asked to\n\nvacate the berth No.7, which she was occupying. When she introduced\n\nherself that her father late Shri Virender Kumar Dhakija was Senior Ticket\n\nChecker at Bilaspur Railway Station so accused seated near to her. During\n\nconversation accused portrayed himself unmarried and promise to marry with\n\nher. She ignored all this non-sense. During night the prosecutrix went for\n\nsleeping on Berth No.7. At that time accused who named as Jay came to her\n\nand repeated the promise of marriage and laying with her by side. At that time\n\nthe train was stationed at Bena Station. During running train accused\n\ncommitted rape on her.\n 10.          Therefore, the case of prosecution rests on sole testimony of\n\nunmarried prosecutrix. It transpires that the culprit gained intimacy with the\n\nprosecutrix and on the false promise to marry committed rape on her.\n\n 11.           'S' Coach in every train denotes the sleeper class having 72\n\nberth for passengers. Berth No.7 will be in group of 8 berths. In this situation\n\nwithout evaluating any pros and cons of this peace of evidence it is highly\n\nimprobable that rape can be performed on berth of running train.\n                                             5                  Cr.R. No.607 of 2013\n 12.           In written First Information Report version of prosecutrix was that\n\naccused had committed rape on her on Berth No.7 of sleeper coach. But, in\n\nher police statement recorded under Section 161 of the Code prosecutrix\n\nwillfully exaggerated her version stating that rape was committed with her in\n\ntoilet also to rule out this improbability, but of no use.\n\n 13.           If the prosecutrix was not willing her natural conduct would have\n\nbeen to raise alarm. It is evident from contains of F.I.R. that the prosecutrix\n\ndid not raise cry for help nor complaint about the incident to fellow\n\npassengers nor competent railway officer the Ticket Traveling Examiner\n\n( T.T.E.). If the prosecutrix would not have been a consenting party, her\n\nnormal conduct would have been to complain to fellow passengers or the\n\nT.T.E. who was attending the Coach S-5.\n 14.           Whether accused had obtained the consent of the prosecutrix by\n\nmisrepresentation? To observe it that accused had obtained the consent of\n\nthe prosecutrix by misrepresentation which is no consent under the law\n\nnothing is on record. The accused had induced prosecutrix to have sexual\n\nintercourse with promise to marry her but subsequently refused to marry her\n\nis also not on record. Therefore, on the strength of evidence which is\n\nproduced by the prosecution accepting to be true, even then no offence of\n\nsexual assault is proved as cohabitation had taken place with the consent of\n\nthe prosecutrix.\n 15.           The prosecutrix (aged 27 years on the date of occurrence) had\n\nsufficient intelligence to understand the significance and moral quality of the\n\nact she was facing. In case the prosecutrix had not been the consenting party\n\non the date of incident she would not have allowed the accused to have\n\nsexual intercourse with her in running train, that too on berth of sleeper\n\ncoach. That is the strongest 'probability factor' to show that her consent was\n                                           6                      Cr.R. No.607 of 2013\n\nnot lacking. It appears that she was fully a consenting party to the act of\n\nsexual intercourse and that explains her being tight-lipped for more than 03\n\nyears. The suppression is indicative of her being in 'flagrant-delicto'.\n\n 16.           After careful examining of prosecution evidence proposes to\n\nadduce to prove the guilt of the accused even if fully accepted, to ascertain\n\nwhether it was a case of passive submission on the face of psychological\n\npressure or allurement made by the accused or it was a conscious\n\ndecision of the prosecutrix knowing fully the nature and consequences of\n\nthe act she participated in very easily conclusion will be that it was with\n\nconsent of major prosecutrix on any angle. Please see: State of M.P. V\n\nBabbu Barkare (2005)5, SCC 413.\n                          Journey ticket not produced\n\n 17.           The burden to prove this fact beyond doubt that accused was\n\ntraveling on the date of incident by the Utkal Express is heavily rest upon the\n\nprosecution. The prosecution totally failed to shift this burden because,\n\nneither required journey ticket were recovered from the accused nor\n\nreservation chart is produced by the prosecution. On the other hand, Chief\n\nEnquiry-cum-Reservation Supervisor, Hazarrat Nizamuddin Railway Station\n\nissued certificate to the effect that reservation chart is not available for Utkal\n\nExpress for journey date 15.03.2009.\n 18.           Prosecution did not collected required journey ticket from the\n\nprosecutrix    also then, question arises how it will be proved by the\n\nprosecution that the prosecutrix was traveling in Utkal Express?\n\n            Need of test Identification Parade in sexual offence\n\n 19.           Where in a rape case from the evidence of prosecution on\n\nrecord, it was clear that the culprit was not named clearly and accurately in\n                                           7                     Cr.R. No.607 of 2013\n\nthe F.I.R. and he was living at a place miles away from the house of the\n\nprosecutrix. In such a fact situation T.I. Parade is needed to fix the identify of\n\nthe culprit.\n 20.            The culprit was not known to the prosecutrix, therefore, she\n\nmentioned his name as Jai in FIR that too, after more than three years.\n\nNo identification parade held.\n 21.            One unknown person committed rape on a 27 years old\n\nunmarried woman when she was travelling in a train but, no T.I. Parade was\n\nheld and given cell phone number found third person's. Now she will\n\nrecognize the stranger culprit in trial Court while she will be examined after\n\nlapse of more than four years, on the basis of this dock identification the\n\nculprit could not be convicted.\n 22.            Mentioning of Cell Phone No.09752114264 in written First\n\nInformation Report is also at all not evidence hence, not of any use. It is\n\npertinent to mention here that the owner of this sim card number is a third\n\nperson Suresh Kumar so, it is also improbable that how accused will be\n\nconnected on the basis of this cell phone number with the crime?\n\n                       Delayed F.I.R. in sexual offences\n\n23             The incident were happened on 15.03.2009 in train Utkal\n\nExpress and matter was reported after delay of more than 3 years on dated\n\n15.05.2012 by the prosecutrix at Police Station GRP Bena, District Sagar.\n\n 24.            In State of Himachal Pradesh vs. Prem Singh, AIR 2009 SC\n\n1010 = 2009 AIR SCW 105, the Supreme Court considered the issue and\n\nobserved as under:\n \n \n             Please also see, Satpal Singh vs. State of Haryana, 2010 (4)\n\nCriLJ 4283 (SC).\n 25.         In a rape case the prosecutrix remains worried about her\n\nfuture. She remains in traumatic State of mind. The family of the victim\n\ngenerally shows reluctance to go to the police station because of society's\n\nattitude to words such a woman. It casts doubts and shame upon her\n\nrather than comfort and sympathies with her. Family remains concern\n\nabout its honour and reputation of the prosecutrix. After only having a cool\n\nthought it is possible for the family to lodge a complaint in sexual offence.\n\nVide Karnel Sing vs. State of M.P., AIR 1995 SC 2472 = 1995 AIR SCW\n\n3644; and State of Punjab vs. Gurmeet Singh & Ors., AIR 1996 SC 1393 =\n\n1996 AIR SCW 998.\n 26.         Any unmarried girl on account of her bashfulness and the\n\ncircumstance that not only her own honour but that of her family was at\n\nstake, would have been extremely reluctant and loath to disclose to the\n\npolice, her traumatic experience of being raped. It is only after efflux of\n\ntime, when she is able to get over a part of her trauma, will she think of\n\nlodging the F.I.R. Therefore, no mathematical time limit in lodging an F.I.R.\n\ncan be fixed in Cases of rape. Courts in such Cases should adapt a\n\nrealistic approach rather than one which is unimaginative and theoretical.\n\n 27.         The FIR is not a be-all and end-all of the matter, though it is\n\nundoubtedly, a very important document. F.I.R. in criminal Case is an\n                                         9                    Cr.R. No.607 of 2013\n\nextremely vital and valuable piece of evidence for the purpose of\n\ncorroborating the oral evidence adduced at the trial.\n\n 28.          It is well settled by the Supreme Court that a mere delay itself\n\ncannot be a ground to disbelieve the entire case of the prosecution. It is\n\nonly in such of those cases where the delay is enormous and the same\n\nremains unexplained and that there are also circumstances to suspect the\n\ngenuineness of the contents of the FIR, the Court can doubt the case of\n\nthe prosecution and then discard the case of the prosecution.\n\n 29.          Mere delay in thus not fatal to the prosecution. The effect of\n\ndelay is to be understood in the light of the plausibility of the explanation\n\nforthcoming and must depend for consideration on all the facts and\n\ncircumstances of a given Case. Apren Joseph v. State of Kerala, AIR 1973\n\nSC 1: 1973 CrLJ 185.\n 30.          When the explanation for delay in giving the F.I.R. is\n\nsatisfactory the delay is not significante. Lalai v. State of U.P. AIR 1974 SC\n\n2118 : 1974 CrLJ 1393; Jadunath Singh v. State of U.P., AIR 1972 SC 116\n\n: 1972 CrLJ 29.\n 31.          When delay in lodging F.I.R. is not deliberate, it is of no\n\nconsequence. Saktu v. State of U.P., AIR 1973 SC 760 : 1973 CrLJ 599 :\n\n(1973) 1 SCC 202 : 1973 SCC (Cr) 307.\n 32.          No duration of time in the abstract can be fixed as reasonable\n\nfor giving information, the question of reasonable time being a matter for\n\ndetermination by the Court in each Case. Ram v. State of U.P., AIR 1974\n\nSC 606 : 1974 CrLJ 479.\n 33.          The delay of one or two days in lodging the FIR may be\n\nbonafide, reasonable and justified. This is naturally in view of the social\n                                         10                     Cr.R. No.607 of 2013\n\nconditions prevailing in India where a victim of rape case has to think\n\nseriously before giving the information to the Police for fear of onslaught of\n\nsocial stigma that may haunt her for life. But, the delay for more than three\n\nyears in lodging the F.I.R. in any case cannot be bonafide, reasonable and\n\njustified, on the other hand this delay is fatal for the prosecution.\n\n 34.          The Supreme Court in case of Dilawar Singh vs. State of\n\nDelhi, 2007 CriLJ 4709 (SC) held that - in criminal trial one of the cardinal\n\nprinciples for the Court is to look for plausible explanation for the delay in\n\nlodging the report. Delay sometimes affords opportunity to the complainant\n\nto make deliberation upon the complaint and to make embellishment or\n\neven make fabrications. Delay defeats the chance of the unsoiled and\n\nuntarnished version of the case to be presented before the Court at the\n\nearliest instance. That is why if there is delay in either coming before the\n\npolice or before the Court, the Courts always view the allegations with\n\nsuspicion and look for satisfactory explanation. If no such satisfaction is\n\nformed, the delay is treated as fatal to the prosecution case.\n\n                               Medical evidence\n\n 35.          Prosecutrix was medically examined on 15.05.2012 at District\n\nHospital Sagar by Dr. Yogmaya. What will be the evidentarory value of this\n\nevidence when the prosecution medically examined prosecutrix after lapse of\n\nmore than 3 years, in case of rape? it can be very well presumed by any\n\nprudent person. Resultantly, Doctor written the answer in her report that she\n\ndid not find any injury either external or internal of the person of the\n\nprosecutrix, therefore, no definite opinion can be given regarding resent rape\n\non the prosecutrix.\n \n 36.          Applicant also medically examined by Dr. O.P. Rai                on\n\n06.12.2012 at District Hospital Sagar, which is a sheer formality rather, waste\n\nproduct of valuable powers of investigation agency.\n\n 37.          Statements of Smt. B. Karmakar, Smt. Ushabai were recorded\n\nby the Investigation Officer, during which these railway employees nothing\n\nstated against the applicant. On the other hand, they have supported by\n\nnarrating this fact that railway employee applicant is saying that he is being\n\ninvolved by unknown lady in false case of rape.\n               Heinous offence vs false and frivolous cases\n\n 38.          The Supreme Court in case of Rang Bahadur Singh v State of\n\nU.P. (2000) 3 SCC 454 : 2000 CrLJ 1718, has observed that there is no\n\ndoubt about it that the rape is a heinous offence not only against the entire\n\nsociety. While remembering such point, the court must also guard\n\nagainst false and frivolous cases. A criminal court cannot afford to\n\ndeprive liberty of a person, perhaps life only liberty, without having at\n\nleast a reasonable level of certainty that the accused was the real\n\nculprit.                                                    (Emphasis given)\n\n                   When accused should be discharged\n\n 39.          Section 227 of the Code provides that 'the Judge shall\n\ndischarge when he considers that there is no sufficient ground for\n\nproceeding against the accused'. The word 'ground' in the context is not a\n\nground for conviction, but a ground for putting the accused on trial. At this\n\nstage, he is not to see as to whether the trial will end in conviction or not.\n\nThe broad test to be applied is whether the materials on record, if\n\nunrebutted, make a conviction reasonably possible.\n                                       12                   Cr.R. No.607 of 2013\n 40.         The Supreme Court has observed that Section 227 of the\n\nCode has made a beneficent provision to save the accused from\n\nprolonged harassment which is necessary concomitant of a protracted\n\ncriminal trial. Please see : Kewal Krishan v. Suraj Bhan and another, AIR\n\n1980 SC 1780: 1980 CrLJ 1271; State v. Ramesh AIR 1977 SC\n\n2018:1977 CrLJ 1606.\n 41.         If the evidence of the prosecution cannot show that the\n\naccused committed the offence, the accused should be discharged.\n\nPlease see Ramesh Singh case (supra) and also see : Union of India v.\n\nPrafulla Kumar Samal (1979) 3 SCC 4 : 1979 CrLJ 154 and Satish\n\nMehra v Delhi Adminstration (1996) 9 SCC 766: (1996) 3 Crimes 85\n\n(SC).\n 42.         The prosecution, having regard to the right of an accused to\n\nhave a fair investigation, fair inquiry and fair trial as adumbrated under\n\nArt.21 of the Constitution of India, cannot at any stage be deprived of\n\ntaking advantage of the materials which the prosecution itself have placed\n\non record. If upon perusal of the entire materials on record, the court\n\narrives at an opinion that two views are possible, charges can be framed,\n\nbut if only one and one view is possible to be taken favouring the accused,\n\nthe court shall not put the accused to harassment by asking him to face a\n\ntrial. Please see : State of Maharashtra v. Som Nath (1996) 4 SCC 659.\n\nIn the case at hand, if the Court allowed to asking applicant face the trial\n\non above discussed evidence, definitely it will amount to put the applicant\n\nfor harassment.\n 43.         Legal position that emerges from above discussed judicial\n\npronouncements of the Apex Court, there can not be any doubt that the\n                                              13                    Cr.R. No.607 of 2013\n\n      charge can be quashed if the evidence which the prosecutor proposes to\n\n      adduce to prove the guilt of applicant, even if fully accepted before, it is\n\n      challenged by cross examination or rebutted by defence evidence, if any,\n\n      cannot show that applicant committed the offence for which he is charged.\n\n       44.          After examining the documentary as well as the oral evidence\n\n      which the prosecutor proposes to adduce to prove the guilt of applicant,\n\n      even if fully accepted before, it is challenged by cross examination or\n\n      rebutted by defence evidence, if any, is not showing that applicant\n\n      committed the offence punishable under Section 376 of the I.P.C. for\n\n      which he is charged, because, (i) it is highly improbable that rape can be\n\n      performed on berth of running train, (ii) on the other hand, no offence of\n\n      sexual assault is proved as cohabitation had taken with the consent of the\n\n      prosecutrix, (iii) required journey tickets not produced, (iv) there test\n\n      identification parade was must, but not held, (v) evidentory value of\n\n      medical evidence is zero and top of these (vi) F.I.R. lodged after delay of\n\n      more than three years, that too, without explaining bonafide and\n\n      reasonable justification which is fatal for the prosecution case.\n\n       45.          In view of above, the learned trial Court committed a mistake\n\n      of law in framing charge against applicant therefore, this revision petition\n\n      succeeds and impugned order dated 20.03.2013 passed by learned First\n\n      Additional Sessions Judge Khurai, District Sagar framing charge\n\n      punishable under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code against applicant\n\n      Sunder Singh is quashed.\n                                                                   Revision allowed.\n \n\n                                                    (Subhash Kakade)\n

RocTool emerged almost a decade ago at the JEC composites show in France, and until recently its technology for rapidly heating a mold\u2019s surface to high temperatures using an inductive heating method patented by the firm has seen use only in some composite plastics processing.

We have estimated\nJashodaben's net worth\n, money, salary, income, and assets. In February 2015, Jashodaben hosted some Christian missionaries who invited her to join their missionary to help lots of destitute and helpless Hindus by teaching Gita and Ramayana to them. In June 2015, Jashodaben was scheduled to speak at a conference on politics organized by supporters of Modi. Event organizers reported that the conference was shut down on day 2 of the week-long program on the direction of the BJP leader Amit Shah and others. No reason was given for cancelling the conference, but people in attendance claimed Jashodaben's presence as the cause.  In November 2015, Jashodaben applied for a passport in order to visit relatives and friends overseas. As she was unable to produce a marriage certificate or a joint affidavit from her husband, the application was rejected by the regional passport office as \"incomplete.\" Her brother Ashok stated that a legal option was being considered.  In December, the Intelligence Bureau denied her request for information about orders, saying that the law has an exemption which applies in this case. Jashodaben uses the name \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\", which is her married name. The letter was addressed to \"Jashodaben, daughter of Chimanlal Modi\" (her father's name). At the end of December 2014, Jashodaben filed an appeal to the refusal. In addition to the appeal, Jashodaben complained that the government officers changed her name from \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\" to her maiden name \"Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi\". Doordarshan, India's public television broadcaster, presented Jashodaben on television 1 January 2015 to hear her comments on the issue. As a result of this broadcast, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting chastised staff at Doordashan and transferred the director of the broadcast from Ahmedabad to Port Blair 2,500 km away. On 6 February Jashodaben's request was again denied, and again addressed to \"Jashodaben, Chimanlal Modi's daughter\".  In May 2015, Jashodaben filed a third request for the information about the security detail and their orders. She also complained that she had completed the forms using her legal name, \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\", but the government office replied to her using her maiden name. In response to the filing, a government representative said, \"If they are still not satisfied by the information given by the first appellate authority, they can file the second appeal at the Gujarat Information Commission.\" In response to the RTI request, commentator on women's issues Shobhaa De called Jashodaben a \"superhero\" and \"plucky\", and said that her actions were \"bold, blunt, and to the point\".  In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi contested the Vadodara seat of the Parliament of India. Under the Representation of the People Act, Modi was asked to declare any previous marriage. In his response, for the first time in public and media, Modi acknowledged that he had a wife. Previously Modi had not responded to official documents asking about a spouse.  In summer 2014, Congress party politician Ajay Rai filed a lawsuit to be heard by the Allahabad High Court complaining, among other things, that Modi did not give the permanent account number of Jashodaben.  In June 2014, at what has been described as \"her first public event\", Jashodaben attended the public funeral of politician Gopinath Munde. In November 2014, she made her first trip to Mumbai where she prayed for her husband at the Mahalakshmi Temple and the Siddhivinayak Temple.  From May 2014, police from the Mehsana district began providing continual police protection for Jashodaben. The security agent team following her was assigned as a response to the Special Protection Group Act, which says that the spouse of the Prime Minister of India should receive police protection. The Salaries and Allowances of Ministers' Act describes other benefits which are typically given to spouses of prime ministers.  In November 2014, Jashodaben filed a Right to Information Act (RTI) request seeking details about her security and rights as the spouse of the prime minister. Various media organizations in India reported the RTI in different ways, including emphasizing Jashodaben's fear, the financial implications of her complaint, the guards' demands to be treated as guests, or the case as an example of female independence. Jashodaben has said that her security details suggest she refrain from talking with the media. The Gulf News reported that her security guards are primarily with her to conduct surveillance on her. Jashodaben's family has complained that her guards do not keep any identity cards, refuse to identify themselves, and refuse to name the person or office supervising them.  In 1992, Jashodaben refused to be interviewed by the newspaper Abhiyan when that publication presented a story on the marriage of her and Modi. In 2009, a reporter for Open found Jashodaben in her village and asked her some questions. In 2014, a reporter for The Indian Express interviewed her. In May 2014, TV9 Gujarat video interviewed her. In December 2014, a writer for Pakistani news agency Dawn News said that not many newspapers have had the courage to report the troubles which Jashodaben has experienced.  Jashodaben studied further to become a teacher at primary school, and from 1978\u20131990 taught in Banaskantha district. In 1991 she moved to Rajosana village and remains there. She is retired and her pension is \u20b9 14,000 (US$200) per month. One commentator said that her low salary would have made much of life a hardship for her. In talking about her relationship with Modi, in one interview Jashodaben said \"We have never been in touch... There has been no communication from his end to this day.\" In a later interview Jashodaben said that until 1987 she and Modi spoke \"normally\". Jashodaben lives with her brother Ashok and his wife in Unjha.  Narendra Modi and Jashodaben had an arranged marriage in the custom of the Ghanchi caste of Vadnagar. When Modi was thirteen, the couple underwent the religious ceremony of marriage. Per their family custom, they began living together (gauna) when Modi was 18 (jasodaben was 16) in 1968 but that period was brief.  Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi (n\u00e9e Chimanlal Modi; born January 1952) is a retired Indian teacher and the wife of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Their traditional marriage was arranged in Vadnagar by their families. The couple married in 1968. He did not officially acknowledge this marriage until 2014 during his campaign. Jashodaben continues to identify herself as the wife of Narendra Modi. She completed her education and had a career as a teacher.  Jashodaben was born in 1952.

The thermal stability of Sb2Te3 was improved obviously with the crystallization temperature elevated 60 K after Se doping, for the enhanced charge localization and stronger bonding energy, which was validated by the Vienna ab initio simulation package calculations. Based on the ultra-stability of STSe, the STSe-based phase change memory shows 65 000 reversible phase change ability. Moreover, the assembled flexible device can show real-time monitoring and recoverability response in sensing human activities in different parts of the body, which proves its effective reusability and potential as wearable electronics. Most importantly, the STSe device presents remarkable working reliability, reflected by excellent endurance over 100 s and long retention over 100 h. These results paved a novel way to utilize STSe phase change materials for flexible memory and wearable electronics with extreme thermal and mechanical stability and brilliant performance.\n     \n\n          Keywords:\n        \n      \n      Sb2TexSe3\u2212x; phase change materials; phase change memory; ultra-stability; wearable electronics.\n     NCBI Literature Resources \nMeSH\nPMC\nBookshelf\nDisclaimer\n Connect with NLM National Library of Medicine\n8600 Rockville Pike\n                  Bethesda, MD 20894 Web Policies\nFOIA\nHHS Vulnerability Disclosure Help\nAccessibility\nCareers"], "https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/33221/why-are-grand-pianos-usually-black": [" \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStack Exchange network consists of 181 Q&A communities including Stack Overflow, the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t Music: Practice & Theory Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for musicians, students, and enthusiasts.

Upright pianos are often covered with transparent lacquer, revealing their natural brown wood colour. This is similar to violins, guitars and other classical instruments, where wood structure is clearly visible. Contrary to that, when going to classical concerts, I've never seen grand pianos other than black. Is there any specific reason for it? Not particularly true! I've just sold a grand in mahogany. However, one of my theories could cover grands as well as guitars. I feel that if a solid guitar is made from a good looking, well grained piece(s) of wood, it's best just to lacquer it, so the good looks come through. If it's not that good - use a solid colour on it, and nobody will know! Grand pianos, especially concert grands, use large areas of wood - the top particularly, and to match several pieces of wood is not easy. It can be done, but at a cost. So, put a solid colour on. Why black? It fits with most things, as does the other less common colour - white.  Contrary to that, when going to classical concerts, I've never seen\n  grand pianos other than black. This is likely to follow the convention of 'concert black' attire. In more formal concerts, musicians will uniform to sharp monochrome colors typically white tuxes, black bowtie, with black pants or black skirts, black shoes. The piano then fits that convention. Similar is seen with woodwind instruments. Metallic instruments (flute, brass, tympani) are the only consistent exception which I know of. It's not always necessary to conform to this convention, but since stageworthy pianos tend to be in the tens-to-hundreds of thousands of dollars, a venue may play it safe with concert black for their only piano. Going deeper into technical theatre concepts, black is a favorite stage color as it can be used to defer attention to -and accentuate- more brightly-colored objects on stage. So anything uninteresting is draped in black like shoes, piano body, and stage floor. More interesting parts are white, like the piano keys and musicians. With the exception of flute, instruments tend to be darker in the front rows (piano, oboe, clarinet, and some piccolo) and brighter toward the back (tuba, trumpet, harp, snare). This probably has some relation to balancing audience attention, if not already some tendency for louder instruments to be metallic. Though some cite aesthetic reasons for a piano's color, it actually has nothing to do with appearance, but rather economy. Before Bartolomeo Cristofori invented the first piano at the turn of the 18th century, there existed several predecessors; chief among them, the clavichord, which I will discuss in greater detail in a moment. Up until the development of the clavichord, most keyboard-like instruments after early harpsichords were hand-painted, extremely ornate pieces of visual as well as sound art.  Though originally simply adorned and sheltered in simple wooden cases, ornate decoration developed in Northern Europe as a profitable means of work for regional artists.   The invention of the clavichord changed the market.  Due the compact, lightweight (comparably) design, and use of cheaper wood, the price went down as they exploded in popularity.  People that lived in tiny Viennese apartments were now able to have their own instrument that fit - and be able to afford to have one!  Painting a piano a solid color is astronomically cheaper than hiring professional artists to hand-paint each instrument.  You don't need to be an artist to paint something black.  In addition, black is the the cheapest color to manufacture - it (along with other dark colors) has always been associated as colors of the poor - people who couldn't afford to purchase the more rare / expensively dyed colorful cloths. So most pianos are black because it was easier / cheaper for companies to manufacture them.   As a corollary to this topic, it is actually also the same reason why many harpsichord manuals have reversed key colors.  Ivory was extremely expensive to haul to Europe from Africa, and manufacturers realized that if they made most of the keys made out of wood and only a few out of ivory, the could significantly lower the cost of their instruments, and in turn, significantly lower the cost of their overhead for ivory. Today, obviously using ivory is illegal, so all piano keys are made out of wood. You're unlikely to see a classical piano concert with a piano that is anything but black.  One of the reasons is that 95% of all concert pianists are Steinway Artists.  Another reason is that black Steinways are the least expensive. A Steinway artist has to have a performing career, agrees to feature the words \"Steinway Piano\" on his programs, and agrees to exclusively use Steinway pianos in public performances.  In exchange for this, Steinway guarantees to make a piano available (for a price) at any concert he plays.   To accomplish this, Steinway has its dealers participate in the Concert and Artist program, maintaining a separate inventory of several C&A pianos, and handling maintenance, tuning, pickup and delivery.  Now, since black Steinways are the least expensive (see Tim's answer for why), it follows that a dealer will provide only black pianos for concerts.  The current list price for \"Satin Ebony\" is currently $157,379, whereas Mahogany, the cheapest wood finish, is $182,700, so we're not talking about small numbers here. An exception you might see is this one:  This is Steinway's 500,000th commemorative piano, which sometimes makes the rounds.  I got to attend a concert with Ruth Laredo playing it soon after it was made, and it is the only classical piano concert I've ever attended where the piano wasn't black.  (In fact, it was a two-piano concert, and the other one was black.) Classical pianists are much less concerned with appearance than they are with tone, so they don't really care what color the piano is for the most part.  If a concert pianist fell in love with the tone of a piano that wasn't black, and had the means to be able to ship it to all of his concerts, then maybe you would see a concert on a differently-colored piano.  The only ones I can think of who used their own pianos are Horowitz, whose Steinway was black (still is, actually), and Victor Borge and his B\u00f6sendorfer, which was also black. In the end, I'd say that the reason that big-time rockers have a lot of different-colored pianos is because they have enough money to buy whatever piano they want and ship it wherever they want. Making a grand piano top from a single piece of wood is not feasible or requires a lot of effort and material costs because of size and weight and consequently stability against warping, so an intransparent and robust finish is desirable anyway.  Black is the color that shows least signs of aging: it doesn't get yellowish or anything. Stienway started  or promoted the tradition that became habit and tradition. white and natural wood are no uncommon. Gershwin popularized it. and it hids dirt better.   It is highly practical marketing issue.\nSame like with t-shirts or what ever. People like crazy stuff (colors etc.), but you see them later leaving the shop with black t-shirt. And it is the same with pianos. \nIf you have piano in this or that color, and you would like to sell it, people will be like.. \"hmm I like this piano how it sounds, but the color... it doesn't matches to my taste, sofa what ever.. and they buy something neutral, a next black piano, no matter that it sound worst. Same on stage, If you have highly extravagant piano on stage it will take all focus on it self. Plus you wanna play on the pianos wide variety of music and try to play romantic music on a piano that looks like Porsche and later Jazz... You will rather have a neutrally looking instrument that suits all musical styles and doesn't make you think of the connection between the piano look and the music. In other words pianos are black because it happens to be the less distracting and widely fitting color that \"doesn't\" influence the meaning of the music.

The system is overseen by the Cabinet Office Honours and Appointments Secretariat, and British nationals or citizens of the 15 Commonwealth realms can be nominated. The honours list consists of knights and dames, appointments to the Order of the British Empire and gallantry awards to servicemen and women, and civilians. The Foreign Office has responsibility for the Diplomatic Service and Overseas List, which recognises service overseas, or service in the UK with a substantial international component. And honorary awards for foreign nationals are recommended by the foreign secretary.  Nominations, submitted either by government departments or members of the public, are divided into subject areas and assessed by committees of independent experts and senior civil servants. Their assessments are passed to a selection committee that produces the list, independently of government, before it is submitted to the Queen through the prime minister. The Queen informally approves the list and letters are sent to each nominee. Once a nominee accepts the proposed honour, the list is formally approved. The honours are published in the official Crown newspaper, the London Gazette, twice a year - at new year, and in mid-June on the date of the Queen's official birthday. The Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood at St James's Palace then arranges investitures for the recipients to be presented with their medals by the Queen or other members of the Royal Family. Private nominations, made by individuals or by representatives of organisations to the Cabinet Office, traditionally make up about a quarter of all recommendations. The honours list does not cover peerages. Since 2000, peers nominated by political parties have been vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. The commission is also involved in making recommendations for non-party affiliated peerages. An outgoing prime minister has the right to draw up a dissolution or resignation honours list on leaving office. The honours committees do not assess the list although it is submitted to the Cabinet Office for \"probity and propriety checks\". In the case of peerages, the House of Lords Appointments Commission vets the list.  A Parliamentary and Political Services Committee made up of a majority of independent members and the chief whips of the three major parties was set up in 2012 to consider honours for politicians and for political service. In recent years, political donations made by a number of recipients have become the subject of particular scrutiny.   In a November 2011 response to a parliamentary committee's inquiry into the honours system, the Cabinet Office noted that all candidates for senior awards are \"checked against the lists of donations maintained and made public by the Electoral Commission\". It added: \"The Main Honours Committee must satisfy itself that a party political donation has not influenced the decision to award an honour in any way.\" In the same year the Commons Public Administration Committee urged the government to review the way the honours system is administered, calling on ministers to set up independent bodies to nominate recipients for awards and decide when they should be withdrawn. The Honours Forfeiture Committee considers cases where a recipient's actions \"raise the question of whether they should be allowed to continue to be a holder of the honour\". The Queen's art adviser Anthony Blunt was stripped of his knighthood in 1979 after being revealed as a Soviet spy, and former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin, who was heavily criticised over his role in the bank's near-collapse, had his knighthood removed in 2012.  Entertainer Rolf Harris lost his CBE in March 2015 following his conviction for indecent assault. Meanwhile, a list of 277 people who had turned down honours between 1951 and 1999, and who had since died, was made public by the Cabinet Office following a BBC Freedom of Information request. It included authors Roald Dahl, JG Ballard and Aldous Huxley, and the painters Francis Bacon, Lucien Freud and LS Lowry.  Others reported to have turned down an honour in more recent years include David Bowie, Nigella Lawson and  comedy duo Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders. Knights and Dames The honour of knighthood comes from the days of medieval chivalry, as does the method used to confer the knighthood - the accolade, or the touch of a sword by the sovereign. A knight is styled \"Sir\" and their wives \"Lady\". Women receiving the honour are styled \"Dame\" but do not receive the accolade. The honour is given for a pre-eminent contribution in any field of activity. The rank of Knight Commander (KBE) or Dame Commander (DBE), Order of the British Empire, appears on the Diplomatic Service and Overseas list.  The Order of the Bath The Order of the Bath is an order of chivalry and was founded in 1725 for service of the highest calibre. The order has a civil and military division and is awarded in the following ranks: Knight Grand Cross (GCB), Knight Commander (KCB) and Companion (CB). The Order takes its name from the symbolic bathing which, in former times, was often part of the preparation of a candidate for knighthood. Order of St Michael and St George This Order was founded by King George III in 1818 and is awarded to British subjects who have rendered extraordinary and important services abroad or in the Commonwealth. Ranks in the Order are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCMG), Knight or Dame Commander (KCMG or DCMG) and Companion (CMG). Order of the Companions Honour This is awarded for service of conspicuous national importance and is limited to 65 people. Recipients are entitled to put the initials CH after their name. Orders of the British Empire King George V created these honours during World War One to reward services to the war effort by civilians at home and service personnel in support positions. The ranks are Commander (CBE), Officer (OBE), and Member (MBE). They are now awarded for prominent national or regional roles and to those making distinguished or notable contributions in their own specific areas of activity. British Empire Medal The medal was founded in 1917 and was awarded for \"meritorious\" actions by civilians or military personnel, although the recipients did not attend a royal investiture. Scrapped in 1993 by former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, as part of his drive towards a \"classless\" society, the BEM was revived in 2012. Royal Victorian Order By 1896, prime ministers and governments had increased their influence over the distribution of awards and had gained almost total control of the system. Therefore, Queen Victoria instituted The Royal Victorian Order as a personal award for services performed on behalf of the Royal Family. The ranks are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCVO), Knight or Dame Commander (KCVO or DCVO), Commander (CVO), Lieutenant (LVO) and Member (MVO). Royal Victorian Medal Associated with the Royal Victorian Order is the Royal Victorian Medal which has three grades: gold, silver and bronze. The circular medal is attached to the ribbon of the Order. Royal Red Cross Founded in 1883 by Queen Victoria, the award is confined to the nursing services. Those awarded the first class are designated \"Members\" (RRC): those awarded the Second Class are designated \"Associates\" (ARRC). Queen's Police Medal Awarded for distinguished service in the police force. Queen's Fire Service Medal Given to firefighters who have displayed conspicuous devotion to duty. Queen's Ambulance Service Medal Awarded for distinguished service in the ambulance service.

The Indian market for network cameras is growing swiftly, as the enterprises, small and medium businesses and end customers are looking at surveillance technologies as a prime necessity.\nThe consumption of security products in the residential segment is also increasing rapidly. With the demand for video surveillance going up in this segment, the Indian security and surveillance industry is expected to touch a turnover of US$ 615 million by 2018.\nAs per the figures of IHS Technology, a US based research firm, the market size of video surveillance equipment (CCTV cameras) in India was US$ 306 million in 2013. The companies manufacturing the equipment have now started eyeing the residential segment, besides the usual government and commercial segments.\nThe report further states that China dominates the industry with 35 per cent of the global market share\u00a0while India ranks among the top 10 countries with just about 5 per cent of market share. The study states: \u201cThe market for video surveillance equipment in India is witnessing strong tailwinds, and growth is predicted to accelerate throughout the period to 2018. India has the potential to be among the top three countries in the next few years. About 10 million CCTV camera units are supplied every year in the country.\u201d\nGanesh Jivani, MD and CEO, Matrix Comsec, adds his views on the fastest moving category of CCTVs. He says, \u201cThe highest revenue currently comes from analogue cameras. However, there is a very clear and strong shift from analogue to IP cameras. The fastest moving product categories in this domain are IP cameras and visitor management systems (VMS), which allow the connection of unlimited cameras to one server along with video analytics like camera tampering detection, intrusion detection, and missing object and motion detection.\u201d\nCCTV manufacturing companies are major buyers of electronic components. Highlighting the procurement challenges faced by CCTV companies, Jivani says that electronic components are an integral part of surveillance products, but the challenge is that even basic good quality components are not available in India, and this makes room for imports. Electronics Bazaar has made an attempt to identify the leading CCTV camera companies in India by studying their growth patterns and latest revenues. Most of the leading players declined to share their India-specific revenues with the EB team, due to which it became challenging to rank the \u2018Top 10\u2019 companies in this segment. Therefore, we have listed leading companies who are into the security and surveillance business with CCTV cameras as their major product.

The 10-day session witnessed a stormy beginning as the Basavaraj Bommai-administration unveiled the portrait of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar in its assembly hall amid huge protest by the opposition.  The session is important for both the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress, as the joint session and the budget remain to be held before the elections are announced, which are due in May 2023. The three political parties \u2013 BJP, Congress and the JDS \u2013 are also likely to attack and counter each other on a host of issues before setting the tone for the assembly elections. Here are some of the top issues that the BJP has spoken about and is also likely to table the in the Belagavi session: The Karnataka assembly speaker Vishwanath Hedge Kageri unveiled the portrait of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, a Hindutva ideologue, inside the assembly hall in Belagavi, leading to massive protests by opposition parties on the steps outside the Suvarna Soudha building.  So what is the BJP\u2019s defence? \"What happens inside assembly is the prerogative of the speaker.\" Defending Savarkar's portrait in the assembly the BJP leaders also said, \"Savarkar\u2019s contribution to the nation\u2019s is known to all.\" \"Congress\u2019s opposition to Savarkar is only limited to his links with Hindu Mahasabha.\" Congress protest against unveiling of VD Savarkar's portrait insider assembly building in Suvarna Soudha in Belagavi. (Photo: Accessed by The Quint)  Meanwhile the Congress's Siddaramaiah alleged, \"The choice to have Savarkar\u2019s photo was a unilateral decision.\" \"What is the need for erecting a painting of the person accused in Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s assassination?\" \"Bommai government wants to divert attention of the people from real issues like law and order.\" The protest was led by Siddaramaiah, leader of opposition in Karnataka, who was joined by Congress MLAs who held photos of Valmiki, Kanaka Dasa, Basavanna, Kuvempu,\u00a0 BR Ambedkar and Sardar Patel in opposition.\u00a0 Another raging dispute that the Karnataka assembly is likely to discuss is the border row with neighbouring Maharashtra.  The tension between the two states heightened as hundreds of volunteers from the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti and leaders from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) staged protests near the Kognoli Toll Plaza near Belagavi. However, the law and order situation was brought to control with:  Police imposing CrPc Section 144. Stopping of many NCP and Shiva Sena leaders from entering Karnataka. NCP and Shiva Sena leaders stopped near the border in Belagavi as Karnataka begins the winter session of its assembly. (Photo: Accessed by The Quint) The Karnataka BJP's stand on the matter is very clear. CM Bommai said, \"State government is fully prepared for a legal battle in the Supreme Court against Maharashtra.\" \"Sharad Pawar's dream will not become a reality  despite politicising the matter.  Meanwhile, the Congress's Siddaramaiah has accused the BJP of: \"Not resolving the matter despite BJP being in power in Karnataka, Maharashtra and the centre.\" \"Using border row to influence election in May 2023.\" Yielding to growing demand by Hindutva and some right-wing hardline outfits, BJP MLC N Ravi Kumar is all set to introduce a private member's bill, seeking\u00a0blanket ban on halal certification. The Bommai government's stand on the matter is still unclear, with the CM stating that the private member bill has its own position.  But the BJP's general secretary has claimed, \"Muslim organisations do not have the right to certify products.\" \"Halal certification is being issued illegally.\" \"Crores of rupees collected in the name of halal certificates are being used to fund illegal activities.\" A protest was held in Bengaluru by the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti and pro-Hindu organisations demanding the ban on halal certificates and the establishment of an anti-love jihad police force in the next winter session. (Photo: Accessed by The Quint) On the contrary, the opposition Congress has requested the speaker not to approve the private bill on halal meat. Senior leader BK Hariprasad said, \"Purpose of the bill is to polarise voters on communal lines.\" \"BJP wishes to divert public attention from issues like corruption. \"BJP's agenda is to selectively target minorities.\" The BJP and the Bommai-led government in Karnataka has decided to table a host of issues in the winter session and are justifying their claims by asserting that they require immediate attention. Speaking about the above issues, a source in the state BJP unit, close to The Quint said,  \"If you observe carefully, all the above issues are directly or indirectly affecting Hindus residing in Karnataka.\"  \"The BJP's sole focus is to reach out to the majority community which has been neglected by the Congress for over five decades.\"  \"This doesn't mean other issues at hand will be ignored, but they wouldn't take precedence.\" However, the chief minister confirmed that the Uniform Civil Code in the state will not be introduced in this winter session. He further stated, On the contrary, the Congress has accused the Bommai government of trying to set the majoritarian tone for elections and for having undermined the rights of the minorities in the state.

Social media users have shared it with a caption in Hindi, which loosely translates to, \"Bharat Jodo Yatra was successful. Long separated couple met during the Gujarat elections. Narendra Modi with Jashodaben.\" An archive of the post can be seen here. (Source: Facebook/Screenshot) The post has gone extremely viral on social media platforms. Several social media users have shared the image on the internet. (Source: Facebook/Twitter/Screenshot) (Archives of similar claims can be found here, here, and here.) The truth: The viral image has been edited to add the picture of Jashodaben. The original picture was reportedly taken when PM Modi visited his mother's residence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, to seek her blessings before casting his vote in the 2022 Gujarat Elections. How did we find it out?: We performed a reverse image search on the viral image, which led us to a tweet posted by NDTV. It was uploaded on 4 December and carried the viral picture. On comparing, one can notice that the picture has been edited.  A comparison between both the images clearly highlights the similarities. (Source: NDTV Twitter/Screenshot/Altered by The Quint) We also found a video uploaded by ANI on 4 December, which mentioned that PM Modi visited his mother's residence in Gandhinagar to seek her blessings before casting vote at the Ranip polling booth.  The video did not show any visuals of Jashodaben.  Further, we noticed a watermark on the viral image which mentioned a social media handle \"Deep4IND\". The stamp of the social media accounts can be seen on the viral image. (Source: Viral image/Facebook/Altered by The Quint) Taking this as a cue, we searched for the handle on Instagram and came across the viral post uploaded on 4 December. The account's bio mentioned \"satire and sarcasm\", and it regularly uploads such satirical posts.  The page regularly uploads similar satirical content. (Source: Instagram/Screenshot/Altered by The Quint) Conclusion: The picture showing PM Modi sitting with his mother and estranged wife is edited.

There are plenty of phones out there with ultrawide cameras, but the best of the bunch deliver far more than just a wider field of view. In fact, an ultrawide perspective is only one part of the equation when it comes to delivering a great wide-angle experience. So, what should you be looking for if you want a phone with a great ultrawide camera? We\u2019ve got you covered with our guide to the technology. Don\u2019t miss: Photography terms explained: ISO, aperture, shutter speed, and more Today\u2019s primary rear cameras on smartphones are also known as wide cameras. They offer a field of view that\u2019s wider than traditional digital cameras. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S22 has a 50MP main camera with a field of view (FoV) of roughly 85 degrees. Meanwhile, ultrawide cameras go even wider than that, with the S22\u2019s ultrawide sensor offering a 120-degree FoV. This wider field of view allows you to cram more into your picture and is also more in line with what your eyes see. Check out the difference between the Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus main (left) and ultrawide shots below. \u00a0 One downside to ultrawide cameras is that many of them suffer from fish-eye lens distortion. Those with an extremely wide field of view (~120 degrees or higher) usually have more pronounced distortion in this regard. For example, straight lines at the edges of a photo can appear curved, while people on the periphery can look squashed or have abnormally shaped features. Nevertheless, some people like this distortion because it gives images a look akin to a GoPro. Check out an example of distortion below, with the left-hand side of the door taking on a warped appearance. This photo was taken with the 2019-era Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro, with the distortion correction toggle off. It\u2019s tough to create ultrawide lenses that avoid this distortion. The light is essentially being bent by the lens near the edges to capture as much of the scene as possible. Many manufacturers try to correct it via a software algorithm or by simply cropping the distorted edges out of the final image, commonly activated via a toggle in the camera app. Other companies like Google, Huawei, Oppo, and LG simply opt for a narrower field of view in the first place (110 degrees and lower). This way, you\u2019ve still got a sensor capable of capturing more than a typical phone camera, but distortion is reduced compared to traditional ultrawide sensors. Of course, dialing things back too far can mean you\u2019re left with an ultrawide shot that isn\u2019t all too different from the main camera. Another solution we\u2019ve seen in the last year or so is a so-called free-form lens that uses an asymmetrical design compared to more conventional camera lenses. This ultrawide camera lens can be found on the OnePlus 9 series, and the company compares them to progressive lenses used in spectacles. Now that we know what an ultrawide camera is and how field-of-view works, let\u2019s take a closer look at the ingredients you need for a great ultrawide shooter. Megapixels aren\u2019t the number one factor for determining ultrawide image quality, but they\u2019re still a significant consideration. They are particularly important if you plan to print ultrawide snaps, or if you simply want to crop into an ultrawide image. We generally see the best ultrawide cameras on the market opt for no less than 8MP for decent results. We\u2019ve also seen 5MP ultrawide sensors on older low-end phones that will do an okay job in ideal conditions. However, they often lack detail and tend to quickly fall apart in super-bright or dark scenes. A 5MP ultrawide camera also means you\u2019re going to be limited to 1080p for ultrawide video recording since 4K recording requires 8MP or higher. We\u2019ve recently seen a trend towards cramming plenty of megapixels into an ultrawide camera, with some phones reaching as much as 50MP. All those megapixels can result in tiny photo-sites, used to capture light. However, small photo-sites mean less light is being captured which theoretically means poor low-light ultrawide shots. Fortunately, OEMs often use a technique called pixel binning to churn out lower resolution yet cleaner images, especially at night. Another important factor in a good ultrawide camera experience is simple consistency in terms of color reproduction (and dynamic range) between the main camera and the ultrawide lens. Many budget phones and even some flagship models lack consistent colors between the two cameras, resulting in photos that can look overly saturated with the ultrawide shooter but washed out with the main camera. Check out the example above for color profiles that don\u2019t quite remain consistent. Related: What is dynamic range in photography? Everything you need to know The main reason for this discrepancy tends to be a difference in lenses, aperture, sensor size, and more. All of these differences affect the light-gathering capabilities and color capture of each camera. Taking a one-size-fits-all approach to image processing is therefore not ideal. It requires significant work on the part of OEMs to ensure consistency between the two cameras. Unfortunately, some brands lack the resources, time, and/or will to do the legwork. One of the features I tend to look for on ultrawide mobile cameras is autofocus. You\u2019d be surprised how many brands don\u2019t include this option. Even wide-angle pioneer LG didn\u2019t include this on its flagships, and the Pixel 6 series lacks this option too. Thankfully, it\u2019s becoming more common on flagship phones these days. The main reason you\u2019d want autofocus on your ultrawide camera is that it opens the door for macro shots with no dedicated macro camera. This way, you can take extreme close-up images without relying on a cheap 2MP macro sensor. Related: What is macro photography? Macro shots via the ultrawide camera are also of a far higher resolution than your typical macro lens, enabling you to crop in even further. The shot above was taken with the Huawei Mate 20 Pro\u2019s ultrawide lens using macro mode. It was cropped from a slightly larger image. Not too bad, right? Autofocus on an ultrawide camera also makes for a more flexible camera in general. It allows you to treat the ultrawide lens more like a normal camera, focusing on the foreground or the background as you see fit. Want to take a photo of some flowers with a mountain in the background? Or vice-versa? You can take both if you have autofocus on your wide-angle sensor, as the samples above show. Phones with fixed focus ultrawide cameras don\u2019t give you the benefit of tapping to focus anywhere. Tapping usually only adjusts the exposure. Instead, your phone can only focus on objects/subjects far away or landscapes and other backgrounds. Having autofocus can also yield better ultrawide images in general, as the camera is able to properly focus on the desired scene instead of just taking a fixed-focus shot that might end up looking soft. Smartphone cameras have made major strides in low light performance in the last few years, but this hasn\u2019t extended to the ultrawide rear camera in exactly the same way. Instead, it\u2019s still somewhat common to find a major difference in quality between main and ultrawide cameras when the sun goes down. This is largely due to the fact that primary or main smartphone cameras tend to offer wider apertures, larger sensors, bigger pixels, and/or pixel binning in order to deliver better low-light performance. We have seen improvements in this regard though, but there\u2019s still generally a quality gap. Another increasingly common tool used by OEMs today is the ever-popular night mode. The likes of Huawei, Samsung, Vivo, and others have offered night mode on the ultrawide camera for a couple of generations now. The combo of night mode and an ultrawide camera can struggle in the darkest environments, but it can definitely make a difference when the scene is just a little too dark. Check out the LG V60\u2019s night mode on the ultrawide camera above, with the standard shot on the left and the night mode snap on the right. Read next: 6 tips for improving smartphone low light photography Ultrawide cameras are capable of video recording too. The wider perspective means you aren\u2019t likely to notice judder as often as with the main camera or a telephoto lens. We\u2019ve also seen the likes of Samsung, Oppo, Xiaomi, and others offer a so-called Super Steady or Steady Cam mode, filming video via the ultrawide camera but cropping in. This serves as a form of electronic image stabilization. We\u2019ve seen Samsung and others take this mode a step further by adding optical image stabilization to the mix for even smoother video. Meanwhile, Vivo has adopted a so-called micro-gimbal camera system on the ultrawide camera of its recent flagships, combining this hardware with smart software to offer even smoother video than Super Steady modes. In fact, several Vivo flagships have a so-called Horizon Line stabilization mode that can keep the horizon level even when the phone is tilted by 45 degrees or more. We\u2019ve also seen some older phones doing interesting video-related things with ultrawide cameras. 2020\u2019s Huawei P40 Pro phones touted 16-in-one pixel-binning on their 40MP wide cameras to capture brighter video in low-light conditions. There\u2019s also the Motorola One Action and LG Wing. These phones packed an ultrawide camera that\u2019s devoted to video alone, although LG also included a second ultrawide camera for photos. But ultrawide features like this aren\u2019t common nowadays. It\u2019s also worth noting that few if any ultrawide cameras actually record in 8K right now. That\u2019s because a camera needs to be 33MP or higher to support 8K. Even phones from Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and OnePlus that do have high-resolution cameras still lack 8K recording via their ultrawide cameras. There are a variety of smartphones with great ultrawide cameras out there, generally offering consistent color profiles, autofocus, great detail, good night-time capabilities, and all the other important factors detailed above. We\u2019ve picked a few options worthy of your consideration. The Vivo X80 Pro isn\u2019t available in the US, but European, Chinese, and Indian consumers should consider this 2022 flagship if the ultrawide camera is a priority. Expect a 48MP ultrawide camera with autofocus and OIS here, which is a great setup on paper. However, it does represent a downgrade over the Vivo X70 Pro Plus, which paired the ultrawide shooter with a micro-gimbal stabilization system. Nevertheless, we thought the X80 Pro still delivered high-quality ultrawide shots in most conditions as well as relatively smooth \u201cultra-stable\u201d video recording. Our verdict: Vivo X80 Pro review Vivo\u2019s phone also serves up a 50MP main camera, 2x 12MP telephoto camera with micro-gimbal stabilization and a 5x 8MP periscope lens. Otherwise, you\u2019re also getting a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, 80W wired charging, 50W wireless charging, a 4,700mAh battery, and an IP68 rating. The OnePlus 10 Pro and OnePlus 10T have been available for a while now, but the OnePlus 9 series is better if you want a great ultrawide experience. Both the standard OnePlus 9 and Pro model use a 50MP IMX766 camera sensor for ultrawide shots, as opposed to the low-quality 50MP JN1 for the OnePlus 10 Pro and a paltry 8MP sensor for the OnePlus 10T. The OnePlus 9 series also offers autofocus and a free-form lens on its ultrawide cameras, enabling increased flexibility and reduced distortion respectively. This setup paid dividends, as our reviewers praised the wide-angle snaps from these devices. Our verdict: OnePlus 9 review | OnePlus 9 Pro review Otherwise, the OnePlus 9 Pro packs faster wireless charging, water resistance across the board, a QHD+ screen, and a telephoto lens. Meanwhile, the standard model has bog-standard wireless charging (or wired-only in India), no official IP rating on unlocked phones, an FHD+ panel, and no telephoto camera. The Google Pixel 6 range doesn\u2019t have the most impressive ultrawide camera system on the market (12MP, 114-degree field-of-view). In fact, these cameras don\u2019t even have autofocus for macro shots. But the Pixel flagships still churn out solid ultrawide shots that are consistent with the main camera Expect to find a 12MP sensor on both phones, delivering a 114-degree field-of-view. Our verdict: Google Pixel 6 review | Google Pixel 6 Pro review Otherwise, the Pixel 6 series also comes with a 50MP main camera, quite a few neat camera tricks (like Magic Eraser, Face Unblur, Long Exposure), and a 48MP 4x periscope camera for the Pro model. Needless to say, these devices are worth considering for the camera features in general. Other notable Pixel 6 series features include a semi-custom Tensor processor, IP68 rating with wireless charging, a 4,614mAh battery for the standard device, and a 5,000mAh battery for the Pro model. Oppo\u2019s Find X5 Pro can make a strong claim for having the best ultrawide camera on the market, as both the main and ultrawide shooters use the 50MP IMX766 sensor. And our own review noted consistent exposure and noise between the main and ultrawide shooters, as well as good low-light results from either sensor. Our verdict: Oppo Find X5 Pro review The ultrawide camera also packs multi-directional PDAF tech for better focusing, while also enabling macro shots. Otherwise, the biggest downside to the Find X5 Pro ultrawide camera is that the 110-degree field of view isn\u2019t much wider than the main camera. Oppo\u2019s phone also packs a 13MP 2x telephoto camera, a unique glass design, Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC, a QHD+ 120Hz OLED screen, and IP68 rating. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S22 series maintains the previous year\u2019s 12MP ultrawide camera, offering a 120-degree field-of-view and 1.4-micron pixels for decent low-light results. Sure, you\u2019re not getting the high-quality 48MP or 50MP sensors seen on rival devices, but you can still do much worse than this. Our verdict: Samsung Galaxy S22 review | Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus review | Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra review The good news is that the ultrawide camera delivers images with similar colors and contrast as the main sensor, no matter the model. However, the biggest downside is that only the S22 Ultra\u2019s ultrawide camera has autofocus capabilities, which means only it\u2019s capable of macro shots via this sensor. Samsung\u2019s 2022 phones also bring a Super Steady video recording mode as you\u2019d expect, harnessing the ultrawide camera to deliver smoother video recording. But don\u2019t expect 4K support in this mode. Do you love ultrawide cameras?

Also, check out Swami\u2019s take on the Best Graphic Drawing Tablets In India This is quite simple. You first need to insert a memory card into it and then mount the device to your car\u2019s windshield. Mounting is also very easy, whether it is an adhesive type or suction mount. The next step is to give it power. This you will do by joining the dash cam\u2019s power cord into the cigarette lighter outlet of your car. By doing this, you have done the physical installation.\u00a0 Now for the operating system, start the device and do as instructed in it. Usually, their setup is simple. In case of any doubt, you can always refer to the user manual available with your device. Please make sure that you get familiar with your dashcam\u2019s functioning before starting to use it.\u00a0 A dashcam is very simple. Usually, a dashcam is powered through the cigarette lighter outlet of your car. It starts recording the front view as soon as you start your vehicle. In some of the dashcams, you have a lens for recording the rearview also. You can consider it as a CCTV camera that protects your vehicle. The recorded video is stored in a memory card with its maximum capacity according to the device\u2019s capability. Some of the dashcams have seamless loop recording features. If your memory card gets full, it will start overwriting the old content with the new one. This makes the dashcam look like having unlimited storage space. Usually, dashcams come with a wide-angle lens to capture the full front area of the road and surroundings. Whether you are travelling in the middle lane, side lane, or any other lane, everything will be recorded by your dashcam. Most dashcams have night visions. They will operate even in a low light environment. This night vision feature is very important when you will use a rear lens of the dashcam and that too at night. There are no rules as such about dashcams in India. It can be used as a CCTV camera that is used to secure your property. However, it can be illegal in protected zones like defence areas. Also, you may have to pay a fine to traffic police if your dashcam is obstructing the front view for you. Also, check out Swami\u2019s take on the Best Electric Blankets In India There is no need to get overwhelmed with the additional features available with the dashcam if they are not useful to you. So, consider various important factors like those mentioned below before buying a dashcam.\u00a0 When you just need to record the front view, i.e. the road ahead, then you can go for the traditional dashcam. But, if you want to record that and the event inside your vehicle, then buying the traditional dash cam will not fulfil your needs. In such cases, you will need a dual dashcam. Similarly, you can see the different types of dash cams available in the market and select the one that fulfils your requirement.\u00a0 If you are a travel blogger or want to open a channel on Youtube showing all about road trips, you will need a dashcam with high video resolution. Suppose you need security for your vehicle while driving or parking, a dashcam with low video resolution will work. But be careful! Don\u2019t go for so low video quality that you can\u2019t even identify what\u2019s happening in the video. Certain dashcams are installed in the vehicles and start when the engine starts and stop when the engine stops. Then some of the dashcams operate when you drive or when there is any movement near your vehicle while it is standing stationary. So, depending upon the type of recording option, you select the one suitable for you. Some of the dashcams have a variety of controls like voice control, control when to record and when to not, control of viewing angle, remote control and so on. These are like added features that increase the cost of the dashcams. So select the one with your required control under your budget. Most dash cams come with an adhesive mount that you can easily install at the windshield of your vehicle. There are other dash cams with a suction cup type mount or a separate bracket for installation. The rearview mirror dash cams are installed on the rearview mirror. Depending on the space inside and vehicle, you can select the appropriate mounting system and then the required dashcam. A display screen is not available with the traditional or basic dashcam. If you need to monitor the road ahead and the road on back, then a display screen is needed. It will be easy for you to move back your vehicle using the view from the camera placed on the back of your vehicle. For such requirements, the quality and size of the display screen are also very important things to consider. It is advised to select the dashcam with a comparatively smaller size because you don\u2019t want to obstruct your view of the road ahead, and also, you don\u2019t want to have such distractions. Also, if you select the dashcam with a very small size, you can\u2019t even see the view of the road back, then it will be of no use when you want to move your vehicle back. A dashcam is used to record the video of the event happening either inside the vehicle or outside or both. But recording sound is optional. If you need sound also, then you will need a dashcam with a sound recorder. But again, this will increase the price of the dashcam. This is the most important technical specification of a dashcam that you need to check before buying it. It would be better if you select the one with a large field of view. This will help you capture the full width of the road despite your position that can be in the middle lane, side lane, or any other lane. A dashcam that records high-quality videos will need a large storage capacity. Usually, an external micro SD card is used in it. Having a seamless loop recording option makes the storage unlimited. But it would be better if your dashcam supports a micro SD card of large capacity. The traditional dashcam starts recording when the engine starts and stops recording when the engine goes off. If you need to monitor the vehicle while parked, then a traditional dash cam will not be suitable. You will need that model, which has either battery or supercapacitor, to record even when the engine is off. Some of the high-end dashcams have voice-controlled driver assistance, and they can even give you safety alerts. The language which they use is mostly English. It is not an important feature. You can manage without it. But if you go for it, it will surely elevate your driving experience with such technological advancements. A GPS receiver will help you in tracking your position. It is not compulsory to have a dashcam. Many dash cams don\u2019t have this feature, or you have to purchase an extra module to add this feature. If you need it, then instead of buying those dash cams, you can go for the one with a built-in GPS receiver. For monitoring the driver while sitting remotely, you will need a dashcam with Wi-Fi and mobile app integration. But if you are the only one who will drive your vehicle, then there is no need for this feature. However, a dashcam connected to some mobile applications will make it easy for you to see all the past or present videos instantly without any hassle. From the abovementioned list, you can see the wide price range at which a dashcam is available in the market, from a few thousand bucks to more than twenty thousand bucks. Some are from premium brands, and then some are quite budget-friendly. So, make sure to select the one that satisfies your requirement and is under budget.\u00a0 Also, check out Swami\u2019s take on the Best Room Heaters In India Now let\u2019s take a look at the frequently asked questions about dash cams. Usually, all the dashcams have a power cord with them that plugs into the cigarette lighter outlet in your car. You just have to plug this cord in, and you are good to go. WDR stands for wide dynamic range, and HDR stands for high dynamic range. WDR is usually part of the package in 312GW dash cams and above. It helps in combining images of different brightness levels into one optimized image, and HDR is usually included in 512GW and above dashcams. It allows the dashcam to process extreme lightning or darkness and produce a vibrant image. The light coming into the lens of the dashcam is converted into data with the help of sensors, and that data, then becomes the video. In some of the latest and costly models of dashcams, GPS is present. Some dash cams don\u2019t have built-in GPS, but you can attach a separate module for GPS function. \u00a0For basic functioning, Wi-Fi is not needed. So, in basic models, it is not present. It is just like an add on that is present in higher-end models of the dash cams. Most of the dash cams have an inbuilt microphone that records video with audio. But there are many models of the dash cams that only record videos without sound. \u00a0Either the cigarette lighter socket cable/USB cable or a hardwire kit directly into the vehicle\u2019s fuse box is used to power the dashcam. Thus, the power required is so small that it is almost impossible for a dashcam to fully drain the car\u2019s battery. This is a very common function in a dashcam. Whenever the storage capacity gets full, then it doesn\u2019t stop recording. It starts overwriting the oldest footage with the new video. This makes the storage to be almost unlimited. \u00a0Well, there are no such rules about dashcams in India. A dashcam is just like a CCTV camera that you install to protect your property. But if it obstructs your view of the road ahead, traffic police may charge you fine about this. Some of the dashcams have a continuous recording feature even while you are parked. It is mainly those types of dash cams that have a supercapacitor in them that have this ability.\u00a0 Dashcams are easily available online in India. If you want to buy it offline, you can check it in the market near to the service centre of your vehicle or ask the people from the service centre. They will give you a better idea. No, it cannot. But in some of the dashcam models, you can change the viewing angle to record the view of the speedometer present in your vehicle. Thus, you will get a record of the speed of your vehicle. With the sharp increase of vehicles on the road every year, there is a growing threat to travel safety. Hence, it is very important to have a dashcam installed in your vehicle. In my opinion, if you have a low budget then, you can go for 70mai Pro Plus Dash Cam\u00a0. Else you can go for Vantrue N2 Pro Dual Dash Cam\u00a0. Both of them have excellent ratings and sell in large numbers.  We hope you love the products we recommend!

Narindra Modi was subsequently elected as the prime minister of India, one of the country\u0092s most controversial politicians. Speaking to party members after his election as head of the Bharatiya Janata Party\u0092s (BJP) poll campaign committee on 10 June 2013, Modi vowed to defeat the ruling Congress Party, which has headed a coalition government since 2004. Modi said the party's aim should be to free India of Congress Party rule. He said, if this can happen all problems will be solved.    \r\nModi ruled the western Gujarat state. His appointment to the national campaign committee has put the regional leader within reach of the prime minister\u0092s job, if he can secure a victory for his party. But that exposed deep rifts within the BJP.  A day after Modi was elected, a top BJP leader, Lal Krishna Advani, quit several key party posts, raising fears of turmoil within the party. Although Modi is seen as a man who will revitalize the party, many top leaders fear being sidelined.  They expect him to energize the party and carry it forward and give it a new direction. The party has been flagging a bit over the past several years.  But, on the other hand, the senior leadership are a little uneasy because Modi is the kind of domineering leader who has very little time for other senior leaders. Modi would take BJP toward a personality-oriented party.     \r\nModi received praise for expediting development in his Gujarat state and turning it into an economic powerhouse. More recently, the fiery Hindu nationalist leader has tried to project the image of a no-nonsense man who can deliver good governance and rescue India\u0092s faltering economy. In 2013 polled indicated Modi\u0092s strongest supporters were India\u0092s urban, middle classes, who are looking for an alternative to the scandal-ridden Congress Party and calling for cleaner governance. But this message may not resonate in the heartland of India.  \r\nModi tried to focus on development and showcase the kind of high growth rates in Gujarat. But the BJP is consistently non-existent in many parts of India. So Modi maybe doing a great job among the social media audience across India, but the electorate is a much bigger constituency. And, these are areas where Modi does not really strike anywhere. His rule was blotted by his failure to stop deadly anti-Muslim riots that killed more than 1,000 people in 2002. This raised concerns that Modi may find it difficult to win the support of voters and regional parties in key political states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where Muslims make up a sizeable part of the population.  \r\nThe Congress party's image had been badly tarnished by a series of corruption scandals during its second term in office. It also received flak for a policy paralysis that has led India\u0092s economy to slump to its slowest in a decade. Support for the Congress party is slipping, but it remains to be seen if Modi can convert public disillusionment with the ruling party into gains for his party. \r\n\r\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] is unique among India's political parties in that neither it nor its political predecessors were ever associated with the Congress. Instead, it grew out of an alternative nationalist organization -- the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS -- National Volunteer Organisation). The BJP still is affiliated with the network of organizations popularly referred to as the RSS family.  \r\nThe RSS was founded in 1925 by Keshav Baliram Hedgewar. Until 1928 a member of the Congress with radical nationalist political leanings, Hedgewar had grown increasingly disenchanted with the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. Hedgewar was particularly critical of Gandhi's emphasis on nonviolence and civil disobedience, which he felt discouraged the forceful political action necessary to gain independence. He established the RSS as an organization that would provide training in martial arts and spiritual matters to rejuvenate the spiritual life of the Hindu community and build its unity. \r\nHedgewar and his successor, M.S. Golwalkar, scrupulously endeavored to define the RSS's identity as a cultural organization that was not directly involved in politics. However, its rapidly growing membership and the paramilitary-like uniforms and discipline of its activists made the political potential of the RSS apparent to everyone on the political scene. There was considerable sentiment within the Congress that RSS members should be permitted to join, and, in fact, on October 7, 1947, the Congress Working Committee voted to allow in RSS members. But in November 1947, the Congress passed a rule requiring RSS members to give up their affiliation before joining.  \r\nThe RSS was banned in 1948 after Nathuram Godse, a former RSS member, assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. The ban was lifted in 1949 only after the RSS drafted an organizational constitution that was acceptable to the government. Intensely loyal RSS members refused to give up their affiliation to join the Congress and, instead, channeled their political energies to the Jana Sangh (People's Union) after its founding in 1951. \r\nThe Jana Sangh grew slowly during the 1950s and 1960s, despite the efforts of RSS members, who quickly took control of the party's organization. Although the Jana Sangh succeeded in displacing the Hindu Mahasabha (a communal party established in 1914 as a counter to Muslim separatists) as the preeminent party of Hindu activists in the Indian political system, it failed to develop into a major rival to the Congress.  \r\nAccording to political scientist Bruce Graham, this failure occurred because of the Jana Sangh's inability \"to transcend the limitations of its origins,\" in particular, its identification with the Hindi-speaking, northern heartland and its Brahmanical interpretation of Hinduism rather than the more inclusive and syncretic values of popular Hinduism. However, the experience of the Jana Sangh during the 1970s, especially its increasing resort to populism and agitational tactics, provided essential ingredients for the success of the BJP in the 1980s. \r\nIn 1977 the Jana Sangh joined the Janata Party, which defeated Indira Gandhi and the Congress (I) in parliamentary elections and formed a government through the end of 1979. The rapid expansion of the RSS under Janata rule soon brought calls for all members of the RSS family to merge with Janata Party affiliates. Ultimately, intraparty tensions impelled those affiliated with the Jana Sangh to leave the Janata Party and establish a new party--the BJP. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe BJP was formed in April 1980, under the leadership of Atal Behari Vajpayee. Although the party welcomed members of the RSS, the BJP's effort to draw from the legacies of the Ja-nata Party as well as that of the Jana Sangh were suggested by its new name, its choice of a green and saffron flag similar to that of the Janata Party rather than the solid saffron flag of the old Jana Sangh, its adoption of a decentralized organizational structure along the lines of the Janata Party rather than the more centralized model of the Jana Sangh, and its inclusion in its working committee of several non-Jana Sangh individuals, including Sikandar Bakht--a Muslim. The invocation of Gandhian socialism as one of the guiding principles of the BJP rather than the doctrine of \"integral humanism\" associated with the Jana Sangh was another indication of the impact of the party members' experience in the Janata Party and \"J.P. movement.\" \r\nThe new synthesis, however, failed to achieve political success. In 1984 the BJP won only two seats in the parliamentary elections. In the wake of the 1984 elections, the BJP shifted course. Advani replaced Vajpayee as party president. Under Advani's leadership, the BJP appealed to Hindu activists by criticizing measures it construed as pandering to minorities and advocating the repeal of the special status given to the Muslim majority state of Jammu and Kashmir. Simultaneously, it cooperated more closely with other RSS affiliates, particularly the VHP. During the 1980s, the BJP-VHP combine developed into a dynamic political force through its brilliant use of religious symbolism to rouse the passions of the public. The BJP and VHP attained national prominence through their campaign to convert back to Hinduism members of the Scheduled Castes who had converted to Islam. The VHP also agitated to reclaim the Babri Masjid site and encouraged villagers throughout the country to hold religious ceremonies to consecrate bricks made out of their own clay and send them to be used in the construction of the Ramjanmabhumi Temple in Ayodhya. \r\nIn the general elections of 1991, the BJP expanded its support more than did any other party. Its number of seats in the Lok Sabha increased from eighty-five to 119, and its vote share grew from 11.4 percent to 21.0 percent. The party was particularly successful in Uttar Pradesh, where it increased its share of the vote from 7.6 percent (eight seats) in 1989 to 35.3 percent (fifty seats) in 1991, and in Gujarat, where its votes and seats climbed from 30 percent (twelve seats) to 52 percent (twenty seats). In addition, BJP support appeared to be spreading into new areas. In Karnataka, its vote rose from 2.6 percent to 28.1 percent, and in West Bengal the BJP's share of the vote expanded from 1.6 to 12.0 percent. However, the elections also revealed some of the limitations of the BJP juggernaut. Exit polls showed that while the BJP received more upper-caste support than all other parties and made inroads into the constituency of Backward Classes, it did poorly among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, constituencies that it had long attempted to cultivate. In Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, three state governments run by the BJP since 1990, the BJP lost parliamentary seats although its share of the vote increased. In Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP also won control of the state government in 1991, veteran political analyst Paul R. Brass cogently argued that the BJP had reached the limits of its social base of support. \r\nThe limits of the BJP's Hindu nationalist strategy were further revealed by its losses in the November 1993 state elections. The party lost control over the state-level governments of Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh while winning power in Gujarat and the National Capital Territory of Delhi. In the aftermath of the Hindu activists' dismantling of the Babri Masjid in December 1992, the evocative symbolism of the Ramjanmabhumi controversy had apparently lost its capacity to mobilize popular support. Nevertheless, the BJP, by giving more emphasis to anticorruption and social issues, achieved unprecedented success in South India, where it won 28 percent of the vote and came in second in elections in Karnataka in November 1994. In the spring of 1995, the BJP won state elections in Gujarat and became the junior partner of a coalition with Shiv Sena (Army of Shivaji -- Shivaji Bhonsle was a seventeenth-century Maratha guerrilla leader who kept Mughal armies at bay) in Maharashtra.  \r\n\r\nThe Hindu-nationalist BJP emerged from the May 1996 national elections as the single-largest party in the Lok Sabha but without a parliamentary majority. Under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the subsequent BJP coalition lasted only 13 days. With all political parties wishing to avoid another round of elections, a 14-party coalition led by the Janata Dal formed a government known as the United Front. \r\nIn new elections in February 1998, the BJP won the largest number of seats in Parliament--182--but fell far short of a majority. On March 20, 1998, the President approved a BJP-led coalition government with Vajpayee again serving as Prime Minister. On May 11 and 13, 1998, this government conducted a series of underground nuclear tests, spurring U.S. President Bill Clinton to impose economic sanctions on India pursuant to the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act. \r\nIn April 1999, the BJP-led coalition government fell apart, leading to fresh elections in September-October. The National Democratic Alliance--a new coalition led by the BJP--won a majority to form the government with Vajpayee a Prime Minister in October 1999. The NDA government was the first coalition in many years to serve a full 5-year term, providing much-needed political stability. \r\nHindu nationalists supportive of the BJP agitated to build a temple on a disputed site in Ayodhya, destroying a 17th century mosque there in December 1992, and sparking widespread religious riots in which thousands, mostly Muslims, were killed. In February 2002, 57 Hindu volunteers returning from Ayodhya were burnt alive when their train caught fire. Alleging that the fire was caused by Muslim attackers, anti-Muslim rioters throughout the state of Gujarat killed over 2,000 people and left 100,000 homeless. The Gujarat state government and the police were criticized for failing to stop the violence and in some cases for participating in or encouraging it. \r\nThe ruling BJP-led coalition was defeated in a five-stage election held in April and May of 2004. The Congress Party, under the leadership Sonia Gandhi, the widow of Rajiv Gandhi, formed a coalition government, known as the United Progressive Alliance (UPA).  \r\nEmerging as the nation's second largest party in the May 2009 Lok Sabha election, the Bharatiya Janata Party, led by Shri Nitinn Gadkari, held the second-largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha. Sushma Swaraj is Leader of the Opposition. The Hindu-nationalist BJP draws its political strength mainly from the \"Hindi Belt\" in the northern and western regions of India. Former Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh was expelled from the party in August 2009 after authoring a book which portrayed the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali-Jinnah, in a positive light, though he was allowed to rejoin in June 2010.  \r\nThe party held power without outside support in the states of Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh; it was part of ruling coalitions in a few other states including Bihar, Orissa and Punjab. Popularly viewed as the party of the northern upper caste and trading communities, the BJP made strong inroads into lower castes in national and state assembly elections. The party must balance the competing interests of Hindu nationalists, (who advocate construction of a temple on a disputed site in Ayodhya, and other primarily religious issues including the propagation of anti-conversion laws and violence against religious minorities), and center-right modernizers who see the BJP as a party of economic and political reform. \r\nThe ruling Congress party suffered a crushing defeat in elections 01 December 2013 in four key states, signaling a difficult road ahead for the party as it prepared for national elections in 2014. The Bharatiya Janata Party emerged the frontrunner in these states. The Congress party faced a humiliating rout in two states where it was in power, Delhi and Rajasthan. On the other hand, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party saw victory in the two states it was currently ruling - Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. In Delhi, BJP's Chief Ministerial candidate Harsh Vardhan said he will not stake claim to form a government as his party is short of a clear majority. He said, BJP will prefer to sit in the opposition than indulging in horse trading.  \r\n\r\nSince the BJP came to power in 2014, several state governments have been accused of pushing an RSS-backed ideology in a number of areas, including education. A strong RSS influence seems to be guiding education policies, from the setting up of research chairs in universities to appointments made in the education sector. In some BJP-ruled states, efforts are being made to revamp school curriculum in an attempt to recast Indian history through a Hindu perspective. The education wing of the RSS, the Bharatiya Sikshan Mandal, has long been urging the government to \"Indianize\" the education system.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEWSLETTER\n\n\n\n\nJoin the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Your Email Address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  "], "http://www.gujaratuniversity.ac.in/": [" \nAlumni\nMOU\nRanking\nCareer\nInternational Student\n\n \nLogin: FacultyStudent\n \r\n                Established in 1949 under the Gujarat University Act, the Gujarat University is largest and\r\n                oldest university of the Gujarat state.\r\n              Greetings from Gujarat University!

Few years ago, we couldn\u2019t even think of having unicorns in India. The Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister first mentioned his vision of Startup India and Stand Up India in 2016, and I want to congratulate Gujarat University on being the first to grab the opportunity and taking the responsibility to enable young Indians to start up and is on its way to becoming a model university. \u201cPrior to 2014, entrepreneurship was merely an exception rather than a rule or a norm. There has never been a more opportune moment for young Indians to succeed than now. Innovation, innovation and innovation is the mantra going forward. Innovation is going to drive our future.The government is making efforts to connect startups with its ecosystem so that government's procurement requirements can be met with innovative solutions by startups,\" Universities can go a long way in making Forensic Science popular among students. I\u2019m incredibly appreciative of the fact that Gujarat University for organising this Forensic Science Conference, and hope that this will establish the way forward to founding a Forensic Council in the time to come. I\u2019m grateful to Gujarat University for nurturing alumni like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. There is always an inevitable need for University and Industry to work together, but what Gujarat University is doing is far, far more important. The University is not just creating linkages and collaborating with businesses of today but creating tomorrow\u2019s businesses at the University itself! I really look forward to having Gujarat University\u2019s guidance on what and how we should take this idea forward nationally. It is hard to find that a single university has produced pioneering stakeholders in multiple fields and helped them reach the zenith of success. Gujarat University has single-handedly groomed the likes of the country\u2019s Prime Minister besides Chief Justices and notable scientists.\r\n \r\n It makes me happy to be in the place of birth and the original battleground of the Father of the Nation. But what makes me happier still, is being amongst the young students of this University, one of whom carved his journey to being the Prime Minister of the country, setting high standards of self-reliance and national consciousness for every student. I\u2019m happy to see that 13 out of 21 medals at today\u2019s Convocation ceremony are being won by girl students. It is noteworthy that 85 per cent of students at Gujarat University are from other states and union territories, making the University campus a mini-India and strengthening our national unity. It is nothing but a sign of an evolving nation that Prime Ministers today aren\u2019t Cambridge and Oxford graduates, but alumni of Gujarat University.

Democratic Alliance (DA),  South African political party formed in 2000 through the merger of the Democratic Party, the New National Party (see National Party), and the Federal Alliance. The Democratic Alliance became the official opposition party to the African National Congress (ANC), though the New National Party withdrew from the alliance the following year. The Democratic Alliance traces its ancestry through the Democratic Party, a political party established in 1989 by the merger of the Progressive Federal Party with two smaller liberal parties, the National Democratic Movement and the Independent Party. The Democratic Party supported full voting and other civil rights for South Africa\u2019s black majority and constitutional changes toward that end. Following the dismantling of the apartheid system, South Africa held its first election by universal suffrage in 1994, which resulted in the country\u2019s first multiethnic government. The Democratic Party won seven seats in the National Assembly, finishing far behind the ANC. In 1999, however, the Democratic Party won 38 seats and became the second largest party in the legislature. The Democratic Party subsequently proclaimed itself the party with the \u201cguts to fight back,\u201d and its leader, Tony Leon, cultivated a belligerent attitude toward the ruling ANC. In an effort to present a more effective opposition to the ANC, the Democratic Party joined with the New National Party and the Federal Alliance in 2000 to form the DA. The union between the three would prove to be short-lived, however, as the New National Party left the alliance in 2001 and tied its fortunes to the ANC while the other two parties remained united as the DA. The DA built its electoral base over subsequent years, and it had particular success in Cape Town. In March 2006 the party scored a major victory in local elections: DA spokesperson Helen Zille became mayor of Cape Town, and the DA won control of the Cape Town metropolitan council at the head of a multiparty coalition. The following year Tony Leon stepped down as party leader, and Zille succeeded him (while remaining mayor of Cape Town). In the 2009 elections the DA finished in second place with almost 17 percent of the national vote, far behind the victorious ANC. The DA performed strongly in the Western Cape, however\u2014taking almost 49 percent of the vote in that province and marking the first time since 1999 that the Western Cape was not dominated by the ANC\u2014and Zille became the premier of the province. The party placed second in Gauteng province, becoming the official opposition party there. In 2010 the DA and another opposition party, the Independent Democrats (ID), headed by Patricia de Lille, announced that the two parties would merge by the 2014 national and provincial elections, with the DA absorbing the ID. In early 2014 the DA looked poised to absorb another opposition party, the nascent Agang SA, headed by Mamphela Ramphele, but that potential merger quickly collapsed. The DA expanded its presence on both the national and provincial levels in the 2014 elections. The party finished in second place behind the ANC in the national poll again but won more than 22 percent of the vote, a higher percentage than in 2009. The DA dominated the Western Cape once more, this time with almost 60 percent of the vote, and it rose to the position of being the official opposition party in six other provinces. Zille did not stand for reelection as leader of the DA at the party\u2019s federal congress on May 9\u201310, 2015. She was succeeded by Mmusi Maimane, the DA\u2019s parliamentary spokesperson. He was the first black African to be elected leader of the DA. In the 2019 national and provincial elections, the DA\u2019s performance declined somewhat\u2014the first decline since the party\u2019s formation in 2000. The party won almost 21 percent of the vote, a slight drop from 2014. It was enough, however, to keep the party firmly in place as the official opposition party to the ANC at the national level. The DA continued its streak of dominating the Western Cape, albeit with about 55 percent of the vote, a smaller percentage than it won in 2014. The party did not perform as well in the rest of the country and continued as the official opposition party in only four other provinces."], "https://www.sentinelassam.com/north-east-india-news/tripura-news/bharatiya-janata-party-bjp-top-brass-to-assess-poll-preparedness-for-tripura-627610": [" By : Sentinel Digital DeskPublished : \u00a012 Dec 2022 8:45 AM GMT\u00a0 | Updated : \u00a02022-12-12T14:31:19+05:30 Published : \u00a012 Dec 2022 8:45 AM GMT \u00a0 | Updated : \u00a02022-12-12T14:31:19+05:30 NEW DELHI: Days after a record performance in Gujarat, the BJP has stepped up its preparations for the next round of Assembly polls with a meeting of the party's senior leaders from Tripura and the party's central leaders scheduled to take place on Sunday evening at the party headquarters in the national capital. BJP is in power in Tripura and Assembly polls are expected to be held early next year.   Union Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP president JP Nadda, party general secretary (organization) BL Santosh will be present in the meeting along with Tripura Chief Minister Manik Saha, former Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Deb, State BJP president Rajib Bhattacharjee, Union Minister Protima Bhoumik, Tripura in-charge Mahesh Sharma and senior leaders.   \"We have had a number of discussions on election preparedness in Tripura but with now only a couple of months to go (for the polls) the party wants to assess where it stands,\" a source privy to the details told ANI.   Prime Minister Narendra Modi may visit Agartala later this month where he will announce a slew of development projects and also address a rally.   The Assembly polls in Tripura are likely to be held by March, 2023.   Apart from Congress, the BJP also faces a challenge from Trinamool Congress (TMC) which is trying to expand in Tripura.

Fortunately, you can clean and polish it with the right tools and a bit of elbow grease.\n Tip: Whenever you apply polish to interior plastic, consider using a can or stream of compressed air to clean out any excess product from the pad\u2019s surface.

A piano is a keyboard musical instrument that has wire strings that sound when struck by felt-covered hammers operated from a keyboard. It is also called a pianoforte. The standard modern piano has 88 keys and has a compass of seven full octaves plus a few keys. The white keys represent the diatonic notes and the black keys are their respective sharps and flats. There have been many great pianists over time with a variety of styles. This list includes but is not limited to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Myra Hess, and Clara Schumann. One of the best-known pianists of the early 21st century is Mitsuko Uchida. Bartolomeo Cristofori is often credited with inventing the piano about 1709, though this has been disputed. Cristofori\u2019s piano was not the first instrument using keyboard striking action; examples of the piano principle existed as early as about 1440. However, the modern piano design stems from Cristofori\u2019s creation. Piano pedals are used to change the tone of the instrument. However, the use of these pedals is a very advanced technique and is therefore not strictly necessary for beginners and intermediate players who are trying to memorize key positions.  piano, also called pianoforte, French piano or pianoforte, German Klavier,  a keyboard musical instrument having wire strings that sound when struck by felt-covered hammers operated from a keyboard. The standard modern piano contains 88 keys and has a compass of seven full octaves plus a few keys. The vibration of the strings is transmitted to a soundboard by means of a bridge over which the strings are stretched; the soundboard amplifies the sound and affects its tone quality. The hammers that strike the strings are affixed to a mechanism resting on the far ends of the keys; hammer and mechanism compose the \u201caction.\u201d The function of the mechanism is to accelerate the motion of the hammer, catch it as it rebounds from the strings, and hold it in position for the next attack. Modern hammers are covered with felt; earlier, leather was used. The modern piano has a cast-iron frame capable of withstanding the tremendous tension of the strings; early pianos had wood frames and thus could only be lightly strung. Modern pianos are therefore much louder than were those of the 18th century, an increase in loudness necessitated in part by the size of 19th-century concert halls. Of the three pedals found on most pianos, the damper pedal on the right lifts all the felt dampers above the strings, allowing them all to vibrate freely; the left pedal shifts the keyboard and action sideways to enable the hammer to strike only one of the two or three unison strings of each tenor and treble key (the bass notes are only single-strung); and the middle pedal (generally available on grand pianos but also found on some upright pianos) usually holds up the dampers only of those keys depressed when the pedal is depressed. Credit for priority of invention has been much disputed, but there is little doubt that it belongs to Bartolomeo Cristofori, who devised his gravecembalo col piano e forte (\u201charpsichord with soft and loud\u201d) in Florence in approximately 1709. This was not the first instrument using keyboard striking action; examples of the piano principle existed as early as about 1440. Cristofori had arrived at all the essentials of the modern piano action by 1726, and it is from Cristofori\u2019s piano that the modern piano stems. The piano, made in a variety of forms, was widely popular in the mid-18th century. Preferring a lighter, less-expensive instrument with a softer touch, German piano makers perfected the square piano. When Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Muzio Clementi began to write for the piano, a distinctively pianistic style of playing and composing developed. From that point on, the piano became the preferred medium for salon music, chamber music, concerti, and song accompaniments. By roughly 1860 the upright piano had virtually replaced the square piano for home use. Early upright pianos were made according to the design of upright harpsichords with the strings rising from keyboard level. They were consequently very tall, and many were made in elegant shapes. But by taking the strings down to floor level, John Isaac Hawkins made the upright shorter and more suitable for small rooms. A number of developments followed in the 19th and 20th centuries. String tension, determined at 16 tons in 1862, increased to as much as 30 tons in modern instruments. The result is a dynamic range, sostenuto (ability to sustain a tone), and tonal spectrum unknown to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Ludwig van Beethoven, and even Franz Liszt. A significant development in the 20th century (beginning in the 1930s) was the appearance of the electronic, or electric, piano, which relied on electroacoustic or digital methods of tone production and was heard through an amplifier and loudspeaker.See alsobarrel piano; player piano."], "https://www.firstpost.com/india/former-president-ram-nath-kovind-77th-birthday-pm-modi-vp-dhankhar-others-extend-wishes-11368281.html": [" \n                            Former President Ram Nath Kovind.

This tunable CTE innovation flips the design paradigm on its head by enabling telescope engineers to dictate a support structure\u2019s CTE by matching materials in a specific operating temperature range, thus athermalizing the system. ALLVAR Alloys offer a new material solution for thermally stable structures. ALLVAR Alloy 30: These tailored CTE rods can reduce engineering design time, simplify optic manufacturing and alignment, and offer ultra-high stability of telescope support structures to more cost-sensitive designs and programs. When ALLVAR Alloy 30 is used in telescope support structures, it has the following effects: These struts were designed and manufactured as part of a NASA SBIR Phase II project titled \u201cUltra-Stable ALLVAR Alloy Strut Development for Space Telescopes.\u201d The CTE and stability of each strut was measured to quantify variability between struts. A stability of 2 pm/\u221aHz was achieved for the individual struts with a CTE of 0.6 ppm/\u00b0C. The manufacturing consistency was very high with a standard deviation of 0.05 ppm/\u00b0C between each strut. In\u00a0order to achieve this low CTE,\u00a0ALLVAR Alloy 30\u2019s\u00a0negative CTE\u00a0was\u00a0tuned\u00a0to\u00a0negate the positive CTE of each of the other components in\u00a0the series.\u00a0\u00a0 Learn more about these ultra-stable struts and the work being done on this application in the ALLVAR blog series.

Their traditional marriage was arranged in Vadnagar by their families when they were children. The couple married in 1968 when Narendra Modi was 18 and Jashodaben was 16. Shortly thereafter Narendra Modi ceased living with Jashodaben, traveling for three years to practice Sannyasa, going into business with his uncle, and later pursuing public office. He did not officially acknowledge this marriage until 2014 during his campaign. Jashodaben continues to identify as the wife of Narendra Modi. She completed her education and had a career as a teacher. Retired from teaching, Jashodaben lives a simple life of prayer. As the spouse of the prime minister, she is protected by a security detail, but has been unable to learn what their orders are or what rights she has in this position, despite filing suits with the government. Indian media and commentators have discussed the controversial circumstances of this marriage within the context of relations between men and women in society. Jashodaben was born in 1952. Her mother died when she was two years old. Narendra Modi and Jashodaben had an arranged marriage in the custom of the Ghanchi caste of Vadnagar. At the age of around three or four, they were engaged. Around age thirteen they had shaadi, which is the wedding or marriages in India. In 1968, Narendra and Jashodaben married. Narendra Modi was 18 years old and Jashodaben was approximately 16. They began gauna by living together briefly. Shortly after this time, Modi separated from his wife and began wandering in the Himalayas practicing Sannyasa. Jashodaben stayed at Modi's family's home for a few months. She resumed school after her marriage. Two years later her father died. She continued her studies and received her Secondary School Certificate in 1972. After three years of being out of contact with all who knew him, Modi returned home and contacted his family. He made plans to go to Ahmedabad to work at his uncle's canteen without Jashodaben. Before he left, his mother arranged for Jashodaben's parents to send her to meet Modi to sustain the gauna. After Jashodaben arrived at the house of Modi's family, Modi had an argument with his parents and left their home to meet his uncle as planned. Over the three-year period around the marriage, Jashodaben estimates that she spent about three months with her husband. After Modi left, he continued with his professional life. Jashodaben studied further to become a teacher at primary school, and from 1978\u20131990 taught in Banaskantha district. In 1991 she moved to Rajosana village and remains there. She is retired and her pension is \u20b914,000 (US$210) per month. One commentator said that her low salary would have made much of life a hardship for her. In talking about her relationship with Modi, in one interview Jashodaben said \"We have never been in touch... There has been no communication from his end to this day.\" In a later interview Jashodaben said that until 1987 she and Modi spoke \"normally\". Jashodaben lives with her brother Ashok and his wife in Unjha. She lives a simple life of prayer, waking at 5 am and praying at home before leaving for the temple. In the Indian general election, 2014, Modi contested the Vadodara seat of the Parliament of India. Under the Representation of the People Act, Modi was asked to declare any previous marriage. In his response, for the first time in public and media, Modi acknowledged that he had a wife. Previously Modi had often said that he would evade corruption in India because he did not have a wife and family. Previously Modi had not responded to official documents asking about a spouse. Somabhai Modi, Modi's brother, issued a statement saying that the arranged child marriage had been forced on Modi by his family. He said that the marriage was never consummated, and that Modi left it soon after it was solemnized. Inspired by the teachings of Vivekananda, Modi later worked for society. Before Modi officially acknowledged his marriage, a group of activists and security professionals visited Jashodaben at her home. They offered to escort her on the Char Dham pilgrimage, which was a trip which she had long wanted to take. During the trip they took her to the Rishikesh ashram of Ramdev, a yoga guru, where she stayed around the middle of April. Journalists sought Jashodaben for comment at the news of the marriage, but her family told them that she would return home in May. To contest the election, Modi's political opponents criticized his evasions of facts about his marriage on official documents. An Aam Aadmi Party member sought criminal charges against Modi for having failed to acknowledge his legal wife. In summer 2014, Congress party politician Ajay Rai filed a lawsuit to be heard by the Allahabad High Court complaining, among other things, that Modi did not give the permanent account number of Jashodaben. In 1992, Jashodaben refused to be interviewed by the newspaper Abhiyan when that publication presented a story on the marriage of her and Modi. In 2009, a reporter for OPEN found Jashodaben in her village and asked her some questions. In 2014, a reporter for The Indian Express interviewed her. In May 2014, TV9 Gujarat video interviewed her. In December 2014, a writer for Dawn News said that not many newspapers have had the courage to report the troubles which Jashodaben has experienced. Jashodaben said that she was not invited to the swearing-in ceremony of Narendra Modi, but had she been invited, she would have gone. She said that she still had emotions for Modi and was pleased that he acknowledged her as wife on his legal documents in contesting the election. She said that she plans to meet him again at the right time. In June 2014, at what has been described as \"her first public event\", Jashodaben attended the public funeral of politician Gopinath Munde. In November 2014, she made her first trip to Mumbai where she prayed for her husband at the Mahalakshmi Temple and the Siddhivinayak Temple. In February 2015, Jashodaben hosted some Christian missionaries who invited her to convert to Christianity. In June 2015, Jashodaben was scheduled to speak at a conference on politics organized by supporters of Modi. Event organizers report that the conference was shut down on day 2 of the week-long program on the direction of BJP leader Amit Shah and others. No reason was given for cancelling the conference, but people in attendance attributed Jashodaben's presence as the cause. In November 2015, Jashodaben applied for a passport in order to visit relatives and friends overseas. As she was unable to produce a marriage certificate or a joint affidavit from her husband, the application was rejected by the regional passport office as \"incomplete.\" Her brother Ashok said a legal option was being considered. From May 2014, police from the Mehsana district began providing continual police protection for Jashodaben. The security agent team following her was assigned as a response to the Special Protection Group Act, which says that the spouse of the Prime Minister of India should receive police protection. The Salaries and Allowances of Ministers' Act describes other benefits which are typically given to spouses of prime ministers. In November 2014, Jashodaben filed a Right to Information Act (RTI) request seeking details about her security and rights as the spouse of the prime minister. She reported that she was \"very scared\" of them and asked for copies of the orders they were following. Various media organizations in India reported the RTI in different ways, including emphasizing Jashodaben's fear, the financial implications of her complaint, the guards' demands to be treated as guests, or the case as an example of female independence. Jashodaben has said that her security details suggest she refrain from talking with the media. The Gulf News reported that her security guards are primarily with her to conduct surveillance on her. Jashodaben's family has complained that her guards do not keep any identity cards, refuse to identify themselves, and refuse to name the person or office supervising them. In December, the Intelligence Bureau denied her request for information about orders, saying that the law has an exemption which applies in this case. Jashodaben uses the name \"Jashodaben Narendrabahi Modi\", which is her married name. The letter was addressed to \"Jashodaben, daughter of (her father)\". At the end of December 2014, Jashodaben filed an appeal to the refusal. In addition to the appeal, Jashodaben complained that the government officers changed her name from \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\" to her maiden name \"Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi\". Doordarshan, India's public television broadcaster, presented Jashodaben on television 1 January 2015 to hear her comments on the issue. As a result of this broadcast, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting chastised staff at Doordashan and transferred the director of the broadcast from Ahmedabad to Port Blair 2500\u00a0km away. On 6 February Jashodaben's request was again denied, and again addressed to \"Jashodaben, Chimanlal Modi's daughter\". In May 2015, Jashodaben filed a third request for the information about the security detail and their orders. She also complained that she had completed the forms using her legal name, \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\", but the government office replied to her using her maiden name. In response to the filing, a government representative said, \"If they are still not satisfied by the information given by the first appellate authority, they can file the second appeal at the Gujarat Information Commission.\" In response to the RTI request, commentator on women's issues Shobhaa De called Jashodaben a \"superhero\" and \"plucky\", and said that her actions were \"bold, blunt, and to the point\". Jashodaben wears a mangala sutra necklace and sindoor in her hair, which are traditional signs that a woman is married. The elements of the marriage and long estrangement between Jashodaben and Modi has started discussions and awareness about the relationships between men and women in India, as Jashodaben is not the first wife in a traditional marriage to have been abandoned by a politician husband. Narendra Modi's sister has called Jashodaban a \"true Indian woman\". In rural India, Jashodaben is seen as the ideal Indian woman because she remains devoted to her husband after almost 50 years of separation. A commentator compared her to Yasodhar\u0101, wife of Gautama Buddha, and to Ratanawali, wife of Tulsidas, whose husbands became great religious leaders after renouncing their marriages. She has also been compared to Savitri, Sita, and Shakuntala, prominent women from Hindu tradition who embodied \"self-sacrifice and suffering (as) the characteristics of the Indian womanhood, a noble heritage that is handed down through the ages.\" Jashodaben receives a lot of fan mail. One person said that \"Crores of girls in India take inspiration from her\". Religious organizations have praised her with comparison to Suvarchala, the wife of Hanuman in Brahmacharya, who did not oppose him when he sought to renounce his marriage. A writer for Dawn News said that the marriage of Jashodaben and Modi was \"a legal and public issue, not a private one between spouses.\" He compared the issue of wife's rights in this case to those in the Shah Bano legal case. The separation of Jashodaben and Modi has been discussed in the context of a broader trend in India that politicians may have more success if they are known for not having ties to a spouse. The RSS, which gives Modi political support, values celibacy in its senior leadership. The powerful women leaders Mayawati, Jayalalitha, and Mamata Banerjee, all are respected more in India for not having a spouse, but that reflects on different ideas about women's responsibilities. Sonia Gandhi gained respect for not remarrying after the death of her husband; some observers believe that the widow would have lost respect politically had she remarried. Tarun Gogoi, Former Chief Minister of Assam and a member of the Indian National Congress in opposition to Modi's BJP, sarcastically suggested that Jashodaben be awarded the Nobel Prize. He said that \"she is a symbol of great Indian womanhood and sacrifice\". He was indirectly attacking Modi and trying to describe the circumstances of the abandoned wife as a human rights issue. MP Sakshi Maharaj said that Jashodaben's religious practices contributed to Modi's political success. Gurudas Kamat said that Modi's treatment of his estranged wife was unfair to her. One media source suggested leaving Jashodaben out of the public eye for her own well being."], "https://www.ebay.com/itm/165820917869": [" Be the first to write a review.

After three years in power, the Janata Party dissolved in 1980, with the members of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the modern-day BJP. Although initially unsuccessful\u2014winning only two seats in the 1984 general election\u2014it grew in strength on the back of the movement around Ram Janmabhoomi in Uttar Pradesh. Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections, the BJP became the largest political party in the Parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament, and its government, under its then-leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee, lasted for only 13 days.[46]\n After the 1998 general election, the BJP-led coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) under prime minister Vajpayee formed a government that lasted for a year. Following fresh elections, the NDA government\u2014again headed by Vajpayee\u2014lasted for a full term in office; this was the first non-Congress government to do so. In the 2004 general election, the NDA suffered an unexpected defeat, and for the next ten years, the BJP was the principal opposition party. However, Narendra Modi, who was then serving as the chief minister of Gujarat, led it to a landslide victory in the 2014 general election. Since that general election, Modi has led the NDA government as Indian prime minister and, as of April\u00a02022[update], the alliance governs 18 Indian states.\n The official ideology of the BJP is integral humanism, which was first formulated by Indian politician Deendayal Upadhyaya in 1965. The party advocates social conservatism and a foreign policy centred on nationalist principles. Since its assumption of power in 2014, its key-focus issues have included Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which conferred a special autonomous status to Jammu and Kashmir; the building of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh; and the implementation of the proposed Uniform Civil Code. Conversely, the 1998\u20132004 NDA government did not pursue any of these controversial issues, focusing instead on a largely liberal economic policy that prioritised globalisation and economic growth over social welfare.[47] Two of these policies have been implemented since 2014. On 5 August 2019, the newly re-elected BJP government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, and on 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court of India passed the final verdict on the case of the Ayodhya dispute that handed over the land to a trust organization to build the Ram Mandir, a major Hindu temple.[48][49][50] The V-Dem Institute described India in a report as experiencing nationwide democratic backsliding under post-2014 BJP rule.[51][52]\n The BJP's origins lie in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, popularly known as the Jana Sangh, founded by Syama Prasad Mukherjee in 1951 in response to the politics of the dominant Congress party. It was founded in collaboration with the Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and was widely regarded as the political arm of the RSS.[53] The Jana Sangh's aims included the protection of India's \"Hindu\" cultural identity, in addition to countering what it perceived to be the appeasement of Muslim people and the country of Pakistan by the Congress party and then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The RSS loaned several of its leading pracharaks, or full-time workers, to the Jana Sangh to get the new party off the ground. Prominent among these was Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was appointed General Secretary. The Jana Sangh won only three Lok Sabha seats in the first general elections in 1952. It maintained a minor presence in parliament until 1967.[54][55]\n The Jana Sangh's first major campaign, begun in early 1953, centred on a demand for the complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir into India.[56] Mukherjee was arrested in May 1953 for violating orders from the state government restraining him from entering Kashmir. He died of a heart attack the following month, while still in jail.[56] Mauli Chandra Sharma was elected to succeed Mukherjee; however, he was forced out of power by the RSS activists within the party, and the leadership went instead to Upadhyaya. Upadhyay remained the General Secretary until 1967, and worked to build a committed grassroots organisation in the image of the RSS. The party minimised engagement with the public, focusing instead on building its network of propagandists. Upadhyaya also articulated the philosophy of integral humanism, which formed the official doctrine of the party.[57] Younger leaders, such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani also became involved with the leadership in this period, with Vajpayee succeeding Upadhyaya as president in 1968. The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were legislating a uniform civil code, banning cow slaughter and abolishing the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir.[58]\n After assembly elections across the country in 1967, the party entered into a coalition with several other parties, including the Swatantra Party and the socialists. It formed governments in various states across the Hindi heartland, including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It was the first time the Jana Sangh held political office, albeit within a coalition; this caused the shelving of the Jana Sangh's more radical agenda.[59]\n In 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed a state of emergency. The Jana Sangh took part in the widespread protests, with thousands of its members being imprisoned along with other agitators across the country. In 1977, the emergency was withdrawn and general elections were held. The Jana Sangh merged with parties from across the political spectrum, including the Socialist Party, the Congress (O) and the Bharatiya Lok Dal to form the Janata Party, with its main agenda being defeating Indira Gandhi.[55]\n The Janata Party won a majority in 1977 and formed a government with Morarji Desai as Prime Minister. The former Jana Sangh contributed the largest tally to the Janata Party's parliamentary contingent, with 93 seats or 31% of its strength. Vajpayee, previously the leader of the Jana Sangh, was appointed the Minister of External Affairs.[60]\n The national leadership of the former Jana Sangh consciously renounced its identity, and attempted to integrate with the political culture of the Janata Party, based on Gandhian and Hindu traditionalist principles. According to Christophe Jaffrelot, this proved to be impossible assimilation.[61] The state and local levels of the Jana Sangh remained relatively unchanged, retaining a strong association with the RSS, which did not sit well with the moderate centre-right constituents of the Party.[62] Violence between Hindus and Muslims increased sharply during the years that the Janata Party formed the government, with former Jana Sangha members being implicated in the riots at Aligarh and Jamshedpur in 1978\u201379. The other major constituents of the Janata Party demanded that the Jana Sangh should break from the RSS, which the Jana Sangh refused to do. Eventually, a fragment of the Janata Party broke off to form the Janata Party (Secular). The Morarji Desai government was reduced to a minority in the Parliament, forcing its resignation. Following a brief period of coalition rule, general elections were held in 1980, in which the Janata Party fared poorly, winning only 31 seats. In April 1980, shortly after the elections, the National Executive Council of the Janata Party banned its members from being 'dual members' of party and the RSS. In response, the former Jana Sangh members left to create a new political party, known as the Bharatiya Janata Party. [63][60]\n Although the newly formed BJP was technically distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president.[64] Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism.[65] This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984.[65] The assassination of Indira Gandhi a few months earlier resulted in a wave of support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.[66]\n The failure of Vajpayee's moderate strategy led to a shift in the ideology of the party toward a policy of more hardline Hindu nationalism.[65][67] In 1984, Advani was appointed president of the party, and under him it became the political voice of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. In the early 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) began a campaign for the construction of a temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama at the disputed site of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya. The mosque had been constructed by the Mughal Emperor Babur in 1527. There is a dispute about whether a temple once stood there.[68] The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site is the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple had been demolished to construct the mosque.[69] The BJP threw its support behind this campaign and made it a part of their election platform. It won 86 Lok Sabha seats in 1989, a tally which made its support crucial to the National Front government of V. P. Singh.[70]\n In September 1990, Advani began a rath yatra (chariot journey) to Ayodhya in support of the Ram temple movement. According to Guha, the imagery employed by the yatra was \"religious, allusive, militant, masculine, and anti-Muslim\", and the speeches delivered by Advani during the yatra accused the government of appeasing Muslims and practising \"pseudo-secularism\" that obstructed the legitimate aspirations of Hindus.[71] Advani defended the yatra, stating that it had been free of the incident from Somnath to Ayodhya, and that the English media were to blame for the violence that followed.[72] Advani was placed under preventive detention on the orders of the then Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav. A large number of kar sevaks (religious volunteers) nonetheless converged at Ayodhya. On the orders of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, 150,000 of them were detained, yet half as many managed to reach Ayodhya and some attacked the mosque. Three days of fighting with the paramilitary forces ended with the deaths of several kar sevaks. Hindus were urged by VHP to \"take revenge\" for these deaths, resulting in riots against Muslims across Uttar Pradesh. [73] The BJP withdrew its support from the V.P. Singh government, leading to fresh general elections. It once again increased its tally, to 120 seats, and won a majority in the Uttar Pradesh assembly.[74]\n On 6 December 1992, the RSS and its affiliates organised a rally involving more than 100,000 VHP and BJP activists at the site of the mosque.[74] Under circumstances that are not entirely clear, the rally developed into a frenzied attack that ended with the demolition of the mosque.[74] Over the following weeks, waves of violence between Hindus and Muslims erupted all over the country, killing over 2,000 people.[74] The government briefly banned the VHP, and many BJP leaders, including Advani were arrested for making inflammatory speeches provoking the demolition.[75][76] Several historians have said that the demolition was the product of a conspiracy by the Sangh Parivar, and not a spontaneous act.[74]\n A 2009 report, authored by Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan, found that 68 people were responsible for the demolition, mostly leaders from the BJP.[76] Among those named were Vajpayee, Advani, and Murli Manohar Joshi. The report also criticised Kalyan Singh, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh during the demolition.[76] He was accused of posting bureaucrats and police officers who would stay silent during the demolition.[76] Anju Gupta, an Indian Police Service officer in charge of Advani's security, appeared as a prominent witness before the commission. She said that Advani and Joshi made provocative speeches that were a major factor in the mob's behaviour.[77] However, in a judgement on 30 September 2020, the Supreme Court of India acquitted all of the accused in the demolition including Advani and Joshi.[78]\n In the parliamentary elections in 1996, the BJP capitalised on the communal polarisation that followed the demolition to win 161 Lok Sabha seats, making it the largest party in parliament.[46] Vajpayee was sworn in as Prime Minister but was unable to attain a majority in the Lok Sabha, forcing the government to resign after 13 days.[46]\n In December 1991, then-BJP President Murli Manohar Joshi held another yatra, the Ekta Yatra, intended to signal that BJP supported national unity and opposed separatist movements. It began on 11 December in Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu and visited 14 states.[79] The rally's final stop to hoist the Indian flag in Jammu and Kashmir on 26 January 1992 was considered unsuccessful, with minimal local participation.[80]\n A coalition of regional parties formed the government in 1996, but this grouping was short-lived, and mid-term polls were held in 1998. The BJP contested the elections leading a coalition called the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which contained its existing allies like the Samata Party, the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Shiv Sena in addition to the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the Biju Janata Dal. Among these regional parties, the Shiv Sena was the only one that had an ideology similar to the BJP; Amartya Sen, for example, called the coalition an \"ad hoc\" grouping.[81][82] The NDA had a majority with outside support from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Vajpayee returned as Prime Minister.[83] However, the coalition ruptured in May 1999 when the leader of AIADMK, Jayalalitha, withdrew her support, and fresh elections were held again.[84]\n On 13 October 1999, the NDA, without the AIADMK, won 303 seats in parliament and thus an outright majority. The BJP had its highest ever tally of 183. Vajpayee became Prime Minister for the third time; Advani became Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister. This NDA government lasted its full term of five years. Its policy agenda included a more aggressive stance on defence and terror as well as neo-liberal economic policies.[47]\n In 2001, Bangaru Laxman, then the BJP president, was filmed accepting a bribe of \u20b9100,000 (equivalent to \u20b9340,000 or US$4,200 in 2020)[85] to recommend the purchase of hand-held thermal imagers for the Indian Army to the Defence Ministry, in a sting operation by Tehelka journalists.[86][87] The BJP was forced to make him resign and he was subsequently prosecuted. In April 2012, he was sentenced to four years in prison.[88]\n On 27 February 2002, a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was burned outside the town of Godhra, killing 59 people. The incident was seen as an attack upon Hindus, and sparked off massive anti-Muslim violence across the state of Gujarat that lasted several weeks.[89] The death toll estimated was as high as 2000, while 150,000 were displaced.[90] Rape, mutilation, and torture were also widespread.[90][91] The then-Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and several high-ranking government officials were accused of initiating and condoning the violence, as were police officers who allegedly directed the rioters and gave them lists of Muslim-owned properties.[92] In April 2009, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate and expedite the Gujarat riots cases. In 2012, Modi was cleared of complicity in the violence by the SIT. BJP MLA Maya Kodnani, who later held a cabinet portfolio in the Modi government, was convicted of having orchestrated one of the riots and sentenced to 28 years imprisonment;[93][94] she was later acquitted by the Gujarat High Court.[95] Scholars such as Paul Brass, Martha Nussbaum and Dipankar Gupta have said that there was a high level of state complicity in the incidents.[96][97][98]\n Vajpayee called for early elections in 2004, six months ahead of schedule. The NDA's campaign was based on the slogan \"India Shining\", which sought to depict it as responsible for a rapid economic transformation of the country.[99] However, the NDA unexpectedly suffered a heavy defeat, winning only 186 seats in the Lok Sabha, compared to the 222 of the Congress and its allies. Manmohan Singh succeeded Vajpayee as Prime Minister as the head of the United Progressive Alliance. The NDA's failure to reach out to rural Indians was provided as an explanation for its defeat, as was its divisive policy agenda.[99][100]\n In May 2008, the BJP won the state elections in Karnataka. This was the first time that the party won assembly elections in any South Indian state. In the 2009 general elections, its strength in the Lok Sabha was reduced to 116 seats. It lost the Karnataka assembly election in 2013.[101]\n In the 2014 Indian general election, the BJP won 282 seats, leading the NDA to a tally of 336 seats in the 543-seat Lok Sabha.[102] Narendra Modi was sworn in as the 14th Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014.[103][104]\n The vote share of the BJP was 31% of all votes cast, a low figure relative to the number of seats it won.[105] This was the first instance since 1984 of a single party achieving an outright majority in the Indian Parliament[106] and the first time that it achieved a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own strength. Support was concentrated in the Hindi-speaking belt in North-central India.[105] The magnitude of the victory was not predicted by most opinion and exit polls.[105]\n Political analysts have suggested several reasons for this victory, including the popularity of Modi, and the loss of support for the Congress due to the corruption scandals in its previous term.[107] The BJP was also able to expand its traditionally upper-caste, upper-class support base and received significant support from middle-class and Dalit people, as well as among Other Backward Classes.[108][105] Its support among Muslims remained low; only 8% of Muslim voters voted for the BJP.[108][105] The BJP was also very successful at mobilising its supporters and raising voter turnout among them.[105]\n In 2019, the BJP won the general election with a majority. Soon after coming to power, on 5 August 2019, the Modi administration revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir\u2014a region administered by India as a state and this states consists of the larger part of Kashmir which has been the subject of dispute among India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[48][49]\n Later in 2019, the Modi government introduced the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, which was passed by the Parliament of India on 11 December 2019. It amended the Citizenship Act, 1955 by providing a path to Indian citizenship for illegal immigrants of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, or Christian religion, who had fled persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before December 2014.[109][110] Muslims from those countries were not given such eligibility.[111] The act was the first time religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law.[111][a][b][c] A report by the V-Dem Institute described India as experiencing democratic backsliding during the Modi-led BJP's rule.[51][52]\n The official philosophy of the BJP is \"Integral humanism,\" a philosophy first formulated by Deendayal Upadhyaya in 1965, who described it as advocating an \"indigenous economic model that puts the human being at center stage.\"[112][113] It is committed to Hindutva, an ideology articulated by Indian independence activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. According to the party, Hindutva is cultural nationalism favouring Indian culture over westernisation, thus it extends to all Indians regardless of religion.[65] However, scholars and political analysts have called their Hindutva ideology an attempt to redefine India and recast it as a Hindu country to the exclusion of other religions, making it a Hindu nationalist party in a general sense.[74][65][114][115] The BJP has slightly moderated its stance after the NDA was formed in 1998, due to the presence of parties with a broader set of ideologies.[74][47]\n The BJP's Hindutva ideology has been reflected in many of its government policies. It supports the construction of the Ram Temple at the disputed site of the Babri Mosque.[114] This issue was its major poll plank in the 1991 general elections.[114] However, the demolition of the mosque during a BJP rally in 1992 resulted in a backlash against it, leading to a decline of the temple's prominence in its agenda.[114] The education policy of the NDA government reorganised the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and tasked it with extensively revising the textbooks used in Indian schools.[116] Various scholars have stated that this revision, especially in the case of history textbooks, was a covert attempt to \"saffronise\" Indian history.[116][117][118][119] The NDA government introduced Vedic astrology as a subject in college curricula, despite opposition from several leading scientists.[120]\n Taking a position against what it calls the \"pseudo-secularism\" of the Congress party, the BJP instead supports \"positive secularism\".[114] Vajpayee laid out the BJP's interpretation of Mahatma Gandhi's doctrine of Sarva Dharma Sama Bhava and contrasted it with what he called European secularism.[121] He had said that Indian secularism attempted to see all religions with equal respect, while European secularism was independent of religion, thus making the former more \"positive\".[122] The BJP supports a uniform civil code, which would apply a common set of personal laws to every citizen regardless of their personal religion, replacing the existing laws which vary by religious community. Historian Yogendra Malik claims this ignores the differential procedures required to protect the cultural identity of the Muslim minority.[65][114] The BJP favoured, and later enacted[123][124][125] the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which granted a greater degree of autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir in recognition of the unusual circumstances surrounding its accession to the Indian Union.[65]\n The BJP opposes illegal immigration into India from Bangladesh.[115] The party states that this migration, mostly in the states of Assam and West Bengal, threatens the security, economy and stability of the country.[115] Academics have pointed out that the BJP refers to Hindu migrants from Bangladesh as refugees, and reserves the term \"illegal\" for Muslim migrants.[115] Academic Michael Gillan perceived it as an attempt to use an emotive issue to mobilise Hindu sentiment in a region where the party has not been historically successful.[115][126] The party later became the party of government in Assam.[127]\n In 2013, the Supreme Court of India reinstated the controversial Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which, among other things, criminalises homosexuality. There was a popular outcry, although clerics, including Muslim religious leaders, stated that they supported the verdict.[128][129] BJP president Rajnath Singh said that the party supported Section 377, because it believed that homosexuality was unnatural,[130] though the party softened the stance after its victory in the 2014 general elections.[131] Senior party members including Arun Jaitley and Harsh Vardhan openly support the rights of gender and sexual minorities in India. Vanathi Srinivasan, a BJP leader from Tamil Nadu, launched the first book on LGBTQIA and Genderqueer in Tamil penned by Gopi Shankar Madurai.[132][133][134][135] However, other leading party figures, such as Subramanian Swamy, were strongly critical of the decision by the Supreme Court to strike down Section 377 in Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India.[136]\n The BJP's economic policy has changed considerably since its founding. There is a significant range of economic ideologies within the party. In the 1980s, like the Jana Sangh, it reflected the thinking of the RSS and its affiliates. It supported swadeshi (the promotion of indigenous industries and products) and a protectionist export policy. However, it supported internal economic liberalisation, and opposed the state-driven industrialisation favoured by the Congress.[137]\n During the 1996 elections, the BJP shifted its stance away from protectionism and towards globalisation; its election manifesto recommended increasing foreign investment in priority sectors, while restricting it in others. When the party was in power in 1998, it shifted its policy even further in favour of globalisation. The tenure of the NDA saw an unprecedented influx of foreign companies in India.[137] This was criticised by the left parties and the BJP's affiliates (the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch).[137] The communist parties said that the BJP was attempting to appease the World Bank and the United States government through its neoliberal policies.[137] Similarly, the RSS stated that the BJP was not being true to its swadeshi ideology.[137]\n The two NDA governments in the period 1998\u20132004 introduced significant deregulation and privatisation of government-owned enterprises. It also introduced tariff-reducing measures. These reforms built off of the initial economic liberalisation introduced by the P. V. Narasimha Rao-led Congress government in the early 1990s.[138] India's GDP growth increased substantially during the tenure of the NDA. The 2004 campaign slogan India Shining was based on the party's belief that the free market would bring prosperity to all sectors of society.[139] After its unexpected defeat, commentators said that it was punished for neglecting the needs of the poor and focusing too much on its corporate allies.[99][100][140]\n This shift in the economic policies of the BJP was also visible in state governments, especially in Gujarat, where the BJP held power for 16 years.[141] Modi's government, in power from 2002 to 2014, followed a strongly neo-liberal agenda, presented as a drive towards development.[142][143] Its policies have included extensive privatisation of infrastructure and services, as well as a significant rollback of labour and environmental regulations. While this was praised by the business community, commentators criticised it as catering to the BJP's upper-class constituency instead of the poor.[142]\n Modi has been described as taking a more economically populist approach on healthcare and agricultural policy.[144] Modi's government has also been described as taking a more protectionist turn on international trade during his second term, withdrawing from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership talks[145][146] and introducing the 2020 Atmanirbhar Bharat economic plan, which emphasises national self-sufficiency.[147][148] However, Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has rejected accusations that Atmanirbhar Bharat is a protectionist initiative, while himself criticizing India's past free trade agreements for the \"damaging impact they have had on India's manufacturing\".[149] Similarly, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu has also disputed the initiative's protectionism, instead stating that it meant \"adopting a pragmatic development strategy that would enable the country to recognise and capitalise on its inherent strengths\".[150]\n Compared to Congress, the BJP takes a more aggressive and nationalistic position on defence policy and terrorism.[151][152] The Vajpayee-led NDA government carried out nuclear weapons tests and enacted the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which later came under heavy criticism.[151][152] It also deployed troops to evict infiltrators from Kargil, and supported the United States War on Terror.[153]\n Although previous Congress governments developed the capability for a nuclear weapons test, the Vajpayee government broke with India's historical strategy of avoiding it and authorised Pokhran-II, a series of five nuclear tests in 1998.[151] The tests came soon after Pakistan tested a medium-range ballistic missile. They were seen as an attempt to display India's military prowess to the world, and a reflection of anti-Pakistan sentiment within the BJP.[151]\n The Vajpayee government ordered the Indian armed forces to expel the Pakistani soldiers occupying Kashmir territory, later known as the Kargil War.[154][155] Although the government was later criticised for the intelligence failures that did not detect Pakistani presence, it was successful in ousting them from the previously Indian-controlled territory.[154][155]\n After the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the NDA government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act.[152] The aim of the act was to improve the government's ability to deal with terrorism.[152] It initially failed to pass in the Rajya Sabha; therefore, the NDA took the extraordinary step of convening a joint session of the Parliament, where the numerical superior Lok Sabha allowed the bill to pass.[152] The act was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of terrorism.[152] However, it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon civil liberties, and the National Human Rights Commission of India stated that it had been used to target Muslims.[152] It was later repealed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2004.[156]\n The Modi government has conducted several strikes on territory controlled by neighbouring countries on counterterrorism grounds. This included a 2015 Indian counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar against the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, the 2016 Indian Line of Control strike in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and the 2019 Balakot airstrike in Pakistan.[157] It also militarily intervened in defence of Bhutan during the 2017 Doklam standoff with China.[158]\n The Modi government considers national security to be one of their key focuses and has implemented many long-standing defence reforms.[159][160] In August 2019, the Modi government established the post of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) to ensure better coordination between all three services, a reform that was widely requested after the 1999 Kargil War. [161] The Department of Military Affairs was also established and put under the CDS.[162] Retired Admiral Arun Prakash called it \u201cthe most significant development in the national security domain since Independence.\u201d[163] Modi has also pushed for the indigenization and privatization of the defence production sector, as well as promoting the export of Indian-made arms to smaller countries.[164][165]\n The historical stance of the BJP towards foreign policy, like the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, was based on an aggressive Hindu nationalism combined with economic protectionism.[166] The Bharatiya Jana Sangh was founded with the explicit aim of reversing the partition of India; as a result, its official position was that the existence of Pakistan was illegitimate.[166] This antagonism toward Pakistan remains a significant influence on the BJP's ideology.[166][167] During the Cold War, the party and its affiliates strongly opposed India's long standing policy of non-alignment, and instead advocated closeness to the United States.[166] In the post-Cold War era, the party has largely embraced the Indian foreign policy consensus of improving relations with the United States,[168] while stressing a desire for a more multipolar world order.[169]\n The Vajpayee government's foreign policy in many ways represented a radical shift from BJP orthodoxy while maintaining some aspects of it.[137][167] Its policy also represented a significant change from the Nehruvian idealism of previous governments, opting instead for realism.[170] His party criticised him for adopting a much more moderate stance with Pakistan. In 1998, he made a landmark visit to Pakistan, and inaugurated the Delhi\u2013Lahore Bus service.[166] Vajpayee signed the Lahore Declaration, which was an attempt to improve Indo-Pakistani relations that deteriorated after the 1998 nuclear tests.[166] However, the presence of Pakistani soldiers and militants in the disputed Kashmir territory was discovered a few months later, causing the 1999 Kargil War. The war ended a couple of months later, with the expulsion of the infiltrators two months later, without any shift in the Line of Control that marked the de facto border between the two countries.[166] Despite the war, Vajpayee continued to display a willingness to engage Pakistan in dialogue. This was not well received among the BJP cadre, who criticised the government for being \"weak\".[166] This faction of the BJP asserted itself at the post-Kargil Agra summit, preventing any significant deal from being reached. [166]\n The Vajpayee administration also offered political support to the U.S. War on Terror, in the hope of better addressing India's issues with terrorism and insurgency in Kashmir. This led to closer defence ties with the US, including negotiations for the sale of weapons.[153] However, the BJP strongly condemned the 2003 invasion of Iraq, stating that it \"deplores the unjustified military action resorted to by the United States, Britain and their allies against Iraq\".[171] The BJP also opposed the 2011 military intervention in Libya and urged the Lok Sabha to pass a unanimous resolution condemning it.[172]\n The Modi government initially took a pragmatic stance towards Pakistan, attempting to improve relations with Nawaz Sharif's government, culminating in Modi visiting Pakistan in 2015.[173] Relations subsequently deteriorated, particularly after Sharif was ousted in 2017.[174] The Modi government has since been described as taking a \"hardline\" approach on Pakistan, and the BJP has accused the opposition Congress of collaborating with Pakistan through its criticism of government policy.[175]\n In 2015, the Modi government was accused by the Nepalese government of imposing an undeclared blockade on Nepal.[176]\n In 2022, opposition figures Priyanka Chaturvedi and Shashi Tharoor criticised the Modi government's abstention on United Nations Security Council Resolution 2623, which condemned the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[177] However, the leadership of the Indian National Congress backed the government's stance.[178]\n The organisation of the BJP is strictly hierarchical, with the president being the highest authority in the party.[113] Until 2012, the BJP constitution mandated that any qualified member could be national or state president for a single three-year term.[113] This was amended to a maximum of two consecutive terms.[179]\n Below the president is the National Executive, which contains a variable number of senior leaders from across the country. It is the higher decision-making body of the party. Its members are several vice-presidents, general-secretaries, treasurers and secretaries, who work directly with the president.[113] An identical structure, with an executive committee led by a president, exists at the state, regional, district and local level.[113]\n In April 2015, the BJP stated that it had more than 100 million registered members, which would make it the world's largest political party by primary membership.[180][181] As of September 2022, the party does not have a single Muslim representative in the parliament and state assemblies.[182][183]\n The BJP is a cadre-based party. It has close connections with other organisations with similar ideologies, such as the RSS, ABVP, BYSS and the VHP. The cadres of these groups often supplement the BJP's. Its lower members are largely derived from the RSS and its affiliates, loosely known as the Sangh Parivar:[113]\n The party has subsidiary organisations of its own, such as:\n The Bharatiya Janata Party was officially founded in 1980, and the first general election it contested was in 1984, in which it won only two Lok Sabha seats. Following the election in 1996, the BJP became the largest party in the Lok Sabha for the first time, but the government it formed was short-lived.[46] In the elections of 1998 and 1999, it remained the largest party, and headed the ruling coalition on both occasions.[47] In the 2014 general election, it won an outright majority in parliament. From 1991 onwards, a BJP member has led the Opposition whenever the party was not in power.[184][d]\n As of September\u00a02022[update], 12 states have Chief Ministers from the BJP, and governments led by that party, sometimes including allied parties. The 12 states are Arunachal Pradesh, Assam (with Asom Gana Parishad and United People's Party Liberal), Goa, Gujarat, Haryana (with Jannayak Janta Party), Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur (with Naga People's Front, National People's Party and Lok Janshakti Party), Tripura (with Indigenous People's Front of Tripura), Uttar Pradesh (with Apna Dal (Sonelal)) and Uttarakhand.\n In 4 other states and in the Union Territory of Puducherry, it participates in the government as the junior partner in the ruling alliance with other members of the National Democratic Alliance. The states are: Maharashtra (with Balasahebanchi Shiv Sena, other small parties and independents), Meghalaya (with the National People's Party, United Democratic Party, People's Democratic Front and Hill State People's Democratic Party), Nagaland (with the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party), and Puducherry (with the All India N.R. Congress). The BJP's ally, the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha, holds power in Sikkim, but the BJP has no ministers in the government.\n The BJP has previously held power in Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Rajasthan and Jharkhand, and has been the junior coalition partner in governments in Andhra Pradesh (with the Telugu Desam Party), Jammu and Kashmir (with the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party), Odisha (with the Biju Janata Dal), Punjab (with the Shiromani Akali Dal), and Tamil Nadu (with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam). It has never held power in Kerala, Telangana, and West Bengal.\n In addition to the NDA, the BJP is also a part of a regional political alliance in Northeast India named the North-East Democratic Alliance.[196][197][198]\n As of May\u00a02022[update], 49 people from Bharatiya Janata Party have held the position of a chief minister,\n11 of whom are incumbent.\n Dharma-Dhamma unity\n"], "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:National_Democratic_Alliance_Flag.svg": [" Original file \u200e(SVG file, nominally 900 \u00d7 600 pixels, file size: 12 KB)\n Click on a date/time to view the file as it appeared at that time.\n You cannot overwrite this file.

Redmi has confirmed the launch of the Note 12 Pro in India. The Note 12 Pro will launch alongside the Pro+ 5G model in India on January 5. Xiaomi has also confirmed that the Note 12 Pro 5G will come with support for optical image stabilisation for the primary camera. The company claimed that the Note 12 Pro 5G will also be the first smartphone in its segment to offer the camera sensor stability feature. The Note 12 Pro 5G has been launched in China. It is unknown if the same device is coming to India.\u00a0 We say so because historically, the Note series in China has been different (and sometimes superior) in terms of hardware compared to the Indian/ global variants. The Note 12 Pro Chinese variant comes with support for OIS as well. Therefore, we can expect the Indian variant to share most of the specifications with the Chinese variant.  Let\u2019s take a look at the Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G India launch details, specifications, features, etc. The Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G will launch as a successor to the Note 11 Pro 4G, which was launched earlier this year in India. The device is set to debut earlier than expected. Xiaomi will launch the Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G alongside the Pro+ model on January 5.\u00a0 The Note 12 Pro will finally bring support for 5G networks in India, which was missing in its predecessor. Xiaomi also revealed that the device will support OIS without revealing the camera sensor details. It is assumed that the Indian variant will come with a 50MP Sony IMX766 main camera, which is also used in the Chinese variant. If the camera setup is the same, then the Indian variant of the Note 12 Pro 5G will also feature an 8MP ultrawide camera and a 2MP macro camera. There will be a 16MP front camera sensor as well. The Chinese variant also features a MediaTek Dimensity 1080 SoC. However, we think that the Indian variant could pack a different processor. Xiaomi might launch the phone with a Snapdragon 695 SoC to keep the price low. The device is also likely to pack a 5000mAh battery with 67W fast charging support. Also Read: Redmi Note 12 Pro Series and Note 12 Explorer Edition with Dimensity 1080 SoC, 200MP Camera Launched: Price, Specifications The phone is likely to sport a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a Full HD+ resolution. It will support a 120Hz refresh rate and could offer a peak brightness of 900 nits. The device is also likely to run Android 12-based MIUI 13 out of the box.

The alliance is mainly made up of allies of Fonseka and of the following parties\n Ruhunu Janatha Party left the alliance and joined the UPFA March 2010. Nava Sihala Urumaya was a member of the DNA until it was sacked from the alliance in November 2010. The DNA's application for registration as a separate party was rejected by the authorities in January 2011.\n The Democratic National Alliance had a poor showing at the 2010 general election, obtaining a little over 5% of the national vote and winning just 7 seats in the 225 member parliament. This is a significant decline from the 40% national vote Fonseka obtained in the 2010 presidential election when he was endorsed by many notable opposition parties which did not join the DNA at the general election, including the main opposition United National Party and the Tamil National Alliance and decrease from the 39 members the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna JVP alone had in parliament. Apart from Fonseka, the members elected were former Sri Lanka national cricket team captain and former SLFP member MP Arjuna Ranatunga, businessman Tiran Alles and four members of the JVP. Fonseka was later jailed by court martial and vacated his seat on 7 October 2010. After a legal battle to maintain his MP status he was replaced by DNA member Jayantha Ketagoda on 8 March 2011.\n \n This page was last updated at 2022-09-09 03:45 UTC. Update now.

Nanotechnology is helping to considerably improve, even revolutionize, many technology and industry sectors: information technology, homeland security, medicine, transportation, energy, food safety, and environmental science, among many others. Described below is a sampling of the rapidly growing list of benefits and applications of nanotechnology.\n\u00a0 Many benefits of nanotechnology depend on the fact that it is possible to tailor the structures of materials at extremely small scales to achieve specific properties, thus greatly extending the materials science toolkit. Using nanotechnology, materials can effectively be made stronger, lighter, more durable, more reactive, more sieve-like, or better electrical conductors, among many other traits. Many everyday commercial products are currently on the market and in daily use that rely on nanoscale materials and processes: Nanotechnology has greatly contributed to major advances in computing and electronics, leading to faster, smaller, and more portable systems that can manage and store larger and larger amounts of information.

Engineers have developed ultralight fabric solar cells that can quickly and easily turn any surface into a power source. These durable, flexible solar cells can be transported and rapidly deployed in remote locations for assistance in emergencies. To enhance the design and performance of triboelectric nanogenerators, researchers have combined a porous 2D material and laser-induced graphene foam nanocomposite to enable a triboelectric nanogenerator to perform on the human skin or the leaf of a plant. Scientists are using tungsten silicide superconducting nanowires as dark-matter detectors. An estimated 85% of the mass in the universe is missing, and it\u2019s called dark matter.

He has set his eyes on the bigger prize\u2014the 2024 General Election\u2014which he wants to win for the BJP for a third consecutive term. Soon after he made a public show of casting his vote in Ahmedabad\u2019s Nishant High School\u2014which had the Opposition crying foul, claiming that it violated the election code of conduct\u2014Modi took a flight back to the national capital. From the airport, he drove straight to the BJP\u2019s headquarters at Deendayal Upadhyay Marg to conduct a two-day review meeting with national office-bearers, the state prabharis and the state unit chiefs of preparations for nine states that will go to the polls in 2023 and to chalk out the roadmap to ensure his party\u2019s victory in 2024.

Kovind was sworn-in by Chief Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar at the Central Hall of Parliament House today. Ram Nath Kovind is the 14th President of India.   President Ram Nath Kovind, 71, is the second Dalit President, after KR Narayanan, to walk into the Rashtrapati Bhawan. But, there is something that former President Pranab Mukherjee had but Ram Nath Kovind doesn't.  Pending mercy pleas. Almost all the former Presidents of India, have a record of passing on at least a few pending mercy pleas to their successors. But President Ram Nath won't have any pending mercy pleas to consider, and this is something that hasn't happened in last three presidencies.  Why?  Former President Pranab Mukherjee, during his five years of presidency, disposed 34 mercy pleas. He rejected 30 out of 34 petitions (35, considering the case of 1993 Mumbai serial blasts accused Yakub Memon, who pleaded twice for the presidential pardon). He is the second president after R Venkatraman to reject so many pleas. Venkatraman rejected total 45 mercy pleas during his tenure.  When President Pranab Mukherjee was serving his tenure, he received 10 pending pleas, one even from KR Narayanan's term (1997-2002). Mukherjee rejected 88 per cent of the mercy petitions he received, and that included those of Ajmal Kasab and Afzal Guru. What is the procedure for taking decisions over mercy pleas? Once a convict has been awarded a death sentence by the Supreme Court, including a foreign national, he or she can submit a mercy plea to MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs), the President's Office or to the governor of the state. Under Article 72 of the Constitution of India, a President can grant pardon, commute or suspend remit a sentence of death. However, the President acts on the advice of the executive i.e the Prime Minister and his cabinet. Since, there is no particular time-frame set up for acting upon the mercy pleas, many Presidents sat on the cases not taking a decision at all during their tenures of service.   Here are the few of the Former Presidents and the number of pending pleas they left for their successors: 12th President: Pratibha Patil Tenure: 2007-2012 Petitions disposed: 39 Rejected pleas: 5 Death sentences commuted to life imprisonment: 34 Left pending pleas for the successor: 11 11th President: APJ Abdul Kalam Tenure: 2002-2007 Petitions disposed: 2 Rejected pleas: 1 Accepted pleas: 1 Left pending pleas for the successor: 25 (Nine of these passed on from KR Narayanan) 10th President: KR Narayanan Tenure: 1997-2002 Petitions disposed: 0 Left pending pleas for the successor: 9 9th President: Shankar Dayal Sharma Tenure: 1992-1997 Rejected mercy pleas: 18 8th President: R Venkatraman Tenure: 1987-1992 Rejected Pleas: 45  Accepted Pleas: 5 7th President: Zail Singh  Tenure: 1982-1987 Rejected Pleas: 30 Accepted: 2 The sixth and fifth Presidents, Sanjeeva Reddy (1977-1982) and Fakrudhin Ali Ahmed (1974-1977) and N Sanjeeva Reddy did not deal with any mercy petitions during their tenures.  4th President: VV Giri tenure: 1969-1974 Rejected pleas: 0 Accepted pleas: 3 3rd President: Zakir Hussain Tenure: 1967-1969 Accepted pleas: 22 2nd President: Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan Tenure: 1962-1967 Accepted pleas: 57 1st President: Rajendra Prasad Tenure: 1950-1962 Accepted pleas: 180 Rejected pleas:1  Add IndiaToday to Home Screen"], "https://www.vivo.com/in/products/t15g": [" My Orders \nCart\n\n Sign in/Register My Account X80 Pro X80 V25 Pro V25 Y02 Y16 \n\n X80 Pro X80 V25 Pro V25 Y02 Y16 \n\n My Orders \nCart\n\n Sign in/Register My Account \nChat with us\n \nEmail Us ( Reply in 24h )\n \n24*7\n1800-208-3388\n \n24*7\n1800-102-3388\n \n24*7 (Only for X-Series Customers)\n1800-208-4488\n Follow us \n\u00a9 2022 vivo Mobile India Pvt Ltd.

An eight-member election management committee, with the BJP\u2019s state president, Rajib Bhattacharjee as its head, has been constituted with the approval of the party's central leadership, said Sunit Sarkar, the party's state media in-charge. Law and Parliamentary Affairs minister Ratan Lal Nath has been made the convener of the committee. The panel has been given the responsibility to chalk out strategies for the polls. \u201cAs many as 30 committees have been constituted to handle the election effectively. Responsibilities have been distributed among the committees for smooth conduct of campaign and elections\u201d, he said. The chief minister will head the party's 11-member election campaign committee while senior leaders, including Deputy Chief Minister Jishnu Dev Varma, the state party president, Rajya Sabha MP Biplab Kumar Deb and Union Minister Pratima Bhoumik also found a place in the panel. A manifesto committee was also constituted with state BJP vice president Ashok Sinha as its convenor. Separate panels have been put in place for welcoming and making arrangements for providing accommodation to VIPs, arranging rallies and booth management. Earlier, senior BJP leader Mahendra Singh was appointed as the party's election in charge for the northeastern state.\u00a0 Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by The Telegraph Online staff and has been published from a syndicated feed."], "https://plasticsdecorating.com/articles/2020/choosing-the-best-options-for-difficult-appearances-metallic-and-piano-black/": [" All plastic decoration requires skill and knowledge, together with the correct choices of materials and processes. This is particularly true when the desired outcome is a metallic appearance or piano black appearance. The issue is not that the processes themselves are difficult \u2013 many are well understood \u2013 but there are many variables that determine what the right choice is for any given application. The right choice is not the same for every given appearance and application, but also will depend upon the volume, geometry and economics of any given opportunity. \u00a0 \u00a0  These appearance choices are so complex because there are many options, each with a different set of advantages and disadvantages. The correct choice depends upon the target design (geometry), appearance (color and gloss) and performance requirements. The first step, regardless of the desired part, will be to determine the target appearance and performance. This will define the constraints to limit the selection process. Each process has a range of capabilities, and when a process is pushed to the extremes of its capabilities there will be issues with manufacturability or cost. In addition to other considerations, some processes are very scalable from low to high volumes while others work best only in high volumes. Finally, do not assume all the answers are known. Even in mature processes, new capabilities have emerged that might have been assumed to be impossible at one time. It is important to be involved early enough in the design process to guide the designers to the best solution for their intended outcome. To do this, it is important to understand the capabilities and limits of all the alternatives. If the options have not been researched lately, it is worth reviewing any assumptions. Piano black is a high-gloss black currently very popular in automotive interiors, telecommunications and computers. It is often used with best effect with low-gloss black as a contrast or with various chrome details. The primary issues with piano black are that small defects are very visible, fingerprints show up on parts that are touched often, and cleaning can lead to micro scratches that damage the appearance. There also is an issue with making piano blacks match each other. Even within a given technology, there are many dyes and pigments available, and they create visibly different appearances. The most desirable piano black surfaces create the appearance of depth by using translucent or clear coatings over opaque black substrates or coatings. This makes it difficult for single instrument measurements to fully capture the appearance differences. As a result, when using piano black parts from differing technologies in the same application, or matching standards produced by a different technology, visual comparison is more reliable than color instrument measurements alone. Several options exist for producing piano black. Some of the most common are as molded plastic, reverse-printed clear plastic, two-shot plastic, various paint and clear coat combinations, and various in-mold decoration technologies. As molded plastic, piano black is the lowest cost for applications that are not frequently handled or cleaned. The best results are obtained when the tool is highly polished and dynamic temperature control is used when molding. If the tool is selectively textured, a part with both high- and low-gloss regions can be made in a single shot. The primary drawback to molded plastic is that plastic surfaces are soft, compared to the other options, and are, therefore, easier to damage in use or when cleaning. The depth of image is generally poor compared to other options. Clear plastic \u2013 with the reverse side decorated, either by painting or printing \u2013 can create a nice piano black appearance. It is most often used in combination with other processes to apply protected graphics or metallic appearances to the same part. With the increased use of displays in appliances and vehicles, this method is used to create a piano black surround, sometimes including hidden until lit graphics as well. The addition of clear, hard coating improves the durability of the display lens in high-touch applications. Molded, two-shot, clear-over-black also creates a piano black appearance. Although this is not the lowest cost option, it allows the integration of functional structure into parts designed for lighting or display applications. Like reverse-painted clear plastic, the primary issue is the scratch resistance of the plastic. A single layer of paint on plastic is the most common way to achieve a piano black surface when a durable, chemically resistant surface is needed. Various options exist, but the trend is toward using dual cure systems because they provide a better resistance to micro scratches caused by repeated cleaning. Although painting is the most common solution, process yields remain a significant issue. Cleanliness is critical, and the best painters use extra care in cleaning parts prior to painting. Also, due to the surface energy of drying paint, a fat edge effect can occur if the design and process are not carefully managed. Multilayer painting is much the same as a single layer of paint, other than it consists of a first layer of black conventionally cured paint with a clear coat applied over the first layer. The use of a two-layer system allows the application of graphics by pad printing between the layers. The translucent or clear coating also gives a superior depth of image. The clear coating is often UV cured or dual cured to provide the expected durability. In-mold labeling consists of insert molding a decorated film. The film can be formed prior to molding or in the molding process. Films have been developed with hard coatings curable after molding, improved haptic and optical properties, and that are easier to clean. This allows not only piano black surfaces, but surfaces that include other decoration and back lighting features. In general, in-mold decoration works best when the part volumes are higher or when it is necessary to make several different appearances in the same geometry. As with other methods, it is critical to understand and follow the design standards for each set of materials and process. In-mold decoration is similar to in-mold labeling in that the process takes place within the molding tool. The primary difference is that only the ink systems are transferred to the plastic part. Systems that include UV-cured hard coatings have increased the range of capabilities. The design constraints are generally tighter than with in-mold labeling, and the piano black generally has less apparent depth. Metallic surfaces can be very reflective, specular or have a more diffuse, matte finish. They also can be textured, have a brushed appearance or be tinted to add color. In addition, they also can have a wide range of functional properties. They can either shield radiated emissions or can be clear to them, both important properties for telecommunications applications. Metallic finishes can be \u201ccold\u201d to the touch, or in the case of as-molded, feel much warmer when touched. As with piano black there are many options, so it is important to understand the design limits and capabilities of each option to select the best for any given application. As-molded metallic appearances can be the lowest cost but are severely limited by part design constraints. Any knit lines orient the pigments, creating very visible lines. Still, this solution is widely used in packaging and consumer products. It is occasionally used, when the geometry permits, in automotive and appliance applications. As with piano black, the surface of as-molded plastic is softer and more sensitive to damage than the other options. Painted metallic appearances work best when the target appearance is a matte finish. Metallic paints can be single layer or multilayer systems. One popular option is a multi-layer system that creates an anodized appearance. It is possible to get a very reflective painted surface, but this involves a multi-layer paint system with a very thin metallic layer, which allows the metallic pigment to lay flat. Because of the processes and materials, it is a high-cost solution and is used mostly in specialty applications. Painting or printing the reverse side of clear plastic can be used to create a metallic appearance. This is most often used in combination with other appearances in applications. Hot stamp foils can produce many metallic appearances ranging from very reflective to matte. Traditionally this has not been considered a very durable surface, but advances in technology have dramatically increased the useful range of capabilities. Hot stamp has been developed for high-end automotive interior applications, developed the capability to hot stamp on some level of 3D surfaces and has successfully developed hot stamp materials that are capable of surviving harsh automotive exterior applications such as grilles. The main constraint is that \u2013 for the most part \u2013 fairly flat surfaces with a sharp radius at the edge are needed for the best results. In-mold labeling or in-mold decorations both are capable of incorporating metallic appearances in a wide range of appearances. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) has gained favor for having a significantly smaller waste stream than plated plastic. It involves a wide variety of processes, ranging from evaporation of materials like aluminum to sputtering of metal alloys. The amount of metal deposited is quite small, so in most applications the metal is then protected with a clear coating. The clear or tinted surface coating also serves the purpose of adjusting the color, and/or gloss to create a matte finish if required. Hidden until lit and lit chrome appearances can be produced by first applying a thicker metallic layer, removing some of the metal with laser ablation and then applying a thinner metallic layer to provide a uniform daylight appearance that can be backlit as needed. PVD coatings have been developed that do not require clear hard coatings for many applications. Electroplated plastic, also known as galvanic process, is still widely used to create metallic finishes on plastic parts. A wide range of appearances is available, from highly reflective to matte finishes with a variety of specialty colors, including a black chrome appearance. The metallic surface has a pleasant, cool feel to the touch and with two-shot technology backlit chrome details are possible. The primary weakness is separation from the plastic substrate during temperature shock or cycling if the incorrect plastic or process is used. The best way to determine the current available chemistries and appearances is to discuss the options with the major plating chemistry suppliers. REACH-compliant (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals-) solutions that involve no hexavalent chromium-free and perfluoro octane sulfonate (PFOS) are now available. Recent innovations have greatly expanded the range of appearances to include complex textures. Some companies have taken advantage of advanced lasers to create complex textures and appearances in tool steel. This technology allows both textures previously not possible as well as exact reproduction cavity to cavity. Additionally, developers have created a plating process that more uniformly deposits the metal on the plastic so the texture is replicated without washing out the appearance. Real metal \u2013 either applied or with molded-in plastic \u2013 also is an option. The differential expansion coefficients make in-mold metal difficult to execute successfully and can lead to field failures, depending upon the end-use environment. Generally, larger parts are produced with applied metal and smaller ones with insert molding. For example, complex and distinct textures can be produced on surfaces for both the automotive and appliance industries. This is just a short overview of the primary processes available to produce piano black and metallic options. When deciding to include them in products it is important to take a deeper dive into the limits and advantages of each option. Start early in working with the customer or designer to optimize the design for both durability and manufacturability. Finally, combinations of processes to achieve specific appearances and performance are not only possible but sometimes desirable. Combining technologies can both add value and reduce the long-term risks for failure in the field.

Gujarat BJP chief C R Paatil had said that Bhupendra Patel would continue as the chief minister and the swearing-in ceremony of the new government will take place on Monday at the Helipad Ground in Gandhinagar.\u00a0"], "https://www.tupaki.com/politicalnews/article/Hamid-Ansari-vs-Venkaiah-Naidu-on-insecurity-among-Muslims-remark/164192": [" \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\u0c09\u0c2a \u0c30\u0c3e\u0c37\u0c4d\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c2a\u0c24\u0c3f \u0c2a\u0c26\u0c35\u0c3f\u0c28\u0c3f \u0c35\u0c40\u0c21\u0c41\u0c24\u0c41\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28 \u0c39\u0c2e\u0c40\u0c26\u0c4d \u0c05\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c38\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c40 \u0c06 \u0c39\u0c4b\u0c26\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c4b \u0c24\u0c3e\u0c28\u0c41 \u0c07\u0c1a\u0c4d\u0c1a\u0c3f\u0c28 \u0c1a\u0c3f\u0c35\u0c30\u0c3f \u0c07\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c35\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c42\u0c32\u0c4b \u0c35\u0c3f\u0c35\u0c3e\u0c26\u0c3e\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c2a\u0c26 \u0c35\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c3e\u0c16\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c1a\u0c47\u0c36\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c41.\u00a0 \u0c26\u0c40\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4b \u0c06 \u0c35\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c3e\u0c16\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c32\u0c2a\u0c48 \u0c15\u0c4a\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c24 \u0c09\u0c2a \u0c30\u0c3e\u0c37\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c1f\u0c2a\u0c24\u0c3f \u0c35\u0c46\u0c02\u0c15\u0c2f\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c28\u0c3e\u0c2f\u0c41\u0c21\u0c41 \u0c15\u0c42\u0c21\u0c3e \u0c38\u0c4d\u0c2a\u0c02\u0c26\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c1a\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c41.\u00a0 \u0c30\u0c3e\u0c1c\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c38\u0c2d \u0c1f\u0c40\u0c35\u0c40\u0c15\u0c3f \u0c07\u0c1a\u0c4d\u0c1a\u0c3f\u0c28 \u0c13 \u0c07\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c35\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c42\u0c32\u0c4b \u0c05\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c38\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c40... \u0c2d\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c24\u0c4d \u0c32\u0c4b \u0c2e\u0c41\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c32\u0c32\u0c4b \u0c05\u0c2d\u0c26\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c24 -

However, perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), irrespective of their material type (polycrystals or nanocrystals), have not realized high luminance, high efficiency and long lifetime simultaneously, as they are influenced by intrinsic limitations related to the trade-off of properties between charge transport and confinement in each type of perovskite material5,6,7,8. Here, we report an ultra-bright, efficient and stable PeLED made of core/shell perovskite nanocrystals with a size of approximately 10\u2009nm, obtained using a simple in situ reaction of benzylphosphonic acid (BPA) additive with three-dimensional (3D) polycrystalline perovskite films, without separate synthesis processes. During the reaction, large 3D crystals are split into nanocrystals and the BPA surrounds the nanocrystals, achieving strong carrier confinement. The BPA shell passivates the undercoordinated lead atoms by forming covalent bonds, and thereby greatly reduces the trap density while maintaining good charge-transport properties for the 3D perovskites. We demonstrate simultaneously efficient, bright and stable PeLEDs that have a maximum brightness of approximately 470,000\u2009cd\u2009m\u22122, maximum external quantum efficiency of 28.9% (average\u2009=\u200925.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6% over 40 devices), maximum current efficiency of 151\u2009cd\u2009A\u22121 and half-lifetime of 520\u2009h at 1,000\u2009cd\u2009m\u22122 (estimated half-lifetime >30,000\u2009h at 100\u2009cd\u2009m\u22122). Our work sheds light on the possibility that PeLEDs can be commercialized in the future display industry.

Herein, we report the first precipitation of lead-free Mn:Cs2ZnX4 nanocrystals in glasses. Efficient green and red photoluminescence are realized from these Mn:Cs2ZnX4 nanocrystals in glasses. By adjusting the size and halide component in these nanocrystals, coordination environment of Mn2+ ions can be tuned, leading to tunable photoluminescence with improved quantum efficiency. It is illustrated that in-situ precipitation of these Mn:Cs2ZnX4 nanocrystals in glasses significantly improves their thermal-, chemical-, and photo-stabilities, making them promising for light-emitting diodes with stable chromaticity coordinates.

She is the estranged wife of Narendra\u2005Modi, the prime\u2005minister\u2005of\u2005India. The couple were married in 1968 when she was about 17 and Modi was 18.[6][7][8] A short time into the marriage, her husband abandoned her.[9][10] He did not acknowledge the marriage publicly until he was legally required to do so prior to the 2014 Indian general elections.[11][12][13] Having retired from teaching, Jashodaben is said to lead a simple life of prayer.[2]\n Jashodaben was born as Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi in 1951.[7] Her mother died when she was two years old.[7]\n Narendra Modi and Jashodaben had an arranged\u2005marriage in the custom of the caste of Vadnagar, starting with a family-arranged betrothal in their very early childhood. According to Narendra Modi's brother, the couple had undergone vivaaha, the religious ceremony of marriage when Narendra Modi was 18 and Jashodaben was about 17.[8]\n A marriage ceremony was held to begin their married life together when she was 17[7][14][1][15] and he was 18.[2] Modi abandoned Jashodaben soon after the marriage.[9][11][12][10]\n After about two years of being out of contact with all who knew him, Modi returned to Vadnagar and contacted his family. He had made plans to go to Ahmedabad to work at his uncle's canteen. At his mother's insistence, Jashodaben came to the family household to maintain their marriage, but her husband objected to the arrangement, insisting on continuing his life on his own terms and encouraging her to continue in her studies.[7][8][15]\n He told me once that \"I will be travelling across the country and will go as and where I please; what will you do following me?\" When I came to Vadnagar to live with his family, he told me \"why did you come to your in-laws' house when you are still so young, you must instead focus on pursuing your studies\". The decision to leave was my own and there was never any conflict between us. He never spoke to me about the RSS or about his political leanings. When he told me he would be moving around the country as he wished, I told him I would like to join him. However, on many occasions when I went to my in-laws' place, he would not be present and he stopped coming there. He used to spend a lot of time in RSS shakhas. So I too stopped going there after a point and I went back to my father's house. Jashodaben said that she spent a total of about three months with her husband during a three-year period before their final separation.[7]\n Jashodaben continued with her professional life, receiving a Secondary\u2005School\u2005Certificate in 1972[15][16] or 1974,[7][16] completing teacher's training in 1976[7][16] and becoming a teacher in 1978.[15][7][16] From 1978 to 1990, she taught in Banaskantha\u2005district.[15] In 1991 she moved to Rajosana village and remains there.[15] She is retired and her pension is \u20b914,000 (US$180) per month.[7] One commentator said that her low salary would have made much of life a hardship for her.[3] Talking about her relationship with Modi, in one interview Jashodaben said \"We have never been in touch... There has been no communication from his end to this day.\"[7] In a later interview Jashodaben said that until 1987, she and Modi spoke \"normally\".[17] Jashodaben lives with her brother Ashok and his wife in Unjha.[3]\n Rumours had long been circulating that Modi was actually married. In 1992, Jashodaben refused to be interviewed by the newspaper Abhiyan when that publication presented a story on the marriage of her and Modi.[18] Darshan Desai, a reporter for The\u2005Indian\u2005Express, located Jashodaben in May 2002, but she and others in her village had refused to speak to him and he was told to leave the town.[8] In 2009, it was reported that Modi's political enemies had discovered her teaching at a school and living in a one-room tenement. Modi himself did not quite deny that she was his wife, although he did not explicitly acknowledge it either.[15] Her marriage to Modi was said to be common knowledge in her village.[15] She was reportedly diligent and well liked as a teacher, especially among her students.[15] When found by a reporter, she became worried and nervous, saying only \"I will not say anything against my husband. He is very powerful. This job is all I have to survive. I am afraid of the consequences.\"[15]\n When required to fill out forms on which his spouse was requested to be identified, Modi had repeatedly been leaving the spousal information section blank or just marked with a dash\u00a0\u2013 including in state assembly elections in 2001, 2002, 2007 and 2012.[19] At political rallies he had said he was single.[18][20][14]\n In the 2014\u2005Indian\u2005general\u2005election, Modi contested the Vadodara seat in the Lok\u2005Sabha, the lower\u2005house of the Parliament\u2005of\u2005India.[1] Under the Representation\u2005of\u2005the\u2005People\u2005Act and following recent rulings stating that a complete response was mandatory, Modi was required to declare any previous marriage.[14] Following legal advice to \"come clean\" about the issue, for the first time in public and media, Modi acknowledged that he had a wife.[1]\n Sombhai Modi, Narendra Modi's brother, issued a statement saying that the arranged\u2005marriage had been forced on Modi by his family.[18] He said that the marriage was never consummated, and that Modi left it soon after it was solemnized, thus confirming that the marriage actually never took place.[18] His brother further said that Modi had been inspired by the teachings of Swami\u2005Vivekananda to work for the nation and society.[18]\n Before Modi officially acknowledged his marriage, a group of activists and security professionals visited Jashodaben at her home.[3] They offered to escort her on the Char\u2005Dham pilgrimage, which was a trip which she had long wanted to take.[3] During the trip, they took her to the ashram of Swami\u2005Ramdev in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand.[3] Journalists sought Jashodaben for comment at the news of the marriage, but her family told them that she would return home soon.[3]\n To contest the election, Modi's political opponents criticised his evasions of facts about his marriage on official documents. Nishant Varma, a citizen of Ahmedabad, sought criminal charges against Modi for having failed to acknowledge his legal wife and forge previous election documents as against prescribed rules of the Representation of the People Act. The case is subjected to revision in the Supreme\u2005Court\u2005of\u2005India. The lower court pronounced Modi as not guilty of any criminal offense under this Act.[21]\n In summer 2014, Congress party politician Ajay\u2005Rai filed a lawsuit to be heard by the Allahabad\u2005High\u2005Court complaining, among other things, that Modi did not give the permanent\u2005account\u2005number of Jashodaben.[22]\n In February 2014, a reporter for The\u2005Indian\u2005Express interviewed her.[7]\n It was reported in April 2014 that she does not speak ill of her husband, and does not tolerate when others do so.[6]\n In May 2014, TV9\u2005Gujarat interviewed her on video.[17]\n In June 2014, at what has been described as \"her first public event\", Jashodaben attended the public funeral of politician Gopinath\u2005Munde.[23]\n Jashodaben said that she was not invited to the swearing-in\u2005ceremony\u2005of\u2005Narendra\u2005Modi, but had she been invited, she would have gone.[17] \"I wish to be with him. If he calls me, I am eager to start a new life with him. But it has to be he who calls,\" she said in 2014.[13]\n In November 2014, she made her first trip to Mumbai, where she prayed for her husband at the Mahalakshmi\u2005Temple and the Siddhivinayak\u2005Temple.[24]\n In December 2014, a writer for Pakistani news agency Dawn\u2005News said that not many newspapers have had the courage to report the troubles which Jashodaben has experienced.[25]\n In February 2015, Jashodaben hosted some Christian missionaries who invited her to join their mission to help many destitute and helpless Hindus by teaching Gita and Ramayana to them.[26][failed\u2005verification] In June 2015, Jashodaben was scheduled to speak at a conference on politics organized by supporters of Modi.[27] Event organizers reported that the conference was shut down on the second day of the week-long program on the direction of the BJP leader Amit\u2005Shah and others.[27] No reason was given for cancelling the conference, but people in attendance claimed Jashodaben's presence as the cause.[27]\n In November 2015, Jashodaben applied for a passport in order to visit relatives and friends overseas. As she was unable to produce a marriage certificate or a joint affidavit from her husband, the application was rejected by the regional passport office as \"incomplete\". Her brother Ashok stated that a legal option was being considered.[28]\n \nThe separation of Jashodaben and Modi has been discussed in the context of a broader trend in India that politicians may have more success if they are known for not having ties to a spouse.[29] The RSS, which gives Modi political support, values celibacy in its senior leadership[29] but contrarian tones have been noted.[30]\n Many Congress party politicians have criticised Modi's treatment of the estrangement of his wife.[31][32][33]\n I am surrounded by five security guards all the time. Often my relatives or I have to cook for them, my sister-in-law has to make their beds. This is a bit annoying... You see, it gets really chaotic when I have to travel, because I use public transport and the guards are following me in an air-conditioned car.\n Jashodaben, to Reuters, November 2014[34]\n From May 2014, police from the Mehsana\u2005district began providing continual police protection for Jashodaben.[35] The security agent team following her was assigned as a response to the Special\u2005Protection\u2005Group Act, which says that the spouse\u2005of\u2005the\u2005Prime\u2005Minister\u2005of\u2005India should receive police protection.[36] The Salaries\u2005and\u2005Allowances\u2005of\u2005Ministers'\u2005Act describes other benefits which are typically given to spouses of prime ministers.[36]\n In November 2014, Jashodaben filed a Right\u2005to\u2005Information\u2005Act (RTI) request seeking details about her security and rights as the spouse of the prime minister.[37][38]  Various media organizations in India reported the RTI in different ways, including emphasizing Jashodaben's fear, the financial implications of her complaint, the guards' demands to be treated as guests, or the case as an example of female independence.[34] Jashodaben has said that her security guards have refused to show any identification or to say on whose orders they have been assigned to her, and have suggested she refrain from talking with the media.[4][13] The Gulf\u2005News reported that her security guards are primarily with her to conduct surveillance on her.[13] Jashodaben's family has complained that her guards do not carry any identity cards, refuse to identify themselves, and refuse to name the person or office supervising them.[4]\n In December, the Intelligence\u2005Bureau denied her request for information about orders, saying that the law has an exemption which applies in this case.[38] Jashodaben uses the name \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\", which is her married name.[4] The letter was addressed to \"Jashodaben, daughter of Chimanlal Modi\" (her father's name).[39] At the end of December 2014, Jashodaben filed an appeal to the refusal.[40] In addition to the appeal, Jashodaben complained that the government officers changed her name from \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\" to her maiden name \"Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi\".[40] Doordarshan, India's public television broadcaster, presented Jashodaben on television 1 January 2015 to hear her comments on the issue.[41][42] As a result of this broadcast, the Ministry\u2005of\u2005Information\u2005and\u2005Broadcasting chastised staff at Doordashan and transferred the director of the broadcast from Ahmedabad to Port\u2005Blair 2,500\u00a0km away.[41][42] On 6 February Jashodaben's request was again denied, and again addressed to \"Jashodaben, Chimanlal Modi's daughter\".[43]\n In May 2015, Jashodaben filed a third request for the information about the security detail and their orders.[5] She also complained that she had completed the forms using her legal name, \"Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi\", but the government office replied to her using her maiden name.[4] In response to the filing, a government representative said, \"If they are still not satisfied by the information given by the first appellate authority, they can file the second appeal at the Gujarat Information Commission.\"[4] In response to the RTI request, commentator on women's issues Shobhaa\u2005De called Jashodaben a \"superhero\" and \"plucky\", and said that her actions were \"bold, blunt, and to the point\".[44]\n"], "https://www.flipkart.com/mobiles/full-hd~resolution/pr?sid=tyy%2C4io": [" Terrific Ganesh yadav Certified Buyer Nov, 2021 Not recommended at all Flipkart Customer Certified Buyer 1day ago Good choice Kavi Lama Certified Buyer 11months ago Must buy!

They were instituted by the National Honors Act No. 5 of 1964, during the First Nigerian Republic, to honour Nigerians who have rendered service to the benefit of the nation.\nThe process began in 1964 during the era of Alhaji Tafawa Balewa with enactment of National Honour Act 5 of 1964. There was a short break during the Military era especially during Generals Yakubu Gowon, Aguiyi Ironsi, Murtala Mohammed, Ibrahim Babangida and General Sanni Abacha.There are EIGHT categories-GCFR, GCON, CFR, CON, OFR, OON, MFR and MON. GCFR is meant for past Heads of State. Only Chief Obafemi Awolowo has received GCFR without becoming Head of State. President Shehu Shagari gave him that award for his outstanding service to Nigeria before and after independence. The picture of Chief Awolowo receiving the award and beaming with smiles in 1982 at the National Theatre, Iganmu, Lagos-a national asset now to be sold-is still in my memory. Only three persons have rejected the National Honours. The GCFR and GCON are customarily respectively bestowed on former occupants of the office of President of Nigeria and Vice President of Nigeria including former military heads of state of Nigeria and Chiefs of General Staff. The GCON is also customarily bestowed on the Chief Justice of Nigeria and the President of the Nigerian Senate during their first year in office, while the CON is customarily bestowed on Justices of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. The order has four grades: Order of the Federal Republic\nGrand Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic (GCFR)\nCommander of the Order of the Federal Republic (CFR)\nOfficer of the Order of the Federal Republic (OFR)\nMember of the Order of the Federal Republic (MFR) Order of the Niger\nGrand Commander of the Order of the Niger (GCON)\nCommander of the Order of the Niger (CON)\nOfficer of the Order of the Niger (OON)\nMember of the Order of the Niger (MON)  List Of Nigerian National Honours And Their Full Meanings added by Media Nigeria on October 24, 2018View all posts by Media Nigeria \u2192 Your email address will not be published.

The couple was married in 1968 when she was about 17 and Modi was 18.[6][7][8] A short time into the marriage, her husband abandoned her.[9][10] He did not acknowledge the marriage publicly until he was legally required to do so before the 2014 Indian general elections.[11][12][13] Having retired from teaching, Joshodaben leads a simple life of prayer.[2]\n Jashodaben was born as Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi in 1952.[7] Her mother died when Modi was two years old.[7]\n Narendra Modi and Jashodaben had an arranged marriage in the custom of the caste of Vadnagar, starting with a family-arranged betrothal in their very early childhood. According to Narendra Modi's brother, the couple had underwent vivaaha, the religious ceremony of marriage when Narendra Modi was 18 and Jashodaben was about 17.[8]\n A marriage ceremony was held to begin their married life together when she was 17[7][14][1][15] and he was 18.[2] Modi abandoned Jashodaben soon after the marriage.[9][11][12][10]\n After about two years of being out of contact with all who knew him, Modi returned to Vadnagar and contacted his family. He had made plans to go to Ahmedabad to work at his uncle's canteen. At his mother's insistence, Jashodaben came to the family household to maintain their marriage, but her husband objected to the arrangement, insisting on continuing his life on his own terms and encouraging her to continue in her studies.[7][8][15]\n He told me once that \"I will be travelling across the country and will go as and where I please; what will you do following me?\" When I came to Vadnagar to live with his family, he told me \"why did you come to your in-laws' house when you are still so young, you must instead focus on pursuing your studies\". The decision to leave was my own and there was never any conflict between us. He never spoke to me about the RSS or about his political leanings. When he told me he would be moving around the country as he wished, I told him I would like to join him. However, on many occasions when I went to my in-laws' place, he would not be present and he stopped coming there. He used to spend a lot of time in RSS shakhas. So I too stopped going there after a point and I went back to my father's house. Jashodaben said that she spent a total of about three months with her husband during a three-year period before their final separation.[7]\n Jashodaben continued with her professional life, receiving a Secondary School Certificate in 1972[15][16] or 1974,[7][16] completing teacher's training in 1976[7][16] and becoming a teacher in 1978.[15][7][16] From 1978 to 1990, she taught in Banaskantha district.[15] In 1991 she moved to Rajosana village and remains there.[15] She is retired and her pension is \u20b914,000 (US$200) per month.[7] One commentator said that her low salary would have made much of life a hardship for her.[3] Talking about her relationship with Modi, in one interview Jashodaben said \"We have never been in touch... There has been no communication from his end to this day.\"[7] In a later interview Jashodaben said that until 1987, she and Modi spoke \"normally\".[17] Jashodaben lives with her brother Ashok and his wife in Unjha.[3]\n Rumours had long been circulating that Modi was actually married. In 1992, Jashodaben refused to be interviewed by the newspaper Abhiyan when that publication presented a story on the marriage of her and Modi.[18] Darshan Desai, a reporter for The Indian Express, located Jashodaben in May 2002, but she and others in her village had refused to speak to him and he was told to leave the town.[8] In 2009, it was reported that Modi's political enemies had discovered her teaching at a school and living in a one-room tenement. Modi himself did not quite deny that she was his wife, although he did not explicitly acknowledge it either.[15] Her marriage to Modi was said to be common knowledge in her mostly Muslim village.[15] She was reportedly diligent and well liked as a teacher, especially among her Muslim students.[15] When found by a reporter, she became worried and nervous, saying only \"I will not say anything against my husband. He is very powerful. This job is all I have to survive. I am afraid of the consequences.\"[15]\n When required to fill out forms on which his spouse was requested to be identified, Modi had repeatedly been leaving the spousal information section blank or just marked with a dash\u00a0\u2013 including in state assembly elections in 2001, 2002, 2007 and 2012.[19] At political rallies he had said he was single.[18][20][14]\n In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi contested the Vadodara seat in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India.[1] Under the Representation of the People Act and following recent rulings stating that a complete response was mandatory, Modi was required to declare any previous marriage.[14] Following legal advice to \"come clean\" about the issue, for the first time in public and media, Modi acknowledged that he had a wife.[1]\n Sombhai Modi, Narendra Modi's brother, issued a statement saying that the arranged marriage had been forced on Modi by his family.[18] He said that the marriage was never consummated, and that Modi left it soon after it was solemnized, thus confirming that the marriage actually never took place.[18] His brother further said that Modi had been inspired by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda to later for society.[18]\n Before Modi officially acknowledged his marriage, a group of activists and security professionals visited Jashodaben at her home.[3] They offered to escort her on the Char Dham pilgrimage, which was a trip which she had long wanted to take.[3] During the trip, they took her to the ashram of Swami Ramdev in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand.[3] Journalists sought Jashodaben for comment at the news of the marriage, but her family told them that she would return home soon.[3]\n To contest the election, Modi's political opponents criticised his evasions of facts about his marriage on official documents. Nishant Varma, a citizen of Ahmedabad, sought criminal charges against Modi for having failed to acknowledge his legal wife and forge previous election documents as against prescribed rules of the Representation of the People Act. The case is subjected to revision in the Supreme Court of India. The lower court pronounced Modi as not guilty of any criminal offense under this Act.[21]\n In summer 2014, Congress party politician Ajay Rai filed a lawsuit to be heard by the Allahabad High Court complaining, among other things, that Modi did not give the permanent account number of Jashodaben.[22]\n In February 2014, a reporter for The Indian Express interviewed her.[7]\n It was reported in April 2014 that she does not speak ill of her husband, and does not tolerate when others do so.[6]\n In May 2014, TV9 Gujarat interviewed her on video.[17]\n In June 2014, at what has been described as \"her first public event\", Jashodaben attended the public funeral of politician Gopinath Munde.[23]\n Jashodaben said that she was not invited to the swearing-in ceremony of Narendra Modi, but had she been invited, she would have gone.[17] \"I wish to be with him. If he calls me, I am eager to start a new life with him. But it has to be he who calls,\" she said in 2014.[13]\n In November 2014, she made her first trip to Mumbai, where she prayed for her husband at the Mahalakshmi Temple and the Siddhivinayak Temple.[24]\n In December 2014, a writer for Pakistani news agency Dawn News said that not many newspapers have had the courage to report the troubles which Jashodaben has experienced.[25]\n In February 2015, Jashodaben hosted some Christian missionaries who invited her to join their mission to help many destitute and helpless Hindus by teaching Gita and Ramayana to them.[26][failed verification] In June 2015, Jashodaben was scheduled to speak at a conference on politics organized by supporters of Modi.[27] Event organizers reported that the conference was shut down on the second day of the week-long program on the direction of the BJP leader Amit Shah and others.[27] No reason was given for cancelling the conference, but people in attendance claimed Jashodaben's presence as the cause.[27]\n In November 2015, Jashodaben applied for a passport in order to visit relatives and friends overseas.

Later, three amendments were made to the Constitution that revoked the orders, by the NDA government headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee.[21]\n He was elected and became a Rajya Sabha MP from the state of Uttar Pradesh in April 1994. He served a total of twelve years, two consecutive terms, until March 2006. As a member of parliament, he served on the Parliamentary Committee for Welfare of Scheduled Castes/Tribes, Home Affairs, Petroleum and Natural Gas, Social Justice and Empowerment, Law and Justice.[citation needed] He also served as the chairman of the Rajya Sabha House Committee.

R. Narayanan, and also is the first BJP candidate with RSS background to be elected to the post.[30] The tally of votes (367,314) polled by Meira Kumar is only the second-highest for a losing candidate, that of Neelam Sanjiva Reddy in the 1969 presidential elections being the highest ever; he received 405,427 votes as against 420,077 by V. V. Giri, the winner. Kovind took the oath as the 14th president of India on 25 July 2017.[31]\n Kovind made trips to 19 countries, each for state visit.\n Kovind married Savita on 30 May 1974. They have a son, Prashant Kumar, and a daughter, Swati who is an air hostess for Air India.[16][64]\n In 2010, he was reported to have said that \"Islam and Christianity are alien to the nation\" as spokesperson of the BJP.[65][66] As reported by IANS and published by Hindustan Times, he made this comment in response to the Ranganath Misra Commission which recommended 15 percent reservation for religious and linguistic minorities in government jobs.[67] Although more recently, the issue was raised in the media if whether or not he was misquoted and that he in fact said \"Islam and Christianity are alien to the notion (of caste)\" as opposed to what was reported as 'nation'.[68][69]\n Template:Heads of state of republics\nTemplate:List of Current Heads of State of G20\nTemplate:Governor of Bihar\n Please select an option below if you are donating from India\n\u20b9150\n\u20b9500\n\u20b91,000\n\u20b92,000\n\u20b95,000\n\u20b910,000\nOther\n\n \n10.5%\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n transparency: \u20b95250 raised out of \u20b950,000 (14 supporter)\nlast donation recorded 3\u00a0months ago\n"], "https://www.vishay.com/en/resistors-fixed/ultra-stable/": [" CONNECT WITH US Copyright \u00a92022 Vishay Intertechnology, Inc."], "https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/best-dual-sim-dual-volte-phones/": [" Many consumers use Reliance Jio SIM card as a secondary number. Since the Jio SIM works only on 4G VoLTE networks, it naturally becomes inactive if you use any other SIM card in your phone as the \u2018preferred network\u2019 for data. This is a problem because, with the burgeoning competition, all Telecom Service Providers are dolling out lucrative data offers, and to have more 4G data never hurt anybody.

It must be noted that there are several dual VoLTE phones that support 4G VoLTE on both SIM slots but only on one at a time. Dual SIM dual VoLTE (DSDV) phones can keep two 4G or 4G VoLTE SIM cards active in your phone (in Standby configuration, not Active) simultaneously. We have fast transitioned into the Dual SIM Dual VoLTE world, and all chipsets from recognized brands launched in the last year have Dual SIM Dual VoLTE support. Consequently, almost all relevant phones available for purchase are expected to have dual SIM Dual VoLTE support. For now, this is a complete list that should help: Also Check: 7 Best Phones with Under-display Fingerprint Sensor Back in 2018, only selected phones used to support Dual SIM Dual VoLTE feature but now in 2020, almost all the phones launched in India comes with Dual SIM Dual VoLTE support.  It must be noted that previously launched low-end models like Zenfone Lite L1 and Zenfone Max M1 do not have dual SIM dual VoLTE support. OnePlus started adding dual SIM dual VoLTE support to its phones with OnePlus 6. So, OnePlus 5T and a few older OnePlus phones support 4G on both slots but not dual SIM dual VoLTE.  Samsung too has listened to the demands of its premium smartphone buyers and has added\u00a0the dual SIM dual VoLTE feature to its flagships \u2013 the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus via an OTA update.\u00a0 Nokia first added dual VoLTE support to the 7 Plus via OTA update. All other phones launched since have dual VoLTE support.  Oppo F7 that\u2019s powered by Helio P60 was among the first few phones in India to include\u00a0 Dual SIM dual VoLTE support.  Moving forward, we expect Dual VoLTE to be supported on all upcoming Oppo phones in India. Huawei has always been prompt with Dual VoLTE on its phones. Phones with Kirin 980, Kirin 970 and Kirin 710 chipsets launched in India and abroad support Dual 4G VoLTE. Phones with the last generation Kirin 659 don\u2019t have dual SIM dual VoLTE support though.  All Realme phones in India launched so far have Dual SIM Dual VoLTE support.

Let\u2019s add a few more Dual 4G VoLTE supported phones in India: Moving forward, manufacturers aren\u2019t likely to miss Dual SIM dual VoLTE (DSDV) on their phones, unless they are using last years\u2019 chipsets. All major carriers in India will have 4G VoLTE services up and running by next year and more and more people will need to use LTE data on both SIMs. We will keep adding more phones to list as they surface. List of best Dual SIM Dual VoLTE phones in India in 2020 Hi there, Thanks for this useful post. It is really painful to switch the data each time to receive calls or OTP sms from jio if we use redmi note 5 phone. I updated MIUI 11 but there is no luck. It looks like chipset is not compatible for dual sim dual volte. Your post really educate the readers. I appreciate your effort to compile all this list. Please keep up good work. Regards,\nMohamed. How about Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 and Realme 5i  ? hii deepak \u2026Nice post ! I love its your site after reading ! thanks for sharing. Please enlighten me about the concept of DSDV. I see that some mobiles are listed as Dual Volte in 91 mobiles and some others are listed as just Dual SIM and Volte option is checked under specs. For example, Realme 5 Pro is not listed when I filter results with the Dual Volte option checked. But you have mentioned in the comments column that it supports Dual Volte. One more question I have is \u2018Does this Dual Volte feature is related to the processor or the mobile phone manufacturer? I read on the Qualcomm website that Snapdragon 712 supports Dual Volte. Does it mean by default that all phones that have Snapdragon 712 support Dual Volte? I have an Airtel SIM and Jio SIM. I need both SIMs to be active with a full signal when I keep the data preference on Airtel SIM. Please clarify how to ensure this to avoid surprises after mobile purchases. Hi\nChipset support is important. Manufacturers are not ignoring DSDV anymore, most (perhaps all) phones launched in 2019 support DSDV. Realme 5 Pro does. Both SIM cards will be active on DSDV phones, you need not worry. Thank you for the good writeup. It if truth\nbe told was once a amusement account it.

It\u2019s happy to know that the latest mobiles support dual 4g volte in both sim slots.But are they dual active also.Dual active means not only in standby mode but also during calls or using data or while talking on one sim and getting a call from the other sim simultaneously.Are both the Sims network active while using. what about Samsung j7 pro in future supporting both sim slots LTE No it doesn\u2019t You may also add poco f1 to the list. Hi Deepak, does poco f1 support Dual VoLte? I also want to know, if Oppo F5 also support dual VoLte? Yes, Poco F1 supports Dual VoLTE.

Is there any phone currently in market which support DSDV both active at all time, ie although i get call on VOLTE SIM1 i must  get call waiting of  second VOLTE No of SIM2. i am aware about DSDV concept & currently using ASUS zenphone max pro M1 To do so, just forward calls of one SIM on another (for both; SIM cards SIM 1 to SIM 2 and vice versa). Whenever someone calls you on SIM 1 and you are busy using SIM 2, you will get call waiting prompt. This will work for both SIM cards. Does Nokia 6.1 also supports DSDV?

No. Yeah, that could\u2019ve been clarified in the article itself but for \u201csome reason\u201d, haven\u2019t been: What Mr Deepak said. It\u2019s still dual-SIM dual-standby as the uszhe, the only difference is that receivers of both slots can function with 4G. The one which already can, were stopped getting manufactured after 2014 (latest of which supported 4G+3G at best; per him) due to the shared-interest of \u201cFirst World\u201d telcos and smartphone brands to sell as much devices as they can. Hey there, Mr Deepak \u2014 we couldn\u2019t thank you enough for this article (which was obviously found through \u201cGoogling\u201d) as it helped a lot. Particularly our breadwinner, my father who strives to have everything Better (if not \u201cBest\u201d) for himself and was hugely upset by the corporate-greed that prevented the \u201cDual SIM Dual Active\u201d phones to be introduced anywhere after 2014 (the most-advanced ones were 4G+3G, one of which I owned myself). Since he uses 2 LTE\u00ae connections and ever since his desire to have a phone which could support a choiceless VoLTE\u2122 operator\u2019s signal (let alone other disadvantages such as comparably-narrowed signal footprint), both of the connections from different operators have upgraded to VoLTE\u2122 here. But since I\u2019m a techie and thus he\u2019s \u201cforced\u201d to rely on me (\ud83d\ude09), I find this article significantly disappointing. Here\u2019s why [and indicative-suggestions from improvement]: A) The article is a \u201cBest/Top 9\u201d listicle rather doing the job of that crucial aspect (i.e. simultaneous reception to 2 distinct LTE\u00ae signals) by listing every single cellular-gizmo which supports \u201cdual SIM dual VoLTE\u201d given it\u2019s a mostly recent phenomenon where device-manufacturers have FINALLY started bending over their greed to listen to consumer\u2019s demands. Had this been a widespread phenomenon, I could\u2019ve understood the absurdity/difficulty to maintain such a list but given it\u2019s only a start. But your apt SEO skills only shows this page which is relevant for the keyword \u201cdual SIM dual active 4G\u201d and the likes among the topmost results. It\u2019s not unfair to expect something better. Disagree?\nB) As already indicated, the commercial term \u201cdual SIM dual active\u201d is popular enough among techies to qualify for a proper definition yet you fell for a latest, recently-coined term without even bothering to make a distinction. Then why mention it at all? Is that too-much to ask for?\n\nAwaiting your sincere reply and intimation of ground-action on the same \u00e0 la non-corporate. Thanks for your feedback Maaz. The title has to be something most people will look up. At the time of writing we can\u2019t be sure how popular the article will be. Secondly, most of these (or all) are still Dual SIM Dual Standby phones. They don\u2019t make Dual SIM Dual active phones any more. Both SIM slots support 4G at a time. But when you are attending call on 1 SIM the other gets inactive. In Standby both are active.\nI hope that answers your questions. If not, please leave a follow-up comment and I will get back to you as soon as I can In Standby both are active. Errmmm\u2026 I assume this is an ironical-speech?? \ud83d\ude09 If so, I understand you were talking\u2019bout \u201cDual SIM Dual Active\u201d phones there, only. And if I\u2019m right, then that\u2019s what I expected you to include in the article itself in [my] point B, \u2018my friend\u2019. \ud83d\ude0c\nSince readers have to get to the bottom of the comments [to understand] what\u2019s crucial. That\u2019s how it is. The article is about phones that support Dual SIM dual Volte. The two SIMs are still arranged in Dual SIM dual Standby configuration. Sorry for the confusion. I meant that when both SIM aren\u2019t being used for making calls (standby), both have 4G VoLTE connectivity. Okey-dokey. So rather letting my safe-comment [which pointed-out the root of confusion] be published, you withheld it in lieu of admitting your trivial mistake whilst acting transparent on that error. \u2018Nyways: Your Blog. Your whim. \ud83d\ude0a\u00b0 @Maaz Kalim Your obviously a very bad Techie. The article is about \u201cDual SIM Dual VoLTE Support\u201d \u2026.Not about dual sim active Volte support. There is a huge difference between standby and active. Please read and update your knowledge. Hey \u2018Anon\u2019, how\u2019s the business at YouTube\u00ae powered by Google+\u00ae going? \ud83d\ude0f hi deepak r u sure that oneplus 6 supports DSDV. Yes. Sure. Yes perfect please keep us updated about oneplus6 and redmi note 5 pro future support of dsdv what about one plus 6? is it with DSDV? We will only know after the phone goes official on May 17 redmi note 5 phone is awesome as all the mi product How about Nokia 7 plus? I think it is coming with SD660, which naturally supports DSDV Chipset support is not enough. OEM has to enable the feature too. For instance, Snapdragon 636 supports DSDV but Redmi Note 5 Pro is missing this feature as of now. Redimi note  pro supports dual volte after update to 8.1 Oreo Thanks for the update. We have updated the post accordingly. Hi Krishna, We have tested Nokia 7 Plus now. It does not support dual SIM dual VoLTE as of now. This week Nokia 7 plus got OTA update and Dual SIM Volte support added. Yup. It seems you forgot Oppo F7 latest device. The MTP60 chipset does support dual volte functionality. Hi Ankit, thanks for pointing that out. we will test it and add it to our list. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.  \n\n  \u0394"]}
