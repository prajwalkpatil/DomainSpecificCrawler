Made of red sandstone and marble, Qutub Minar is a 73-metre (240 feet) tall tapering tower of five storeys, with a 14.3 metre (47 feet) base diameter, reducing to 2.7 metres (9 feet) at the peak. It contains a spiral staircase of 379 steps. Its design is thought to have been based on the Minaret of Jam, in western Afghanistan. Humayun's tomb (Maqbara e Humayun) is the tomb of the Mughal Emperor Humayun in Delhi, India. The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress Bega Begum (also known as Haji Begum), in 1569-70, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas, a Persian architect chosen by her. It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent, and is located in Nizamuddin East, Delhi, India, close to the Dina-panah Citadel, also known as Purana Qila (Old Fort), that Humayun founded in 1533. It was also the first structure to use red sandstone at such a scale. The tomb was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993, and since then has undergone extensive restoration work, which is complete. Besides the main tomb enclosure of Humayun, several smaller monuments dot the pathway leading up to it, from the main entrance in the West, including one that even pre-dates the main tomb itself, by twenty years; it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niyazi, an Afghan noble in Sher Shah Suri's court of the Suri dynasty, who fought against the Mughals, constructed in 1547 CE.

Our astrology experts only predict based on date of birth, year of birth for all people born on September 17, 1950, not specifically for the Prime Minister of India. Before we can give a horoscope, read about the personality of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we need to know his date of birth as well as his biography. Political Affiliation He is the current Prime Minister of India. His full name is Narendra Damodardas Modi. He was born on 17 September 1950 at Vadnagar, Mehsana Gujarat. On 30 May 2019, he was sworn in as India's Prime Minister marking the start of his second term in office. He is also the longest-serving Chief Minister of Gujarat (October 2001 to May 2014). He is a personality of motivation who rose from a poverty-stricken tea-selling boy to a development-oriented leader. Narendra Damodardas Modi was born to a family of grocers in a town called Vadnagar in Mehsana district of Gujarat. He was born on 17 September, 1950 to Damodardas Mulchand Modi and Heeraben Modi. The couple had six children among which Narendra Modi was the third eldest. In his childhood days, he had faced several difficulties and obstacles, but he took all the challenges positively and transformed them into opportunities with courage and strength. After joining RSS, he learned the spirit of selflessness, social responsibility, dedication, and nationalism. As www.elections.in reported, one of his brothers, Somabhai, is a retired health officer who now runs an old age home in the city of Ahmedabad. Another of his brothers Prahlad, an activist on behalf of fair-price shop owners, has his own fair-price shop in Ahmedabad. His third brother Pankaj is employed with the Information Department in Gandhinagar. Modi completed his studies against all odds. His saga of struggle began when as a teenager, he, along with his brother, used to run a tea stall near a railway station in Ahmedabad. He did his schooling from Vadnagar and obtained a master's degree in Political Science from Gujarat University. One of his school teachers described him as an average student but a brilliant debater. During his college days, he worked as a 'pracharak' (promoter) of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He left home at the age of 17 years and travelled across the country for the next two years. At the age of 20, as jagranjosh.com reported, he was so influenced by the RSS that he became the full-time Pracharak and he had formally joined RSS in 1971 at the age of 21. In his area, in the early 1970s, he set up a unit of RSS's students wing namely Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. No doubt, his association with the organisation has significantly benefited his political career. He has completed the Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the School of Open Learning at the University of Delhi and later he had completed his Master's degree in political science from Gujarat University. Also, he was a great orator. He was interested in theatres too where he preferred playing the role of the characters which are larger than life. At a later stage, during the 1990s, when Modi served as the official spokesperson of the BJP in New Delhi, he completed a three-month long course in the US on public relations and image management. Narendra Modi always had the utmost zeal and enthusiasm to serve and help the people in need. As a young boy, Narendra Modi offered his services voluntarily to the soldiers at the railway stations during the Indo-Pak war in 1965. He also served affected people during the 1967 Gujarat floods. Modi started working in the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation\u2019s staff canteen. Eventually from there he became a full-time proponent and campaigner, commonly called a 'pracharak', of the RSS. Modi later underwent training at the RSS camp in Nagpur. It is a prerequisite for any RSS member to take up the training course for holding any official position in the Sangh Parivar. Narendra Modi was given charge of the student wing, which is better known as Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). His contribution to the Anti-emergency movement impressed senior political leaders. As a result of this, he was eventually appointed the regional organiser of the newly-formed Bharatiya Janata Party in Gujarat. Narendra Modi was an efficient organiser from a very young age. During the Emergency, he arranged for covert circulation of RSS pamphlets and also organised protests against the Emergency rule. During his RSS days, he met the two Jan Sangh leaders, Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, who later founded the state unit of BJP in Gujarat. In 1987, the RSS deputed Narendra Modi to politics by recommending his candidature in the BJP. Modi\u2019s efficiency was recognised and he rose to prominence after managing the Ekta Yatra for Murli Manohar Joshi. Here is the political timeline of Modi, as oneindia.com and jagranjosh.com reported: 1987: He joined the BJP and a year later he was made the general secretary of the Gujarat branch of the party. 1995: He was recognised as a key strategist for being instrumental in successfully campaigning for the party. In this year, he was appointed as the Secretary of the BJP's national unit. 1988: He became the General Secretary and holds the position till 2001. 2002: He contested from Maninagar and won the assembly election. He defeated Oza Yatinbhai Narendrakumar of Congress by 38256 votes. He was retained as Chief Minister of Gujarat. (Second Term). 2007: On 23 December 2007, Modi's third term as CM started and completed on 20 December 2012. This time again he won from Maninagar. He defeated Dinsha Patel of Congress. 2012: Modi again elected from Maninagar. This time he defeated Bhatt Shweta Sanjiv by 34097 votes. He again took oath as chief minister (fourth term). Later he resigned from assembly in 2014. 2014: Narendra Modi was elected as 14th and current Prime Minister of India. Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014. He became the first Prime Minister born after India's independence from the British Empire. 2019: Indian PM Narendra Modi has secured another five-year term after winning a landslide general election victory. He was born in Vadnagar, Gujarat, India on September 17, 1950 and is an indian politician and Prime Minister of India. Born on Sunday at 11:00 hours. So, his zodiac signs is a Virgo (August 23 - September 22) which belongs to the Earth element of astrology, along with Taurus and Capricorn. Those born between October 23 and November 22 can generally assume that their sun sign is Scorpio. Mutable earth sign and has as its guiding planet Mercury and shows a remarkable intelligence and a remarkable ability to manage their assets and those of his family. It is usually a saver and only buy useful things in his life. Unwilling to worldly life but knows staying with friends. Mercury gives him a good deal of communication skills and this can bewitch people. Especially in love, thanks to its appearance, it can win many partners but once choose one knows to be faithful even if it proves to be not just a volcano at the transport level of passion. Usually enjoys good health to the bones with some problems. Big and methodical worker, very attentive to every detail, details known to be realistic, concrete although it may prove too insecure in various life situations. To be selected as a partner working or because the employee can entrust any task and then give him a lot of confidence. Maintaining high standard: Virgos have a highly tuned sense of style, quality and taste. They\u2019re like the zodiac\u2019s \u2018Quality Control Officers\u2019, maintaining high standards across everything in their realm (including YOU). This default wiring towards \u2018the best\u2019 can tip over into judging, sniping and griping when they spot things which don\u2019t meet their exacting expectations, as cosmopolitan.com reported. Modest: You will rarely find a Virgo boasting, bragging or showboating - it\u2019s just not their style. Even world-beating achievements are presented with a humble shrug and a self-depreciating comment. Left unchecked, this modesty can turn into a self-confidence dip, and their critical inner judge can take over, highlighting their flaws and negatives at max volume, making them think they\u2019re not good enough and don\u2019t deserve their spot. Be kind to your Virgo friends (even if they\u2019re not always kind to you). They can really beat themselves up privately. Hard workers: Virgos are born conscientious. They evolve into diligent perfectionists who can\u2019t bear to see anything delivered in a shoddy way and will happily take on extra to avoid that happening. There\u2019s a fine line here, though, between working hard in the team and becoming a monstrous control freak who tries to do everyone else\u2019s job for them. Helpful: Virgos seriously LOVE helping other people out, proving their worth, being leaned on, feeling valued. However, they do (quietly, mind you) expect gratitude, recognition and maybe a lil\u2019 reward. They won\u2019t ever state this overtly (too crass), they\u2019ll just ramp up the favours/tasks completed in the hope you WILL HAVE TO acknowledge it. This can become a vicious circle because, eventually, others take this level of servitude for granted and this then really annoys Virgos. Internally, the inner judge is unleashed, harping on about other people\u2019s lack of manners/gratitude/morals etc\u2026 Just say \u2018thank you\u2019 when your Virgo pal does you a solid. Observant: While their memory can serve as an excellent tool for them, it also is the reason for their anxiety. Sadly, they may think of an incident that happened to them years ago and cringe at the fact that they let it happen. They will worry so much that their worrying gets the best of them in many situations, as Your Tango reported. Critical: They may be good at critical thinking, but they are also known for how critically they view others. Without even really taking into consideration how judgmental they are, sometimes they feel like people aren\u2019t trying hard enough or as hard as they are. Stubborn: Once a Virgo has a vision of what they want, no one can tell them otherwise. Even if someone has an idea to guide a Virgo in a better direction, the Virgo will most likely shut down and not listen to them. Virgos are very defiant. Uptight: Sometimes Virgos need to learn how to chill. They overwork and worry themselves very easily and are the queens of not letting go. Virgo's friends are key in helping them learn to loosen up. Overly solicitous: Virgos are people pleasers. Virgos love making sure everyone around them is always happy. This leads them to push themselves to the back of their mind. They can forget to take of themselves and their need to please everyone becomes very unhealthy. Picky: Virgos like to be precise in their decisions and have a specific image for almost everything, whether it be men, food, or even types of TV shows they'll watch. Their pickiness stops them from going with the flow of life. The Sun and Venus are both in Virgo. With this double membership of Virgo, your affectivity is clearly selective. More than others, you need to control your affectivity and the relationship you are involved in. You sort out, you select, you observe, relentlessly, to the extent that you place yourself and your partner in a pattern where your respective role, function and raison d'\u00eatre are specified. Therefore, it is useless to peddle the virtues of a current, the benefits of a fashionable way to love or of trendy attitudes. You remain faithful to\u2026 your principles. You prefer clarity of relationships to passionate tumults. This is probably the reason why you are credited with modesty and reserve. It is not that your affectivity is withdrawn \u2013 on the contrary, you are sensitive because you are vulnerable. However, you are distrustful of impulses that may gratuitously destabilize your relationship. You are more reliable than you are demonstrative, more loyal than exuberant, you fully express yourself within a couple based on the principle of complementarity: your partner's naturalness and spontaneity nurture your affectivity, whereas your reliability and your sense of moderation efficiently protect your couple against life's vagaries. Although it is theoretical, this pattern allows the emergence of amorous behaviours that are, by nature, too discreet or too timid. Narendra Modi, inside himself, feelings are strong and powerful. However, he never show them before weighing up and considering all the possible consequences of words and actions: fieriness and spontaneousness are toned down because he cannot help controlling yourself, probably due to his modesty, his discretion or his shyness. According to kamalkapoor.com, Narendra Modi is having Libra Ascendant ( Tula Lagna) and Moon in Scorpio ( Vrischik ) and having Anuradha Nakshatra ( as star constellation ). Before discussing further let us check the positive/negative aspects inherited by the native by virtue of being born under Anuradha Nakshatra in general. Person may inherit some or most of positive & negative aspects. Anuradha is a nakshatra associated with success and can produce fame and recognition. This nakshatra utilizes both intuition and rationality coupled with logic to achive profound understanding of numbers and calculations. Traveling ,fame & success in foreign lands is backed by this nakshatra. People born under Anuradha nakshatra are capable of leading and organizing large groups of people, and they are most suited to become Leaders. Much the same as the Lotus bloom , Anuradha has the persistence and ability to blossom in the amidst difficult circumstances, which we have seen as how shri Modi conquered his extremely difficult years of childhood & youth and blossom in to am tremendous leader of people. On negative side people having Anuradha Nakshatra are guarded and secretive, rebellious, susceptible of falling prey to bad guidance & advice, jealous and controlling of others etc. According to thehoroscope.co, people born on September 17 are honorable and have a great sense of duty. They are youthful and amicable with most people but they are also pretentious and one can rapidly fall in disgrace. They dislike having to deal with indifferent people and hate nothing more than vanity. They are correct and unfailing but also very precise in most of their enterprises. They feel best when they can engage in enterprises with people who are as intelligent and elegant as they are. The natives in this sign are unfailing and certain and this is what they expect from others in return. They are rational and circumspect but can also launch themselves in courageous projects, but only when they've checked all facts at least once. They are revolutionary but orderly and don't let their train of thoughts disrupt them from the initial things they were working on. These natives rarely forget and excuse so don't be surprised if you are not in their grace because of something that occurred years ago. They are overly attentive to every detail when they are focused on something and they follow and judge every small mistake although when it comes to their own faults, they often try to hide them or transformation the subject. Lovers born on September 17 are loyal and affectionate. They may not be those partners with whom you party and go on crazy adventures but they sure are those with whom you want to settle. They see a relationship as the union between two souls and are 100% committed once they take settle. They are attracted to intelligent and trustworthy persons whom can offer the same degree of reliability as them. You can conquer the heart of Virgo by being an honest and supportive partner. Charming lovers they are always enthusiastic although sometimes unpredictable and hard to understand. If their loved one is patient and honest they are likely to open to them and their love will progress fast. They are friendly but reserved and their attitude won\u2019t bring many people close to them. They are persistent and courageous in a practical way so they will be a great part of their family team once they decide to settle for someone. They are most compatible with those born on 1st, 4th, 8th, 10th, 13th, 17th, 19th, 22th, 26th, 28th and 31st. September 17 Zodiac people are most attached to the other two earth signs: Taurus and Capricorn as they tend to share the same vision of life. In love, Virgo is in a constant search for someone to nurture, help grow and to whom they can give everything they have and the best to offer this occasion to them is the native in Pisces. The least compatible with people born on September 17 are those born under Leo. As for the rest of compatibilities between the other star signs and Virgo, you know what they say, stars predispose but people dispose. Tiger is the 1950 Chinese zodiac sign. And according to Chinese Five Elements, people born in 1950 year of the Tiger belong to the Metal Tiger. As astrologyk reported, the TIGER is a born leader, fiercely competitive, and never afraid to fight. Tigers often get into difficult and hazardous situations because they live dangerously. Narrow-mindedness and suspiciousness are their greatest faults. Their careers exemplifies them as deep thinkers and careful planners. Tigers are likely to succeed in sales, personnel management. They can be a good military leader, supervisors, teachers, firemen, or police officers. Under the influence of the Metal Element, the Metal Tiger becomes one of the most confident and self-interested of all the Tiger signs. When there is a goal that the Metal Tiger wishes to achieve, it will be met with focus and determination. In this sense, the Metal Tiger can be an exceptional leader, as long as their word is considered law. The Metal Tiger can be a great friend, but as an enemy, their uncompromising passion can prove to be very difficult to overcome. The self-interest of the Metal Tiger makes material and professional gains very important in their life. In this sense, their drive for success and fearlessness would be well-suited for the competitive fields of business or perhaps entrepreneurship, which was the case for Metal tiger Richard Branson. Similarly, the Metal Tiger can find success in management, teaching or administration. Those born under the Metal Tiger sign can always pursue their dreams, no matter what obstacle; a fact that can be seen in the life of Stevie Wonder, who was also born in 1950. At times, the passionate Metal Tiger runs the risk of being to self-centered and self-confident. In these times, the Metal Tiger has difficulty realizing their own shortcomings or flaws in logic. However, with time, the Metal Tiger can learn to consider the interests and opinions of others in their decision making process. Creative in their passion, Tigers will never bore their partners. They\u2019re expressive, polite and trustworthy, but watch out. Tigers tend to dominate their relationships. This tendency is instinctive and when monitored closely, such behavior can be kept under control. Partners need to be equally active to keep up with the Tiger\u2019s sense of adventure. Assertive, competitive and sharp, once Metal Tigers set their sights on their goals there\u2019s no stopping them. They\u2019ll always do what\u2019s necessary to remain at the center of attention. Metal Tigers tend to jump to conclusions; a behavior they need to work at improving. Things that will bring Tigers luck: Lucky numbers: 1, 3, and 4 and numbers containing them (like 13 and 43) Lucky days: the 16th and 27th of any Chinese lunar month Lucky colors: blue, gray, orange Lucky flowers: yellow lily, cineraria Lucky direction: east, north, south Lucky months: the 3rd, 7th, and 10th Chinese lunar months. Entering 2022, Tiger people born in 1950 are 72 years old, and it is a rough year for them. Because of the interference of unlucky stars brought by the Zodiac Year of Birth (Benmingnian), they would face a lot of problems in several aspects of life. It is hard for them to make much progress in career because most people are retired. Even for those still searching for jobs or running business, there would not be good opportunities. Because of the age and physical condition, many employers would not consider hiring them. Therefore, be rational about it, learn to accept the reality, and don't get upset if things don't work out. In 2022, as travelchinaguide.com reported, they have favorable financial fortune. At this age, most of them have a lot of savings, and their life expenses are not high. As long as they plan well, they can enjoy a comfortable life with ample supply. There is no need to worry about money. Their fortune in relationship is average this year. By this age, most Tiger people have better temper and are able to put themselves in other people's shoes. In addition, they are more aware of the importance of the family, so their love life is relatively stable at this stage, and there are almost no major conflicts with their partners. However, people born in 1950 are relatively straightforward and do not care about others' feelings. Sometimes they argue with their partners over trivial matters. Try to avoid this as frequent arguments can not only affect the harmony of a relationship, but also cause health problems. The health status of Tiger people born in 1950 is not ideal in 2022. Those who were in good health may be bothered by sudden outbreaks of disease. In addition, after aging, the body resistance is not as good as before. It is easy to for them to suffer from some serious diseases. Especially for those who have chronic diseases, they must observe the changes of the body. Once there is discomfort, they should go to the hospital in time for examination and medical treatment. Do not believe in those folk prescriptions which may delay the treatment. Pay special attention to potential risk factors this year, stay away from crowded places, and be careful when walking up and down stairs. Best Match: Horse, Dog, Pig Worst Match: Snake, Monkey In terms of the relationship with the people under other animal signs, the people born in the year of the Tiger can be harmonious with the people born in the year of the Pig, Dog, Horse, Rabbit, Sheep, Rooster and the Tiger itself. The honest and nice Pig can usually help the Tiger to avoid doing things rashly and make the Tiger feel safe. The practical Dog can be good partner with the Tiger and is very loyal to him. What's more, they can not only restrain the Tiger, but also make them rational. The people born in the year of the Horse are active as the Tiger, but usually can forebode the danger much faster than the Tiger. So, the Tiger can benefit from the Horse from it. However, as yourchineseastrology.com reported, the Tiger should never challenge to the Ox people, for the Ox would not tolerant the misbehavior of the Tiger and may destroy him. The Tiger is not compatible with the Snake as well. As the Snake is gentle, timid and calm while the Tiger is arrogant, it is difficult for them to live harmoniously. Another person that the Tiger couldn't be friend with is the Monkey. As the smart Monkey likes to laugh at the Tiger endlessly and the Tiger only knows to be angry as a result of being fooled. 1950 Metal Tiger in a nutshell: Style: Brilliant and protective; Top qualities: Optimistic, caring and witty; Challenges: Vain, superficial and arrogant; Advice: They need to prioritize some things in their lives.

Every lens comes with a certain specification which allows us to know what it can be used for.\u00a0Usually, there are two numbers in the title, each specifying a certain quality. Before making the purchase, it is important to know what f/1.8 means on a lens. Contents F/1.8 describes the ratio of the aperture to the focal length of the lens. F/1.8 also implies that it is a wide aperture and will allow more light to enter the camera. Thus, it will be able to capture better images in lowlight conditions. Aperture refers to the opening through which light enters a camera. Aperture allows you to control the depth of field, and through that, you can add dimensions to your images. An aperture around the f/1.2 to f/2.8 would be known as a wide aperture while an aperture around f/4 would be a narrow one.\u00a0 Wide apertures allow you to capture blurred backgrounds with a shallow depth of field. They are good for capturing Bokeh effects. On the contrary, a narrow aperture would give you sharp areas on every part of the image and this is good for capturing landscapes. Moreover, the wideness of an aperture impacts the exposure of a photograph. A wide aperture lets in more light and is thus ideal for low light conditions. On the contrary, a narrow aperture is not ideal for these conditions. An f/1.8 is known as a \u2018fast\u2019 aperture and can be paired up with other settings such as shutter speed, and ISO level to capture a wide range of effects. The f/1.8 aperture lenses are usually used for portraits, bokeh, and low light conditions. A wide aperture such as f/1.8 allows you to blur the background, focus on the subject and thus create a beautiful Bokeh. This makes for good portrait images whether indoor or outdoor. It makes sure that the subject is separated from the background.\u00a0 If it is paired with a high resolution (above 20 megapixels) camera, it can get you very detailed portrait images and can be used for fashion and product photography too. Follow these steps to capture a great Bokeh: You can use an f/1.8 aperture lens in low-light settings to capture focused and clear images. This is because a wide aperture such as this captures more light and thus you can keep your shutter speeds below 1/200 seconds to avoid motion blurs. Also, with a wide aperture, you can keep the ISO levels on your camera below 500 to reduce noise in your photos. This makes the f/1.8 great for indoor photography such as church weddings, and architectural shots. In addition, star photography can be done with wide apertures too. Here, you can keep the ISO levels as high as possible (most cameras offer up to 25600) and slow shutter speed (above 10 seconds) to capture as much light as possible. There are not a lot of differences between these two because both are wide apertures. However, f/2.2 is considered lighter, smaller, and low-priced. On the other hand, the f/1.8 can let in a lot of light and perform better in low light conditions. Thus, it depends on the situation at hand. While a wide aperture is better for portraits, Bokeh, and low light conditions, a narrow aperture will be sought by photographers who want to capture landscapes and architectural photographers thanks to its overall sharpness. Thus, there is no absolute answer here. It depends on what you are trying to capture. The f/1.8 on a lens depicts the ratio between the aperture and the focal length. f/1.8 aperture lenses are wide apertures and can be used in low light conditions, portrait photography, and for Bokeh."], "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-narendra-modi-got-a-first-class-in-ma-from-gujarat-university/articleshow/52061558.cms": [" Don\u2019t miss out on ET Prime stories!

Heeraben herself is passing her life these days in a wheelchair as she is too old to walk now. But her love and affection for her country and even towards her son can be seen in recent pictures that have been released by the Indian News agency recently. Contents Since the results of the 2022 legislative election have been announced this 10 March 2022 in which BJP has got success in getting 4 states under their leadership except for Punjab, has made Prime Minister Modi very happy that he rushed next day to meet his mother Heeraben. He visited to meet his mother on 11th March 2022 Night to get her blessing for further success in his career. Heeraben is currently spending her life at her other son Pankaj Modi\u2019s house situated in Raysan area of the beautiful outskirts of Gandhinagar Gujarat. Pictures are getting viral in media in which Heeraben can be seen having dinner with her son Narendra Modi. Both together had an Indian traditional dish called \u201cKhichdi\u201d in their dinner. When PM arrived to meet his mother a crowd was standing out at his brother\u2019s house to meet PM of India and congratulated him on his big win once again. Telling you more about Heeraben than she met her son after a gap of two years due to the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the busy schedule of her son. Heeraben who was too old to handle her daily routine was born when India was under the governance of Britishers before 1947 independence. People who have been born before 1947 are rarely a high school pass out in India. We guess Heeraben may have completed her studies till 4 to 5th standard of any government school of Gujarat. However, Heeraben\u2019s every kid is well educated and even Prime Minister Modi too. Narendra Modi is a Bachelor\u2019s degree holder of the 1978 batch of SOL (School of Open Learning) affiliated with Delhi University. He is also a master\u2019s degree holder from Gujarat University. Heeraben who herself is passing from 101 years of her age has never opened up about her family life in media. We guess that to date all of Heeraben\u2019s siblings may have died and she is only left in her family. Earlier in the month of April 27, 2021, the sad news was ott related to Narendra Modi\u2019s aunt who may be a sister of Heeraben. Aunt of Narendra Modi named Narmadaben Modi died due to Covid-19 spread in her body. This news was shared by Heeraben\u2019s youngest son Pankaj Modi. Other than this Heeraben was born to Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community that is categorized as the OBC (Other Backward Class) community in India. It is hard to define what Heeraben has done to earn income for her family after getting married. According to our research Heeraben has spent her life in poverty as she got married earlier with her husband Damodardas Mulchand Modi. Her husband was a Tea Seller and has hardly earned income for his family by selling Tea at the local of Gujarat. But now she is spending a good life as her every children\u2019s is well settled and working. Talking about her son Narendra Modi then he gets a monthly pay of 280000 INR out of which he donates a high ratio of his income in charity and submits the remaining to her mother\u2019s account. Heeraben was married to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (Tea Seller). Her husband died in 1989 at the age of 74. Marrying to Damodardas Mulchand Modi she gave birth to her six children and her third kid born was Narendra Modi who was born on 17th September 1950. Heeraben Modi\u2019s other kids\u2019 names include Soma Modi, Amrut Modi, Prahlad Modi, Pankaj Modi and\u00a0 Vasantiben Hasmukhlal Modi. Her son Amrut Modi is spending his life as a retired Lathe Machine Operator. Prahlad Modi is running his shop in Gujarat. Soma Modi is retired from the Health Department of Gujarat. Whereas Pankaj Modi is working as a clerk in the Information Department of Gujarat. There is no information that may reveal Heeraben Modi\u2019 Net worth. She has spent her life as a homemaker and has not earned anything on her own. But her son Narendra Modi before competing for his Loksabha 2014 election has shared his affidavit sharing his net worth during that year. He was holding a Net worth of 1.65 Crore INR in 2014, 1.33 Core in 2012, and 42 lakh INR in 2007. She is a citizen of Gujarat and a mother of Narendra Modi the Prime Minister of India. Heeraben is all 5 feet tall. The mother of Narendra Modi was born in 1920. Yes, she is alive as of March 2022 She is living her life in her 101st years of age.  \n\n\n Munish Sehgal is an Indian writer from Punjab, India. He loves to create content on the internet.

These types of sensors change the data into an electrical signal on the movement or occurrence of a target. These sensors are used in mobile phones. Once the target is in a small range, then the lock screen of the mobile user interface will come into view which is called sleep mode. These sensors can be utilized to identify air gestures through the collection of proximity sensing elements. The main purpose of this sensor is to notice the object without any physical contact with it. The utmost distance detected by this sensor is called a normal range. This kind of sensor produces an electromagnetic field otherwise utilizes IR radiation to generate a light beam. This article discusses an overview of proximity sensors and their working. A non-contact sensor that is used to detect the presence of a target or object is called a proximity sensor. This sensor is capable of detecting close-by objects through electromagnetic radiation beams or electromagnetic fields without any physical contact. The detection of the target can be done based on the kind of proximity sensor by using light, sound, electromagnetic fields, IR, etc. Proximity Sensor This sensor is most frequently used in mobile phones, so the role of the proximity sensor in mobile is to detect a nearby person. For instance, an IR proximity sensor is used in mobile phones to detect a human ear when the operator places the phone on the ear, then the mobile display will be turned off automatically, so power consumption can be reduced. A non-contact sensor like a proximity sensor detects the existence of a target once it enters the field of the sensor. The detection of a target can be done based on the kind of sensor by using light, sound, IR otherwise electromagnetic fields. These kinds of sensors are utilized in recycling plants, phones, anti-aircraft systems, assembly lines & self-driving cars. There are different kinds of proximity sensors available where each sensor detects targets in dissimilar methods. There are different kinds of proximity sensors used in different applications but each type of sensor detects an object in a different way they are inductive proximity, capacitive proximity, ultrasonic proximity, and optical proximity. But the most frequently used proximity sensors are inductive proximity & capacitive proximity. These are contactless sensors used for detecting metal objects. This kind of sensor mainly depends on the induction law. Once a metallic object approaches it, then it drives an oscillator through a coil. This sensor includes two versions & includes four essential components which are discussed below.\nThe versions of inductive proximity sensors are unshielded and shielded Shielded Version In the shielded version, the generated electromagnetic field is concentrated in the face, where the sensor coil sides are covered up Unshielded Version In the unshielded version, the generated electromagnetic field through the sensor coil is clear, so it allows for wider & greater detecting distances. Inductive proximity sensor includes four major components like an oscillator, coil, Schmitt trigger, & output switching circuit. When an AC is provided to the sensor coil, an electromagnetic detection field can be generated. Once a metal object is placed near the magnetic field, then eddy currents can be formed & result in coil inductance alters. Once coil inductance alters, then the circuit will change the output switch of the sensor which is monitoring continuously. Here whenever a target is not there, these sensors oscillate continuously and when an object is there then only the switch will trigger. The inductive proximity sensor is mainly used for industrial and security purposes like metal object detection, land mines, automation machine production, etc. These types of sensors are also contactless, used to notice both the objects like metallic & non-metallic that includes powders, liquid, granular, etc. This sensor works by noticing a change within capacitance.\nLikewise to inductive type, it includes an oscillator, switching circuit for output & Schmitt trigger. The main difference is it includes two charging plates like one internal & one external for capacitance. The connection of these two plates can be done like this; the internal plate is connected to the oscillator whereas the external plate is used as the detecting surface. This kind of proximity sensor generates an electrostatic field. Once an object reaches the detecting region, then both plate\u2019s capacitance also increases those results in amplitude gain of an oscillator. This gain activates the output switch of the sensor. These sensors oscillate only once the target is present.\nThe applications of capacitive proximity sensors include Industrial processes, controlling moisture, touch applications, etc These sensors are one kind of proximity sensor that is utilized in several applications of automation as well as manufacturing. The main purpose of this sensor is to detect objects and measurement of distance. These sensors are used in processing beverages, food & several packaging applications. The frequency range of these sensors is higher than the audible sound of humans approximately 20 kHz. The basic principle of this sensor is to transmit an ultrasonic signal & gets a signal back. By using the time disparity among these signals, the distance toward the target can be decided. An ordinary design for both the transmitter & the receiver within the similar physical housing, even though they can also be placed in separate units such as certain photoelectric sensors through separate detectors & emitters. Arranging the transmitter & receiver within the same unit can reduce the cabling and installation. These sensors use sound instead of light, so they can be utilized wherever these sensors have complexity like detecting plain plastic labels and objects, surfaces with extremely reflective that discard optical sensors. These are also resistant to general contaminants like moisture, ambient light & dust. Generally, these sensors are cost-effective as compared to inductive & capacitive types. These are applicable in automated systems as they can arrange into small locations. These sensors are also called light beam sensors. An optical proximity sensor contains a sensor and a light source. A sensor is used to detect the light whereas a light source produces light. The light sensor in this sensor is normally a semiconductor device like a photodiode that produces less light once light energy strikes it. There are different types of proximity sensors available like through-beam, retro-reflective & diffuser. The applications of optical proximity sensors mainly include computer alarm systems, copy machines, light fixtures, etc. The magnetic proximity sensor simply detects the magnetic field based on mechanical principles. They detect the presence of a magnetic target which is characterized through its magnetic field. Once it enters the range of the sensor detection, then it activates the switching procedure. These sensors are mainly used for detecting non-contact locations away from the typical ranges of inductive sensors. The operating principles used by this sensor are GMR inductive, reed switches, magnetoresistive, variable reluctance otherwise Hall Effect sensors. The features of the proximity sensor include the following. On every phone, the proximity sensor is the main feature but sometimes its role cannot be understated in our devices. This sensor mainly assists gestures & notices our facial features on phones. Some of the most frequently reported sensor problems to include the following that may occur because of Software otherwise Hardware issues. Verify whether your mobile goes into sleep mode while making calls, the sensor will be immobilized and enters into sleep mode. So in this condition, push the power switch to activate the mobile screen back on. If the error happens in other situations, determine the position of the sensor. This will be changed through the mobile model. To fix the above issues, here are some solutions. An infrared proximity sensor is one kind of electronic device used to notice the existence of a target once it comes to a fixed range from this sensor throughout reflected IR rays. Here this circuit is built with a normal operational amplifier like LM358. Proximity Sensor Circuit Diagram The essential components used to build this circuit are The working principle of this circuit is quite easy. A typical idea includes two LEDs that are parallel to each other to the target like a photodiode & IR emitting led. Both these act like a pair of transmitter-receiver. Once an obstruction approaches before emitter waves, they are reproduced back & interrupted through the receiver. According to the photodiode propertied, the interrupted IR waves will reduce the resistance of the photodiode and the resultant electric signal is generated. This signal in practice is the voltage across the 10k resistor which is directly fed to the non-inverting end of the op-amp. The operational amplifier\u2019s main function is to evaluate the two inputs specified to it. The photodiode signal can be given to pin 3 (non-inverting) & the potentiometer\u2019s threshold voltage can be given to pin 2 (inverting pin). If the voltage is higher at the non-inverting pin as compared to the inverting pin voltage then the output of an op-amp output is high or low. Here in this circuit, the operational amplifier changes the signal from analog form to digital. The output of the sensor can be used in two forms like analog & digital. Analog output values range continuously from zero to finite value. This signal directly cannot be given to the motor drivers as well as other switching devices. Primarily, they have to be processed through the microcontrollers & changed into digital form using analog to digital converter. This form of output needs an extra microcontroller however removes the use of an operational amplifier. The form of digital output is available either low or high. The proximity sensor\u2019s digital output signal is mainly useful to prevent the motion of the robot which is used for avoiding obstacles. Once an obstacle comes near to the robot, then the signal can be directly given to the motor driver\u2018s input pins to prevent the motors.

Please refer to this link to know more about Color Sensor & Gyroscope Sensor. Thus, this is all about an overview of proximity sensors and their working with applications. The advantages of proximity sensor are; it doesn\u2019t include mechanical parts, so the lifespan of this sensor is high, reliability is high; the working principle is simple circuits are simple and low-cost devices. The applications of this sensor mainly include position, detection, automated machine counting, inspection, consumer products, and robotics.

Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament from Varanasi.

He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has reminisced about helping out after school at his father's tea stall at the Vadnagar railway station. At age 18, Modi was married to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He first publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi has asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of emergency was declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.[lower-alpha 3] Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots in which 1044 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim,[lower-alpha 4] or otherwise criticised for its management of the crisis. A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally.[lower-alpha 5] While his policies as chief minister\u2014credited with encouraging economic growth\u2014have received praise, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[lower-alpha 6] Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the lower house of Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social welfare programmes. Modi centralised power by abolishing the Planning Commission and replacing it with the NITI Aayog. He began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and a transformation of the taxation regime, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. He oversaw the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Prime Minister, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings.[12][13][14] Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding.[15][16][lower-alpha 7] Following his party's victory in the 2019 general election, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act and three controversial farm laws, which prompted widespread protests and sit-ins across the country, resulting in a formal repeal of the latter. Described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.[lower-alpha 8] Oops something went wrong: "], "https://www.india.com/news/india/its-official-pms-new-address-is-7-lok-kalyan-marg-race-course-road-no-more-1503973/": ["  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated: September 21, 2016 7:47 PM IST  \n\n\n \n\n              By India.com News Desk \n\n\n\n\n\n New Delhi, September 21: Continuing its renaming of significant roads and streets in the national capital, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lead New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) on Wednesday, changed the name of the India Prime Minister\u2019s address from 7, Race Course Road to 7, Lok Kalyan Marg. The announcement was made at a press conference\u00a0attended by NDMC Chairman Naresh Kumar, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Meenakshi Lekhi, the BJP MP who represents New Delhi constituency in Parliament. This comes a day after Lekhi had put a proposal before the Municipal Corporation to rename Race Course Road as Ekatma Marg.\nAlso Read: \n10th Edition Of South Asia's Premier International Textile Sourcing Show To Start On Thursday In Delhi53-year-old Woman Beaten To Death By Neighbours In DelhiIndiGo in Collaboration With DGCA Launch 'Digital e-logbook' For Pilots  \u201cThere is nothing bigger than Lok Kalyan (public welfare). Everybody rose above politics and took a united decision to rename the road,\u201d Lekhi, a member of the New Delhi Municipal Council that is in charge of central Delhi,\u00a0said on Wednesday. Meenakshi Lekhi\u2019s proposal to change the name was based on her argument that the name \u2018Race Course Road\u2019\u00a0\u201cdoes not match with Indian culture\u201d. The name that she suggested- Ekatma Marg- was a tribute to the founder of the BJP, Deen Dayal Upadhyay and his philosophy of \u201cinternal humanism\u201d. This follows a string of name changing decisions made by the central government in Delhi, last year. The famous Aurangzeb Road was changed to\u00a0Abdul Kalam Marg, amid mixed reactions. The change in name of Aurangzeb road was recommended by BJP leader Mahesh Girri, who argued that the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, after who the road was named, was a brutal figure in the history of India. Many historians had, however, snubbed the government and blamed them for attempting to tamper with history. Next came the renaming of Gurgaon to Gurugram, which was met with considerable criticism from all quarters. Demands were also made to rename Akbar Road as Maharana Pratap Road, but the government rejected the demands. After the renaming, a triumphant Lekhi declared her happiness on Twitter.\u00a0ALSO READ:\u00a0Rename PM\u2019s address Race Course Road as Ekatma Marg: Meenakshi Lekhi to NDMC 7RCR is now 7LKM!NDMC renames Race Course Road to Lok Kalyan Marg pic.twitter.com/OSzYkirAhH \u2014 TIMES NOW (@TimesNow) September 21, 2016 \u201cCongrats!

Smartphones now have cameras that can sometimes give the professional camera hardware a run for their money, all thanks to cutting-edge engineering, and mature computational algorithms. Yes, the software does play a major role, but still camera specs like the sensor, lens, and pixels matter. And speaking of pixels, we come to the topic at hand \u2014 50-megapixel camera phones.  Now the megapixel count isn\u2019t the be-all-end-all of smartphone camera quality, but that isn\u2019t stopping both phone makers and customers from hopping on this bandwagon. Be that as it may, to help you the buyer choose a 50MP camera smartphone within your budget, we have listed the 12 best options on the market. Although 50MP lenses are slowly becoming common in smartphones, there are still a handful of companies that make 50MP sensors for smartphone cameras. These include Sony, Samsung, and OmniVision. While Sony announced its 50 MP IMX766 image sensor for premium and high-end smartphones that launched in 2021, OmniVision rolled out a 50MP OV50A image sensor for flagship devices.  The last one was Samsung, which announced an update to its high-resolution sensor portfolio with the 50MP ISCOCELL GN2 image sensor for top-tier smartphones. All these 50MP image sensors from Sony, Samsung, and OmniVision promise superior smartphone photography experiences, especially in high-end and premium smartphones. Google smartphones are known for their camera features and this has continued with the Pixel 6 series too. On paper, the camera technology in Pixel 6 Pro looks like the best from Google to date with a 50MP wide camera, a 12MP ultrawide camera, and a 48MP telephoto shooter. The 50MP main shooter, which has an f/1.9 aperture and 1.2 \u03bcm pixels is the camera that one will use the most. It can take high-res photos with good detail and true-to-life colors. Night Sight enables you to get good pictures in darker settings. The telephoto camera is capable of up to 4x optical zoom and gives good clicks of distant subjects. There is 20x digital zoom too, but image quality might dip if you use this. Pixel 6 Pro\u2019s zoom features are not as good as some other smartphones but would be suitable for maximum tasks. The ultrawide camera gives you a 114-degree field of view for getting more people in the frame. On the front is an 11.1MP selfie camera with an f/2.2 aperture. It gives decent portrait shots, good quality during video calls, and natural skin tones in selfies. There is up to 4k video recording. Motion mode is a new element that is designed for taking long exposure shots such as creatively blurred images of moving subjects. Real Tone enables the cameras to capture more natural-looking skin tones in photos of people of color. Magic Eraser is a new upgrade that lets you remove the subjects that you don\u2019t want to be included in your phones, i.e., photobombers. The software tweaks along with the manufacturer\u2019s already impressive camera app and hardware promise a good photography experience. Google doesn\u2019t have any plans to launch the Pixel 6 Series in India as of now but if and when it comes to India, it is expected to come in 3 colors- Cloudy White, Sorta Sunny, and Stormy Black and be priced around Rs. 64,990. Vivo X70 Pro+ has a 48MP ultra-wide camera and a 50MP camera which relies on Samsung\u2019s GN1 Sensor. Both have gimbal stabilization.

The camera setup in X70 Pro+ comes with a Zeiss T* coating certification for better transmission of light and improved image quality. There are 4 Zeiss-enabled portrait filters and Vivo\u2019s V1 imaging chip enhances photo quality at night. The smartphone has a high transmittance glass lens, which Vivo claims is used by top-end DSLR cameras. The camera\u2019s portrait mode gives excellent results, especially when used indoors where lighting can be tricky. The camera offers up to 60x zoom though good results are obtained even with 5x zoom. There is a 32MP selfie camera with an f/2.5 aperture 26mm wide which helps you capture memories wherever you go.

Photos shot in daylight but in overcast conditions come out to be average as they are over-sharpened with the edges being grainy. Close-up shots are detailed and colors are accurate. You also get an option to set the level of blur before taking a shot. Low light performance is ok while the Night Mode produces brighter images but without the best details.

The smartphone uses pixel binning to deliver 12.5MP output from its 50MP sensor. The phone sharpens images and details are well highlighted. Close-ups are good and add a soft depth to the background. Low light camera performance is not the best, but then you can\u2019t expect that in the under 15k price range. Night Mode helps capture details in shadows better and images are bright as well. For video recording, there is an ultra-steady mode but that doesn\u2019t work very well. Realme 8i starts at Rs. 13,900 and is available in Space Black and Space Purple color variants. Realme has introduced a 50MP camera with Narzo 50A and the photo quality from this camera is decent. The edges are sharp and the colors are accurate too. Night Mode claims to give good photos in low light. Ultrawide camera lens gives good group selfies and landscapes. Recording videos on this phone is very easy. 1080p videos can be recorded with good light and have an additional flashlight feature for extra brightness that you need. Narzo 50A also has a 2MP portrait lens and a 2MP macro camera both of which work ok, but don\u2019t have much of use if you want your photographs to be too accurate. Realme Narzo 50A starts at Rs. 11, 499 and comes in 2 color options-Oxygen Blue and Oxygen Green. Realme is one such brand, which always focuses on its camera department. Realme C25Y offers a triple camera setup that offers a dynamic range of images. Primary 50MP camera with the 2MP macro and 2MP depth sensors give you a broader scope to use your imagination through photos. The absence of OIS can be frustrating at times and there is an 8MP selfie camera which is decent as per price level. ALSO READ: Instagram now lets anyone share links in their stories with Link Stickers: How to The primary camera allows video recording of 1080p videos maximum, while the selfie camera is capable of recording videos of 720p maximum. Realme C25y comes in 2 color variants- Glacier Blue and Metal Gray and is priced at Rs. 11,999 in India. The camera of the Infinix Hot 11S has been upgraded to 50MP with a wide aperture of f/1.6. The camera performance of this smartphone has improved over Hot 10S, especially in low-light conditions, though more consistency in human skin tone and white balance accuracy is needed. Selfies with an 8MP shooter are decent and the details go for a toss if the lighting conditions are anything but optimal. The dedicated LED flash upfront helps you capture slightly better selfies than the screen flash selfies of the other phones in this price segment. Video recording is capped at 2k 30fps but doesn\u2019t have any stabilization, which is a downside. The other 2 cameras on the back, an AI lens, and a depth sensor are just given to make it a triple camera setup, instead, a 2MP macro lens would have been a better choice. Infinix Hot 11S begins at Rs. 10,999 in India and is available in 3 colors- 7 Degrees Purple, Green Wave, and Polar Black.

Why trust us? The MacBook Air M2 is Apple\u2019s latest swing at its fanless Air design. Like the M1 model, it\u2019s among the best laptops you can buy right now because of its excellent portability, battery life, and, above all, performance. But buying the wrong MacBook Air M2 could result in a laptop that\u2019s up to 50% slower. Seriously. In this guide, we\u2019re going to break down what the M2 MacBook Air is, the different configurations available, and answer if you should buy Apple\u2019s latest laptop. Most importantly, we\u2019ll guide you to the configuration you should buy to avoid a clear performance pitfall. The latest version of the MacBook Air comes with Apple\u2019s M2 processor. It\u2019s around 15%-20% faster than last-gen\u2019s M1 depending on the application, and the 2022 MacBook Air is the only laptop with the M2 chip outside of the 13-inch 2022 MacBook Pro. Don\u2019t by swayed by the Pro model, though. The M2 Air and Pro have largely similar performance. Compared to the last-gen M1 MacBook Air, the M2 model has a few changes. Like all Air designs, this one is fanless with a focus on portability (it\u2019s only 0.44 inch thick and 2.7 pounds). There are a few subtle design changes, though, including more rounding on the corners and a notch for the webcam that everyone loves to hate. More importantly, the M2 model comes with a Liquid Retina display, which is sharper and provides a larger color range than the screen on the M1 MacBook Air. The notch even gives you an extra 0.3 inch of screen to look at. Apple also took the time to upgrade from two speakers on the M1 model to four on the M2, as well as improve the webcam to 1080p. Apple also improved battery life with a slightly larger battery, which lasted over 21 hours in our video playback testing. That\u2019s hours above Windows laptops, even those with the best battery life. There are only two M2 MacBook Air models available that Apple has as a starting point: It seems simple enough, but the choice between these two configurations is what will determine if you have a\u00a0good\u00a0M2 MacBook Air or a bad one. Short answer: buy the 512GB model. Shortly after launching, reviewers found out that the base 256GB model uses a single NAND chip for storage, while the 512GB model and even the M1 MacBook Air use two chips. That results up to 50% slower SSD performance, making the 256GB model feel more sluggish as it struggles to read and write data to the hard drive. That\u2019s why so many people are saying to avoid the $1,200 M2 MacBook Air. It\u2019s slower than the 512GB model, sure, but the fact that it\u2019s slower than last-gen\u2019s M1 version is the kicker. For $300 extra, you\u2019re getting a much smoother laptop with the 512GB M2 MacBook Pro. It also comes with two extra GPU cores for around a 15% boost in graphics performance depending on the application (more on that below). The 512GB model also comes with a slightly larger 35W charger, which will speed up charging times by just a hair. The M2 MacBook Air is a bit different than the previous generation in that you can configure up to 24GB of Unified Memory. That doesn\u2019t mean you should, though. Between storage, the SOC, and memory, here\u2019s the configuration I\u2019d recommend: This configuration comes out to $1,600, or $100 more than the 512GB, 10-core GPU model that Apple has as a starting point. 16GB of Unified Memory is the big difference, as it can represent as much as a 25% improvement in apps like Adobe Premiere. It also provides a decent boost to coding environments like Xcode. 24GB doesn\u2019t provide that same boost, and it costs an additional $200. Most people won\u2019t even notice a performance increase with 24GB, even in apps like Premiere. The only argument for it is if you run a particularly RAM-intensive application, and even then, 16GB provides most of the benefit over 8GB. The same goes for the 10-core GPU. It\u2019s $100 more expensive and doesn\u2019t provide much of a benefit in gaming or video editing apps. It is significantly faster than the eight-core model in 3D rendering apps like Blender, though, so consider spending the extra $100 if that\u2019s your jam. If it\u2019s not, save the money. You won\u2019t see any difference. If you\u2019re sold on the M2 MacBook Air, buy the 512GB one. It\u2019s the clear choice, and the extra $300 seems like chump change considering how much faster it is compared to the 256GB one. The M2 MacBook Air isn\u2019t the best choice for everyone, though, shipping with a litany of issues that the older M1 MacBook Air didn\u2019t have. In particular, the M2 MacBook Air has issues with overheating. It doesn\u2019t have a heat spreader or fans, and the M2 gets hot enough that it has to limit its performance to stay cool. Even the M2 MacBook Pro, which comes with a fan for cooling, reaches its thermal limit and starts reducing performance. The M1 version, by contrast, has no issues with heat, which is why it received the rare Editors\u2019 Choice award in our MacBook Air M1 review. The M2 MacBook Air is more powerful, so more heat is expected. But it\u2019s not a clear choice over the M1 model. Apple\u2019s latest chip provides about an 18% boost based on our testing and a slightly larger battery. For anyone browsing the web and running basic applications, though, the extra boost won\u2019t be super relevant. This is even more important when you consider price. The M1 MacBook Air is $1,000, and as we covered above, you\u2019re almost forced into picking up the $1,500 version of the M2 MacBook Air to get the same SSD performance. That\u2019s why some people, like our resident mobile expert Andy Boxall, decided to get last-gen\u2019s model when the M2 was announced. Regardless of if you pick up the M1 or M2 model, you\u2019re getting a fantastic laptop (short of the 256GB M2 version, that is). If you decide you don\u2019t want to go with Apple for your next laptop, though, make sure to read our comparison between the M2 MacBook Air and the Dell XPS 13 Plus \u2014 they trade blows well for around the same price. Apple has released the MacBook Pro M2, as well, but the M2 Air is still a clear winner.

No.  38/37/08-P&PW(A) dated 1.9.2008 and O.M. No.  38/37/08-P&PW(A) (pt. I) dated 3.10.2008, just after their completion of the age of 79 years:  2.         The Central Administrative Tribunal, Ernakulam Bench, in its Order dated 28.7.2009 disposed of the above OA with the following advice to the Secretary, Department of Pension & Pensioners Welfare: \u201cTo consider  the representations at Annexures A-4 to A-6 along with the grounds raised in the OA and pass a suitable order within a period of two months from the date of communication of this order.\u201d  3.         In compliance of the above advice of the Hon\u2019ble CAT, the representations at Annexure A-4 to A-6 and the grounds raised in para 5 of the OA No. 504 of 2009 have been examined in the Department of Pension & Pensioners Welfare.  4.         The thrust of the argument made in the representations/OA is that a person attains the age of 80 years on completion of the age of 79 years and, therefore, the additional quantum of pension available on attaining the age of 80 years should be paid immediately on completion of the age of 79 years.  5.         The above argument of the Applicants is on account of misinterpretation of the meaning of the phrase \u201cattaining the age of\u201d. The position in the Rules regulating the service conditions of the Government servants in this respect is well settled. In accordance with Rule 56 of the Fundamental Rules applicable to the Government servants, a Government servant retires from service on the afternoon of the last day of the month in which he attains the age of 60 years.  Accordingly, a Government servant retires on the afternoon of the last day of the month in which he completes the age of 60 years and not in the month in which he completes the age of 59 years. On this analogy, the additional pension/family pension on attaining the age of 80 years has to be paid only after the pensioner completes the age of 80 years and not after he completes the age of 79 years.  6.         In para 5(M) of the OA, the Applicants have referred to the Venkataramani Iyer\u2019s Law laxicon with Legal Maxims (Reprint 1991) according to which a person attains the age of 21 years \u201con the day preceding the anniversary of his 21st Birthday\u201d. In terms of this definition itself, a person born on 5.4.1988 attains the age of 21 years on 4.4.2009 and not on 5.4.2008.  7.         It is clear from the above that a person attains the age of 80 years only when he completes the age of 80 years and not when he completes the age of 79 years. However, for the sake of convenience, it has been provided in the orders issued by this Department that the additional quantum of pension/family pension, on attaining the age of 80 years and above, would be admissible from the 1st day of the month in which the date of birth falls..  8.         In the light of the foregoing, the request of the Applicants for  payment of the additional quantum of pension available on attaining the age of 80 years  immediately on completion of the age of 79 years is not agreed to.  9.         This issues with the approval of Secretary, Department of Pension & Pensioners Welfare.

It's voice calls over a 4G LTE network, rather than the 2G or 3G connections which are usually used. We tend to think of 4G as mostly being about downloading, streaming and web browsing, and indeed that\u2019s primarily what it\u2019s been used for so far, but it can\u00a0also be used to improve calls, which is why why many networks have started offering VoLTE. Below you\u2019ll find everything you need to know about VoLTE, including which networks offer it and what\u2019s so good about it. The big advantage of VoLTE is that call quality is superior to 3G or 2G connections, as far more data can be transferred over 4G than 2G or 3G. That makes it easier to make out not only what the person on the other end of the line is saying, but also their tone of voice. Essentially it\u2019s an HD voice call and it\u2019s a much richer experience overall. VoLTE can connect calls up to twice as fast as when using 2G or 3G, and as 2G and 3G connections will still be available when there\u2019s no 4G signal, it simply means that there\u2019s greater mobile coverage overall, as without VoLTE you wouldn\u2019t be able to make or receive calls in places with a 4G signal but no 2G or 3G.  You might think that would be a rare occurrence, but some of the frequencies that 4G operates on, such as the 800MHz spectrum, have far greater reach than 2G or 3G spectrum, so you\u2019ll be able to get signal further away from a mast or in buildings which other signals struggle to penetrate. Indeed, Three is fully relying on its 800MHz spectrum for VoLTE calls. However, while 2G and 3G services have largely remained so far they aren\u2019t as necessary as they used to be, and much of the spectrum used for 2G in particular could potentially be repurposed to increase capacity on 4G or 5G networks. Smartphone users could also find their battery life increased with VoLTE, as without it\u00a0whenever you make or receive a call your phone has to switch from 4G to 2G or 3G, since 4G calls aren\u2019t supported,\u00a0and then once the call is finished your phone switches back again. All that switching, plus the need to search for a different signal each time, can give the battery a significant hit. As you don\u2019t have to switch to 3G when making a call with VoLTE, that means you can also keep using 4G for other functions on your phone while on a call. That\u2019s handy if you\u2019re multi-tasking. For example, browsing the web at the same time or downloading an app. 4G Calling also offers the ability to seamlessly move between that and Wi-Fi Calling, without the call cutting out, so if you move away from one signal type you can continue on the other. It\u2019s also theoretically possible to make video calls over 4G, much like a Skype call, except you\u2019d just use your mobile number and be able to use the regular dialler and call interface, so you can make and receive video calls from anyone else with VoLTE, rather than relying on separate accounts. In fact you may have noticed that Skype and other existing video call\u00a0services often seem to have superior audio quality to voice calls. That\u2019s because like VoLTE they use more data as part of a similarly named VoIP system, so you can expect your voice calls to sound more like Skype calls when using VoLTE, but they won\u2019t hit your battery life as much as Skype does. Not only could video calls become native to the dialler, but other Rich Communication Services (or RCS\u2019s) could as well, such as file transferring, real time language translation, and video voicemail, and there may be applications which haven\u2019t even been thought up yet. However, it\u2019s worth noting that many of these functions aren\u2019t currently widely supported by phones and mobile networks. VoLTE is not available everywhere on every network, or on every handset, so you may or may not be able to use VoLTE \u2013 we\u2019ve got more information on that below. But assuming you can use it the only real limitation is that it won\u2019t work when abroad. All the major UK operators offer\u00a0VoLTE\u00a0along with\u00a0a few MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators). In order to take advantage of VoLTE you need to ensure your phone is compatible and that coverage is available (though VoLTE works in most of the same places as 4G), so we recommend checking on the links provided to make sure you will be able to take advantage of VoLTE (4G Calling). Assuming you have a compatible phone, the latest software from your network and are in an area with VoLTE on any of these networks you should have access to VoLTE \u2013 it may not be available on all plans though and the availability regularly changes, so if in doubt check with your network. UK Networks offering VoLTE Network Availability EE Check compatibility O2 Check compatibility Three Check compatibility Vodafone Check compatibility Asda Mobile iD Mobile Check compatibility BT Mobile Sky Mobile Smarty Mobile Virgin Mobile VOXI Three was\u00a0the first and network to offer VoLTE, through a service dubbed 4G\u00a0Super-Voice, which is available in all the same places as 4G. A large number of phones are compatible if bought direct from Three, including\u00a0the Samsung Galaxy S21 range, iPhone 12 range, Galaxy S20 range, iPhone 11 range, Huawei P40 Pro, Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite, OnePlus Nord, and many more. You can see an up to date list on Three\u2019s site, using the \u20184G Super-Voice\u2019 filter on the phones page. EE has a VoLTE service called 4G Calling, which is available everywhere on EE\u2019s 4G network. The service is only available on certain phones (and the selection is even more limited if you didn\u2019t buy direct from EE), but many of the latest and most high-profile handsets are supported.\u00a0 Vodafone also has a VoLTE service called 4G Calling, and it\u2019s available in the same places as its 4G network. The service works with most high-profile phones from Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and Sony, among some others, but with the exception of Apple phones you must have bought your handset from Vodafone for 4G Calling to work on its network. O2\u2019s VoLTE service is also called 4G Calling, and it\u2019s available in many cities across the UK, on a range of handsets from Apple, Samsung and Sony, plus a small number from OnePlus, Google and others. However as with most networks, some Android phones only work with it if bought direct from O2. Asda Mobile offers 4G Calling in the same places as Vodafone, and it should work on a wide range of handsets, though the network doesn\u2019t keep a list. iD Mobile offers VoLTE in the same locations as Three, so it\u2019s widely available. It works on a large number of devices, with a focus on recent Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Oppo, Motorola and Sony ones. BT Mobile offers 4G Calling in the same places as EE, so again, it\u2019s widely available, and it works with any iPhone from the iPhone 6 onwards, as well as a number of Android phones \u2013 though with Android you need to have bought your phone from BT. Sky Mobile uses O2\u2019s network for VoLTE (and everything else). It works on the original iPhone SE and iPhone 7 or later, the Samsung Galaxy S9 or later, a handful of other Samsung devices, and the Oppo A54 5G, Oppo Find X3 Lite 5G, and Oppo Find X3 Pro 5G. SMARTY Mobile offers 4G Calling in the same places as Three, and it\u2019s supported by the iPhone 6 range through to the iPhone 11 range, as well as the Samsung Galaxy S20 range and a number of handsets from other brands. Virgin Mobile\u2019s VoLTE service is available in the same places as Vodafone\u2019s and on a range of phones, including the iPhone 6 onwards, the Samsung Galaxy S10 and S20 ranges, the Huawei P40, and a selection of other Samsung phones. As with many networks, Virgin only guarantees it will work if you buy your phone direct from Virgin Mobile. VOXI offers VoLTE in the same places as Vodafone. The network doesn\u2019t keep a list of which phones support it, but we\u2019d expect many of the ones it sells will. If you\u2019re using a 3G handset then you\u2019ll definitely need to upgrade, but if you have a 4G enabled one (which almost all modern smartphones are) then it might work with VoLTE (though it may require a software update first). In theory most existing 4G phones should work with VoLTE, but some may encounter problems and as they all require a tailored software update it\u2019s dependent on each network to roll one out. So if you don\u2019t have a new and popular phone then you may be left waiting indefinitely. In practice, each network only currently supports VoLTE on a subset of phones, and in some cases only those bought directly from the network. Check the lists and links above for the full range of phones that are currently VoLTE-compatible on each network. The problem with Voice over LTE is that 4G LTE is a data-only networking technology, so it doesn\u2019t natively support voice calls. While 3G and 2G were primarily designed with voice calls in mind and data was added to them. As such it\u2019s been necessary to create new protocols to support voice calling over 4G and it\u2019s a big job, requiring upgrades across the entire voice call infrastructure. There\u2019s no one standard for this, with different networks creating their own solutions. There are some common problems and solutions though, most notably the requirement for Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC), which simply means that the phone will be able to switch back to a 2G or 3G signal if you move out of a 4G signal zone during the call. This needs to be seamless or the call will cut out, so it requires masts to pre-emptively deliver a 3G signal whenever the 4G signal drops dangerously low, but also to keep the 4G signal running at the same time, so it can either stay on 3G if it loses the 4G signal entirely or drop the 3G if the 4G signal becomes strengthened again. At the time of writing, 5G isn\u2019t used for calls, just as 4G didn\u2019t used to be (and still isn\u2019t in some cases). We\u2019d imagine that eventually call support will be added to the UK\u2019s 5G networks, especially as it is a use case that has been explored during the development of 5G, but there\u2019s no current indication of when that will happen \u2013 right now the focus of networks is understandably on increasing 5G coverage.

However, it is normal that we are not very clear about what specifically changes. Although, what we are clear about is that depending on whether we have one network or another, the Internet connection of our Android phone or iPhone is much faster. For this reason, it is time to see what each of these networks represent. In addition, it is also important to know all the frequency bands that current phones can take advantage of. Although, we will also talk about what technology has in store for us in the future, because in a while, it will be time to welcome 6G with open arms. For this reason, we encourage you to continue reading these lines and discover for yourself the differences between the connections that mobile phones can use.  Contents Surely, you have been able to verify that depending on the area in which your phone is located, use 3G, 4G\u2026 This will vary depending on the coverage provided by the different antennas that the operators have in our country. There are networks with their own networks at the national level: Movistar, Orange, Vodafone and Yoigo (Grupo M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil). Although, what matters to us on this occasion is knowing the different technologies that we can use in smartphones and how they differ from each other.  This second-generation technology was the first digital connection in phones. It is still possible to connect to this network, although it is difficult, since it will appear in remote areas, such as high mountain places or rural towns where the operator\u2019s antenna is far away. In this case, the Internet speed is lower , in addition to the fact that voice has preference over data, so these services cannot work at the same time on the phone. However, his arrival was around 1990, assuming an important change in mobile telephony. This technology greatly improved the security of communications, as it began to use encrypted digital protocols, especially the GMS (Global Mobile Communications System) standard . We cannot forget to mention that it has an upload and download of up to 9 Kbps. However, it is practically in disuse. This standard, known as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), is the natural evolution of the 2G bands . This network is transmitted digitally, as in the previous case. And in addition to allowing the use of the Internet on phones, it allows us to use SMS and MMS messages. It also increased the speed, being up to 80 Kbps down and 20 up. With a maximum speed of up to 236 Kbps downstream and 59 Kbps upstream, this is another evolution of the previous network. And it is not for less, since it was an important revelation in its time, since it was launched between 2003 and 2004. In addition, it is also part of the GMS family. In this case, we are facing a mobile connection that allows us higher transmission speeds than the previous ones. The third generation network began to expand since the year 2000. In this we find different types: HSPA and HSPA + . This was another of the biggest changes for mobile telephony, since we started to use the UMTS/HSPA antenna types, allowing us to increase the speed of the Internet connection. In this case, the base of the CS + PS core that was in the previous generation was kept. 3G technology moves at speeds of 384 Kbps upload and download. This standard comes from High-Speed Packet Access. Basically, we are facing an evolution of the 3G connection, which is why it is also called 3G+ or 3.5G . This technology can allow us a maximum speed of up to 14 Mbps. Its adoption by the smartphone sector began in 2010, making it easier to play videos on mobile and download movies, for example. The HSPA+ connection comes from Evolved High Speed Packet Access, although, as in the previous case, we are facing another evolution of the 3G network . This is the one that will offer us the best speeds with UMTS antennas. In addition, it is still fast today on smartphones, since it allows up to 84 Mbps download and 22 Mbps upload, so it is very close to what we can get with 4G connections.  The fourth generation came into our lives in 2013. In this way, we would not only make the connections more secure, but also have a greater capacity of the networks, since you get the fastest theoretical speeds (below 5G) in the smartphones, since it has 150 Mbps and 50 Mbps upload. The protocol used was called LTE (Long Term Evolution), it is capable of sending IP voice, SMS and data. Although, traditional voice calls continued to work over 3G networks. Why? More than anything because few operators have implemented voice over LTE. However, LTE connections offer lower speeds than 4G would actually offer. This led to it not being categorized as a fourth generation smartphone technology. For this reason, we began to enjoy the arrival of 4G + (also called Advanced LTE)\u00a0 from 2018. Although the massive implementation of the 5G mobile Internet network\u00a0has not yet been achieved, this technology began to arrive in 2020. The term comes from the acronym for 5th Generation, indicating the set of mobile phone technologies. This uses the new protocol that has been called New Radio, in addition to using the NGCN core (Next Generation Core Network).  Thanks to its innovative technology, it allows you to connect a large number of devices at the same time, in addition, mobile broadband has very high speed and capacity, since it has speeds greater than 10 Gbps and a latency of less than 1 ms. We are facing a connection that allows us to obtain a much faster data transmission than we have seen so far. Everything indicates that the key technologies for 6G mobile communication networks to be available will start in 2023. Although scientists point out that the sixth generation of emerging connections will begin in 2030. Compared to 5G, this new sixth-generation technology would be capable of increasing data speeds up to 100 times. What does this imply? Basically, it supposes a Terabyte per second, or even more, being possible the adhesion of next-generation intelligent devices, such as the case of high-performance computers. It is for this very reason that, in order to be able to move this enormous amount of data, 6G networks will have to personalize the future of the services they provide with the aim of fully satisfying the demands that are required of them in terms of the transmission of data by us, since we will act as users.  Among the characteristics that have been pointed out by scientists who have closely studied sixth-generation networks, we find the following aspects: Depending on your needs, it may be enough with one type of network or another , therefore, it is interesting that first you have been able to know which are all the ones that have been happening in the terminals. However, the fact that we can use one or the other will not only depend on the connections offered by each of the companies in your area, but also on the places you are going to visit or the rate you have contracted. For example, for 3G or 4G it is not necessary to contract anything special, but, on the other hand, if we want to use fifth generation technology, we must contact our operator to obtain a rate that includes the use of mobile data through this network. For this reason, we will always recommend you to take a look at a map with the network coverage. So you can take a quick look if where we are going to live, work or study has the best connection through the mobile connection. Thus, not only will you be able to make the best decision in the selection, but you will also know what interests you about it. Although, we can also choose from our phone what we want to have or what is the priority of the network that interests us, whether it is an Android smartphone or an iPhone. For this reason, we advise you to prioritize the current and fastest networks as long as you live in an area where there is coverage and your mobile is compatible.  In Android , the steps that we must follow to prioritize one connection or another are the following: In Apple phones, we find that as of iPhone 12, 5G is already available. In any case, to know which network we can choose, we must follow these steps: Therefore, by following these steps we can choose at all times the speed that we prefer on our phone when we are going to connect mobile data . However, you must bear in mind that these steps will vary depending on the smartphone we have or the customization layer. Although, in general, they all allow us to choose between the previous options that we have given you. Of course, keep in mind that depending on the option you choose, your mobile may spend more or less battery. Basically, because if you choose to only accept 4G, it will always be looking for the best connection at all times, so it will be better to set more options so that it switches automatically and does not consume more energy. The frequencies that we can find underwent a complete change and restructuring after the arrival of the national plan that changed DTT with the aim of making way for 5G. In it, we can also find the forgotten 2G, in addition to the expansion of 4G that tries to offer a stable connection throughout the national territory.  As we will be able to see below, each of the bands is destined for a spectrum, so if we do not have any of the frequency bands, we will lose capacities. For the same reason, the following frequency bands are necessary for mobile phones.

It's easy to find yourself in a situation where you have a lot of natural light but not enough to get a shutter speed fast enough to actually freeze any motion in your subject. When using flash you can combine them to get the best of both worlds \u2013 an image with some motion in it and a sharp subject. To do this you need to set your camera to rear-curtain flash, as it will not be configured to do this ordinarily. Most Nikon D-SLRs have different flash modes which work with both the pop-up flash and Nikon Speedlights. The standard mode for the flash set-up is front curtain, denoted by the flash or lighting symbol on the display. While this is great for using your flash to freeze the subject and add light as fill flash, it won't convey any feeling of motion in your image if you use a normal shutter speed of around 1/60-1/100sec. In front-curtain mode the camera fires the flash at the beginning of the exposure and, if you are working with a faster shutter speed, the flash light appears instantaneously as you press the shutter on the camera. If you set up your camera with a slow shutter speed and front-curtain flash, as described above, the flash will fire at the start of the exposure and capture the motion of the long exposure with the slow shutter speed. This gives you an interesting image, but potentially an odd and unnatural looking one, where the motion appears in front of the frozen subject. Rear-curtain flash or rear-curtain sync is the opposite of front-curtain flash, with the flash burst firing at the end of the exposure. If you're using a fast shutter speed on your camera you won't notice any difference between the front and rear-flash setting. It only starts to make a difference when you use a slow shutter speed in conjunction with rear-curtain flash. One of the best ways to use rear-curtain flash is in when you have a low-light scene. You need some ambient light to help you capture the motion in the image, and the more ambient light you have, the better the motion trail is going to show up. You can shoot rear-curtain flash images handheld, but you do run the risk of camera shake as well as the motion blur you are trying to capture \u2013 remember that you are intentionally using slow shutter speeds, so for best results use a tripod. To set rear-curtain flash with the in-camera flash, pop the flash up and then hold down the flash button on the camera and rotate the rear command dial until it shows REAR on the camera's back LCD or top display. If you are using a Speedlight (which will give superior results to the pop-up flash), mount it on the camera's hotshoe, then press the flash button on the side of the camera and rotate the rear command dial until it shows REAR on the camera's back LCD or top display. For your camera settings, shoot in aperture/shutter priority or, if you are comfortable using it, manual mode, which will give maximum control over the light in the scene. Using rear-curtain flash is not a precise science; it will require a little bit of experimentation on your part to decide how much motion you want in the scene. You could start with an aperture of f/5.6, a shutter speed of 1sec and an ISO of 200 and then adjust accordingly, depending on the light you are working in and the motion you want to capture. Put your Speedlight or pop-up flash onto TTL and use flash-exposure compensation to fine-tune the output of the flash accordingly. Now take a few images as a reference point to gauge the motion in the image. If you want longer trails, make your shutter speed slower i.e. from 1-4sec; if you want the movement to be shorter, go for a faster shutter speed i.e. 1sec to 1/10sec. Your first attempts at rear-curtain flash might look a bit odd, as images taken with this technique will not always produce the results you expect. You don't always get a perfectly frozen subject, and sometimes you may have a double image of your subject depending on the combination of settings you've used and the ambient light you are shooting with. But persevere and, with practice, you'll get some great results. Learn more about how to control and manipulate light in our inspiring and creative flash courses!

Sensor event values from many sensors are expressed in a specific frame that\nis static relative to the device.\n\nMobile device axes\nThe Sensor API is relative only to the natural orientation of the screen\n(axes aren't swapped when the device's screen orientation changes.\n\nFigure 1. Coordinate system (relative to\na mobile device) used by the Sensor API\nAutomotive axes\nIn Android Automotive implementations, axes are defined with respect to the vehicle body frame.\nThe origin of the vehicle reference frame is the center of the rear axle. The vehicle reference\nframe is oriented so that the:\n\nX-axis points to the right and is on a horizontal plane, perpendicular to the vehicle plane\n    of symmetry.\nY-axis points forward and is on a horizontal plane.\n\n\nFigure 2. Coordinate system (relative to\nan automotive device) used by the Sensor API\nThe vehicle reference frame is a right-handed coordinate system. Therefore, the Z-axis\n  points up.\nThe Z-axis of the reference frame is aligned to gravity, which means that the X-axis and Y-axis\nare both horizontal. As a result, the Y-axis may not always go through the front axle.\n\nBase sensors\nBase sensor types are named after the physical sensors they represent. These\nsensors relay data from a single physical sensor (as opposed to composite\nsensors that generate data out of other sensors). Examples of base sensor types\ninclude:\n\nSENSOR_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER\nSENSOR_TYPE_GYROSCOPE\nSENSOR_TYPE_MAGNETOMETER\n\nNote: For details on each Android sensor\ntype, review the following sections.\nHowever, base sensors aren't equal to and shouldn't be confused with their\nunderlying physical sensor. The data from a base sensor is not\nthe raw output of the physical sensor because corrections (such as bias\ncompensation and temperature compensation) are applied.\nFor example, the characteristics of a base sensor might be different from the\ncharacteristics of its underlying physical sensor in the following use cases:\n\nA gyroscope chip rated to have a bias range of 1\u00a0deg/sec.\n  \nAfter factory calibration, temperature compensation and bias\n      compensation are applied, the actual bias of the Android sensor will be\n      reduced, may be to a\n      point where the bias is guaranteed to be below 0.01\u00a0deg/sec.\nIn this situation, we say that the Android sensor has a bias below\n      0.01\u00a0deg/sec, even though the data sheet of the underlying sensor\n      said 1\u00a0deg/sec.\n\n\nA barometer with a power consumption of 100\u00a0uW.\n  \nBecause the generated data needs to be transported from the chip to the\n      SoC, the actual power cost to gather data from the barometer Android\n      sensor might be much higher, for example 1000\u00a0uW.\nIn this situation, we say that the Android sensor has a power\n      consumption of 1000\u00a0uW, even though the power consumption measured at\n      the barometer chip leads is 100uW.\n\n\nA magnetometer that consumes 100uW when calibrated, but consumes more when\ncalibrating.\n  \nIts calibration routine might require activating the gyroscope,\n      consuming 5000\u00a0uW, and running some algorithm, costing another\n      900\u00a0uW.\nIn this situation, we say that the maximum power consumption of the\n      (magnetometer) Android sensor is 6000\u00a0uW.\nIn this case, the average power consumption is the more useful measure,\n      and it's what is reported in the sensor static characteristics through\n      the HAL.\n\n\n\nAccelerometer\nReporting-mode: \n  Continuous\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nAn accelerometer sensor reports the acceleration of the device along the\n  three sensor axes. The measured acceleration includes both the physical\n  acceleration\n  (change of velocity) and the gravity. The measurement is reported in the x, y,\n  and z fields of sensors_event_t.acceleration.\nAll values are in SI units (m/s^2) and measure the acceleration of the device\n  minus the force of gravity along the three sensor axes.\nHere are examples:\n\n The norm of (x, y, z) should be close to 0 when in free fall. \n When the device lies flat on a table and is pushed on its left side\n    toward the right, the x acceleration value is positive. \n When the device lies flat on a table, the acceleration value along z is\n    +9.81 alo, which corresponds to the acceleration of the device\n    (0\u00a0m/s^2) minus the force of gravity (-9.81\u00a0m/s^2). \n When the device lies flat on a table and is pushed toward the sky, the\n    acceleration value is greater than +9.81, which corresponds to the\n    acceleration\n    of the device (+A\u00a0m/s^2) minus the force of gravity (-9.81\u00a0m/s^2). \n\nThe readings are calibrated using:\n\nTemperature compensation \nOnline bias calibration \nOnline scale calibration \n\nThe bias and scale calibration must only be updated while the sensor is\n  deactivated, so as to avoid causing jumps in values during streaming.\nThe accelerometer also reports how accurate it expects its readings to be\n  through sensors_event_t.acceleration.status. See the \nSensorManager\u2019s\n  \nSENSOR_STATUS_* constants for more information on possible\n  values for this field.\nAmbient temperature\nReporting-mode: On-change\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nThis sensor provides the ambient (room) temperature in degrees Celsius.\nMagnetic field sensor\nReporting-mode: \n  Continuous\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nSENSOR_TYPE_GEOMAGNETIC_FIELD == SENSOR_TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD\nA magnetic field sensor (also known as magnetometer) reports the ambient\n  magnetic field, as measured along the three sensor axes.\nThe measurement is reported in the x, y, and z fields of\n  sensors_event_t.magnetic and all values are in micro-Tesla (uT).\nThe magnetometer also reports how accurate it expects its readings to be\n  through sensors_event_t.magnetic.status. See the \nSensorManager\u2019s\n\nSENSOR_STATUS_* constants for more information on possible\n  values for this field.\nThe readings are calibrated using:\n\nTemperature compensation \nFactory (or online) soft-iron calibration \nOnline hard-iron calibration \n\nGyroscope\nReporting-mode: \n  Continuous\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_GYROSCOPE)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nA gyroscope sensor reports the rate of rotation of the device around the\n  three sensor axes.\nRotation is positive in the counterclockwise direction (right-hand rule).\n  That is, an observer looking from some positive location on the x, y, or z\n  axis at a device positioned on the origin would report positive rotation if\n  the device appeared to be rotating counter clockwise. Note that this is the\n  standard mathematical definition of positive rotation and does not agree\n  with the aerospace definition of roll.\nThe measurement is reported in the x, y, and z fields of\n  sensors_event_t.gyro\n  and all values are in radians per second (rad/s).\nThe readings are calibrated using:\n\nTemperature compensation \nFactory (or online) scale compensation \nOnline bias calibration (to remove drift) \n\nThe gyroscope also reports how accurate it expects its readings to be through\n  sensors_event_t.gyro.status. See the \nSensorManager\u2019s\n  \nSENSOR_STATUS_* constants for more information on possible\n  values for this field.\nThe gyroscope can't be emulated based on magnetometers and accelerometers, as\n  this would cause it to have reduced local consistency and responsiveness. It\n  must be based on a usual gyroscope chip.\nHeart Rate\nReporting-mode: On-change\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_HEART_RATE)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nA heart rate sensor reports the current heart rate of the person touching the\n  device.\nThe current heart rate in beats per minute (BPM) is reported in\n  sensors_event_t.heart_rate.bpm and the status of the sensor is\n  reported in\n  sensors_event_t.heart_rate.status. See the \nSensorManager\u2019s\n  \nSENSOR_STATUS_* constants for more information on possible\n  values for this field. In\n  particular, upon the first activation, unless the device is known to not be on\n  the body, the status field of the first event must be set to\n  SENSOR_STATUS_UNRELIABLE. Because this sensor is on-change,\n  events are generated when and only when heart_rate.bpm or\n  heart_rate.status have changed since the last event. The events\n  are generated no faster than every sampling_period.\nsensor_t.requiredPermission is always\n  SENSOR_PERMISSION_BODY_SENSORS.\nLight\nReporting-mode: \n  On-change\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_LIGHT)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nA light sensor reports the current illumination in SI lux units.\nThe measurement is reported in sensors_event_t.light.\nProximity\nReporting-mode: \n  On-change\nUsually defined as a wake-up sensor\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_PROXIMITY)\nreturns a wake-up sensor\nA proximity sensor reports the distance from the sensor to the closest visible\n  surface.\nUp to Android 4.4, the proximity sensors were always wake-up sensors, waking\n  up the SoC when detecting a change in proximity. After Android 4.4, we\n  advise to implement the wake-up version of this sensor first, as it's the one\n  that is used to turn the screen on and off while making phone calls.\nThe measurement is reported in centimeters in\n  sensors_event_t.distance. Note\n  that some proximity sensors only support a binary \"near\"\n  or \"far\" measurement.\n  In this case, the sensor report its sensor_t.maxRange\n  value in the \"far\" state\n  and a value less than sensor_t.maxRange in the\n  \"near\" state.\nPressure\nReporting-mode: \n  Continuous\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_PRESSURE)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nA pressure sensor (also known as barometer) reports the atmospheric pressure\n  in hectopascal (hPa).\nThe readings are calibrated using\n\nTemperature compensation\nFactory bias calibration\nFactory scale calibration\n\nThe barometer is often used to estimate elevation changes.\n  To estimate absolute\n  elevation, the sea-level pressure (changing depending on the weather) must be\n  used as a reference.\nRelative humidity\nReporting-mode: \n  On-change\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_RELATIVE_HUMIDITY)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nA relative humidity sensor measures relative ambient air humidity and\n  returns a value in percent.\nComposite sensor types\nA composite sensor generates data by processing and/or fusing data from one\nor several physical sensors. (Any sensor that isn't a base sensor is called a\ncomposite sensor.) Examples of composite sensors include:\n\nStep detector and\nsignificant motion, which are usually based on\nan accelerometer, but could be based on other sensors as well, if the power\nconsumption and accuracy was acceptable.\nGame rotation vector, based on an\naccelerometer and a gyroscope.\nUncalibrated gyroscope, which is\nsimilar to the gyroscope base sensor, but with the bias calibration being\nreported separately instead of being corrected in the measurement.\n\nAs with base sensors, the characteristics of the composite sensors come from\nthe characteristics of their final data. For example, the power consumption of a\ngame rotation vector is probably equal to the sum of the power consumptions of\nthe accelerometer chip, the gyroscope chip, the chip processing the data, and\nthe buses transporting the data. As another example, the drift of a game\nrotation vector depends as much on the quality of the calibration algorithm as\non the physical sensor characteristics.\nThe following table lists available composite sensor types. Each composite\nsensor relies on data from one or several physical sensors. Avoid choosing other\nunderlying physical sensors to approximate results as they provide a poor user\nexperience.\nNote: When there is no gyroscope on the\ndevice (and only when there is no gyroscope), you may implement the rotation\nvector, linear acceleration, and gravity sensors without using the gyroscope.\n\n\nSensor type\nCategory\nUnderlying physical sensors\nReporting mode\n\n\nGame rotation vector\nAttitude\nAccelerometer, gyroscope, MUST NOT USE magnetometer\nContinuous\n\n\nGeomagnetic rotation\n     vector \nAttitude\nAccelerometer, magnetometer, MUST NOT USE gyroscope\nContinuous\n\n\nGlance gesture \nInteraction\nUndefined\nOne-shot\n\n\nGravity\nAttitude\nAccelerometer, gyroscope\nContinuous\n\n\nGyroscope uncalibrated\nUncalibrated\nGyroscope\nContinuous\n\n\nLinear acceleration\nActivity\nAccelerometer, gyroscope (if present), or magnetometer\n      (if gyro not present)\nContinuous\n\n\nMagnetic field uncalibrated\nUncalibrated\nMagnetometer\nContinuous\n\n\nOrientation (deprecated)\nAttitude\nAccelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope (if present)\nContinuous\n\n\nPick up gesture \nInteraction\nUndefined\nOne-shot\n\n\nRotation vector\nAttitude\nAccelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope\nContinuous\n\n\nSignificant motion \nActivity\nAccelerometer (or another as long as very low power)\nOne-shot\n\n\nStep counter \nActivity\nAccelerometer\nOn-change\n\n\nStep detector  Activity\nAccelerometer\nSpecial\n\n\nTilt detector \nActivity\nAccelerometer\nSpecial\n\n\nWake up gesture \nInteraction\nUndefined\nOne-shot\n\n\n\n  = Low power sensor\nActivity composite sensors\nLinear acceleration\nUnderlying physical sensors:  Accelerometer and (if present) gyroscope (or\n  magnetometer if gyroscope not present)\nReporting-mode: Continuous\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nA linear acceleration sensor reports the linear acceleration of the device in\n  the sensor frame, not including gravity.\nThe output is conceptually: output of the accelerometer minus the output of the gravity sensor. It's reported in m/s^2 in the x, y, and z\n  fields of sensors_event_t.acceleration.\nReadings on all axes should be close to 0 when the device is immobile.\nIf the device possesses a gyroscope, the linear acceleration sensor must use\n  the gyroscope and accelerometer as input.\nIf the device doesn\u2019t possess a gyroscope, the linear acceleration sensor\n  must use the accelerometer and the magnetometer as input.\nSignificant motion\nUnderlying physical sensor: Accelerometer (or another as long as low power)\nReporting-mode: One-shot\nLow power\nImplement only the wake-up version of this sensor.\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_SIGNIFICANT_MOTION)\nreturns a wake-up sensor\nA significant motion detector triggers when detecting a significant\n  motion: a motion that might lead to a change in the user location.\nExamples of such significant motions are:\n\nWalking or biking \nSitting in a moving car, coach, or train \n\nExamples of situations that don't trigger significant motion:\n\nPhone in pocket and person isn't moving\nPhone is on a table and the table shakes a bit due to nearby\n    traffic or washing machine\n\nAt the high level, the significant motion detector is used to reduce the\n  power consumption of location determination. When the localization algorithms\n  detect that the device is static, they can switch to a low-power mode,\n  where they rely on significant motion to wake the device up when the user\n  is changing location.\nThis sensor must be low power. It makes a tradeoff for power consumption that\n  may result in a small amount of false negatives. This is done for a few\n  reasons:\n\nThe goal of this sensor is to save power.\nTriggering an event when the user isn't moving (false positive) is\n    costly in terms of power, so it should be avoided.\nNot triggering an event when the user is moving (false negative) is\n    acceptable as long as it isn't done repeatedly. If the user has been\n    walking for 10 seconds, not triggering an event within those\n    10 seconds isn't acceptable.\n\nEach sensor event reports 1 in sensors_event_t.data[0].\nStep detector\nUnderlying physical sensor: Accelerometer (+ possibly others as long as low\n  power)\nReporting-mode: Special\n  (one event per step taken)\nLow power\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_STEP_DETECTOR)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nA step detector generates an event each time a step is taken by the user.\nThe timestamp of the event sensors_event_t.timestamp corresponds\n  to when the foot hit the ground, generating a high variation in acceleration.\nCompared to the step counter, the step detector should have a lower latency\n  (less than two seconds). Both the step detector and the step counter detect\n  when the user is walking, running, and walking up the stairs. They shouldn't\n  trigger when the user is biking, driving, or in other vehicles.\nThis sensor must be low power. That is, if the step detection cannot be done\n  in hardware, this sensor shouldn't be defined. In particular, when the step\n  detector is activated and the accelerometer isn't, only steps should trigger\n  interrupts (not every accelerometer reading).\nsampling_period_ns has no impact on step detectors.\nEach sensor event reports 1 in sensors_event_t.data[0].\nStep counter\nUnderlying physical sensor: Accelerometer (+ possibly others as long as low\n  power)\nReporting-mode: \n  On-change\nLow-power\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_STEP_COUNTER)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nA step counter reports the number of steps taken by the user since the last\n  reboot while activated.\nThe measurement is reported as a uint64_t in\n  sensors_event_t.step_counter and\n  is reset to zero only on a system reboot.\nThe timestamp of the event is set to the time when the last step for that\n  event was taken.\nSee the Step detector sensor type for the\n  signification of the time of a step.\nCompared to the step detector, the step counter can have a higher latency (up\n  to 10 seconds). Thanks to this latency, this sensor has a high accuracy; the\n  step count after a full day of measures should be within 10% of the actual\n  step count. Both the step detector and the step counter detect when the user\n  is walking, running, and walking up the stairs. They shouldn't trigger when\n  the user is biking, driving, or in other vehicles.\nThe hardware must ensure the internal step count never overflows. The minimum\n  size of the hardware's internal counter shall be 16 bits. In case of imminent\n  overflow (at most every ~2^16 steps), the SoC can be woken up so the driver\n  can do the counter maintenance.\nAs stated in Interaction, while\n  this sensor operates, it shall not disrupt any other sensors, in particular,\n  the accelerometer, which might very well be in use.\nIf a particular device can't support these modes of operation, then this\n  sensor type must not be reported by the HAL. That is, it isn't acceptable to\n  \"emulate\" this sensor in the HAL.\nThis sensor must be low power. That is, if the step detection can't be done\n  in hardware, this sensor shouldn't be defined. In particular, when the step\n  counter is activated and the accelerometer isn't, only steps should trigger\n  interrupts (not accelerometer data).\nTilt detector\nUnderlying physical sensor: Accelerometer (+ possibly others as long as low\n  power)\nReporting-mode: Special\nLow-power\nImplement only the wake-up version of this sensor.\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_TILT_DETECTOR)\nreturns a wake-up sensor\nA tilt detector generates an event each time a tilt event is detected.\nA tilt event is defined by the direction of the 2-seconds window average\n  gravity changing by at least 35 degrees since the activation or the last event\n  generated by the sensor. Here is the algorithm:\n\nreference_estimated_gravity = average of\n    accelerometer measurements over the\n    first second after activation or the estimated\n    gravity when the last tilt event was generated. \ncurrent_estimated_gravity = average of accelerometer\n    measurements over the last 2 seconds. \nTrigger when\n    angle(reference_estimated_gravity, current_estimated_gravity) > 35\n    degrees\n\nLarge accelerations without a change in phone orientation shouldn't trigger a\n  tilt event. For example, a sharp turn or strong acceleration while driving a\n  car shouldn't trigger a tilt event, even though the angle of the average\n  acceleration might vary by more than 35 degrees.\n  Typically, this sensor is\n  implemented with the help of only an accelerometer. Other sensors can be used\n  as well if they do not increase the power consumption significantly. This is a\n  low-power sensor that should allow the SoC to go into suspend mode. Do not\n  emulate this sensor in the HAL. Each sensor event reports 1 in\n  sensors_event_t.data[0].\nAttitude composite sensors\nRotation vector\nUnderlying physical sensors: Accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope\nReporting-mode: Continuous\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR) returns a\n  non-wake-up sensor\nA rotation vector sensor reports the orientation of the device relative to\n  the East-North-Up coordinates frame. It's usually obtained by integration of\n  accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings. The East-North-Up\n  coordinate system is defined as a direct orthonormal basis where:\n\nX points east and is tangential to the ground.\nY points north and is tangential to the ground.\nZ points towards the sky and is perpendicular to the ground.\n\nThe orientation of the phone is represented by the rotation necessary to\n  align the East-North-Up coordinates with the phone's coordinates. That is,\n  applying the rotation to the world frame (X,Y,Z) would align them with the\n  phone coordinates (x,y,z).\nThe rotation can be seen as rotating the phone by an angle theta around an\n  axis rot_axis to go from the reference (East-North-Up aligned)\n  device orientation to\n  the current device orientation. The rotation is encoded as the four unit-less\n  x, y, z, w components of a unit quaternion:\n\nsensors_event_t.data[0] = rot_axis.x*sin(theta/2) \nsensors_event_t.data[1] = rot_axis.y*sin(theta/2) \nsensors_event_t.data[2] = rot_axis.z*sin(theta/2) \nsensors_event_t.data[3] = cos(theta/2) \n\nWhere:\n\nThe  x, y, and z fields of rot_axis are the East-North-Up\n  coordinates of a unit length vector representing the rotation axis\ntheta is the rotation angle\n\nThe quaternion is a unit quaternion: It must be of norm 1.\n  Failure to ensure\n  this will cause erratic client behavior.\nIn addition, this sensor reports an estimated heading accuracy:\nsensors_event_t.data[4] = estimated_accuracy (in radians)\nThe heading error must be less than estimated_accuracy 95% of\nthe time. This sensor must use a gyroscope as the main orientation change input.\nThis sensor also uses accelerometer and magnetometer input to make up\n  for gyroscope drift, and it can't be implemented using only the accelerometer\n  and magnetometer.\nGame rotation vector\nUnderlying physical sensors: Accelerometer and gyroscope (no magnetometer)\nReporting-mode: Continuous\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nA game rotation vector sensor is similar to a rotation vector sensor but not\n  using the geomagnetic field. Therefore the Y axis doesn't point north but\n  instead to some other reference. That reference is allowed to drift by the\n  same order of magnitude as the gyroscope drifts around the Z axis.\nSee the Rotation vector sensor for details on\n  how to set sensors_event_t.data[0-3]. This sensor doesn't\n  report an estimated heading accuracy:\n  sensors_event_t.data[4] is reserved and should be set to 0.\nIn an ideal case, a phone rotated and returned to the same real-world\n  orientation should report the same game rotation vector.\nThis sensor must be based on a gyroscope and an accelerometer. It can't use\n  magnetometer as an input, besides, indirectly, through estimation of the\n  gyroscope bias.\nGravity\nUnderlying physical sensors: Accelerometer and (if present) gyroscope (or\n  magnetometer if gyroscope not present)\nReporting-mode: Continuous\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_GRAVITY)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nA gravity sensor reports the direction and magnitude of gravity in the\n  device's coordinates.\nThe gravity vector components are reported in m/s^2 in the x, y, and z\n  fields of sensors_event_t.acceleration.\nWhen the device is at rest, the output of the gravity sensor should be\n  identical to that of the accelerometer. On Earth, the magnitude is around\n  9.8\u00a0m/s^2.\nIf the device possesses a gyroscope, the gravity sensor must use the\n  gyroscope and accelerometer as input.\nIf the device doesn\u2019t possess a gyroscope, the gravity sensor must use the\n  accelerometer and the magnetometer as input.\nGeomagnetic rotation vector\nUnderlying physical sensors: Accelerometer and magnetometer (no gyroscope)\nReporting-mode: Continuous\nLow-power\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_GEOMAGNETIC_ROTATION_VECTOR)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nA geomagnetic rotation vector is similar to a rotation vector sensor but\n  using a magnetometer and no gyroscope.\nThis sensor must be based on a magnetometer. It can't be implemented using a\n  gyroscope, and gyroscope input can't be used by this sensor.\nSee the Rotation vector sensor for details on\n  how to set sensors_event_t.data[0-4].\nJust like for the rotation vector sensor, the heading error must be less than\n  the estimated accuracy (sensors_event_t.data[4]) 95% of the time.\nThis sensor must be low power, so it has to be implemented in hardware.\nOrientation (deprecated)\nUnderlying physical sensors: Accelerometer, magnetometer and (if present)\n  gyroscope\nReporting-mode: Continuous\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_ORIENTATION)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nNote: This is an older sensor type that has\n  been deprecated in the Android SDK.\n  It has been replaced by the rotation vector sensor, which is more clearly\n  defined. Use the rotation vector sensor over the orientation sensor whenever\n  possible.\nAn orientation sensor reports the attitude of the device.

Standard IMU types in Android (such as\n  \nSENSOR_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER\n  and \nSENSOR_TYPE_GYROSCOPE)\n  assume that all three axes are supported. However, not all form factors and\n  devices support 3-axis accelerometers and 3-axis gyroscopes.\nAccelerometer limited axes\nUnderlying physical sensors: Accelerometer\nReporting-mode: Continuous\ngetDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER_LIMITED_AXES)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor\nAn accelerometer limited axes sensor is equivalent to\n  TYPE_ACCELEROMETER but supports cases where one or two axes\n  aren't supported.\nThe last three sensor event values reported by the sensor represent whether\n  the acceleration value for the x, y, and z axes are supported.

The heading sensor includes two SensorEvent values.\n  One for the measured device heading and one for the accuracy of the provided\n  heading value.\nHeading values reported by this sensor must be between\n  0.0 (inclusive) and 360.0 (exclusive), with\n  0 indicating north, 90 east, 180 south,\n  and 270 west.\nAccuracy for this sensor is defined at 68 percent confidence. In the case\n  where the underlying distribution is Gaussian normal, the accuracy is one\n  standard deviation. For example, if the heading sensor returns a heading value\n  of 60 degrees and an accuracy value of 10 degrees, there's a 68 percent\n  probability of the true heading being between 50 degrees and 70 degrees.\n\n The Sensor API is relative only to the natural orientation of the screen\n(axes aren't swapped when the device's screen orientation changes. Figure 1. Coordinate system (relative to\na mobile device) used by the Sensor API In Android Automotive implementations, axes are defined with respect to the vehicle body frame.\nThe origin of the vehicle reference frame is the center of the rear axle. The vehicle reference\nframe is oriented so that the: Figure 2. Coordinate system (relative to\nan automotive device) used by the Sensor API The vehicle reference frame is a right-handed coordinate system. Therefore, the Z-axis\n  points up. The Z-axis of the reference frame is aligned to gravity, which means that the X-axis and Y-axis\nare both horizontal. As a result, the Y-axis may not always go through the front axle.\n Base sensor types are named after the physical sensors they represent. These\nsensors relay data from a single physical sensor (as opposed to composite\nsensors that generate data out of other sensors). Examples of base sensor types\ninclude: However, base sensors aren't equal to and shouldn't be confused with their\nunderlying physical sensor. The data from a base sensor is not\nthe raw output of the physical sensor because corrections (such as bias\ncompensation and temperature compensation) are applied. For example, the characteristics of a base sensor might be different from the\ncharacteristics of its underlying physical sensor in the following use cases: Reporting-mode: \n  Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor An accelerometer sensor reports the acceleration of the device along the\n  three sensor axes. The measured acceleration includes both the physical\n  acceleration\n  (change of velocity) and the gravity. The measurement is reported in the x, y,\n  and z fields of sensors_event_t.acceleration. All values are in SI units (m/s^2) and measure the acceleration of the device\n  minus the force of gravity along the three sensor axes. Here are examples: The readings are calibrated using: The bias and scale calibration must only be updated while the sensor is\n  deactivated, so as to avoid causing jumps in values during streaming. The accelerometer also reports how accurate it expects its readings to be\n  through sensors_event_t.acceleration.status. See the \nSensorManager\u2019s\n  \nSENSOR_STATUS_* constants for more information on possible\n  values for this field. Reporting-mode: On-change getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor This sensor provides the ambient (room) temperature in degrees Celsius. Reporting-mode: \n  Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor SENSOR_TYPE_GEOMAGNETIC_FIELD == SENSOR_TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD A magnetic field sensor (also known as magnetometer) reports the ambient\n  magnetic field, as measured along the three sensor axes. The measurement is reported in the x, y, and z fields of\n  sensors_event_t.magnetic and all values are in micro-Tesla (uT). The magnetometer also reports how accurate it expects its readings to be\n  through sensors_event_t.magnetic.status. See the \nSensorManager\u2019s\n\nSENSOR_STATUS_* constants for more information on possible\n  values for this field. The readings are calibrated using: Reporting-mode: \n  Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_GYROSCOPE)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor A gyroscope sensor reports the rate of rotation of the device around the\n  three sensor axes. Rotation is positive in the counterclockwise direction (right-hand rule).\n  That is, an observer looking from some positive location on the x, y, or z\n  axis at a device positioned on the origin would report positive rotation if\n  the device appeared to be rotating counter clockwise. Note that this is the\n  standard mathematical definition of positive rotation and does not agree\n  with the aerospace definition of roll. The measurement is reported in the x, y, and z fields of\n  sensors_event_t.gyro\n  and all values are in radians per second (rad/s). The readings are calibrated using: The gyroscope also reports how accurate it expects its readings to be through\n  sensors_event_t.gyro.status. See the \nSensorManager\u2019s\n  \nSENSOR_STATUS_* constants for more information on possible\n  values for this field. The gyroscope can't be emulated based on magnetometers and accelerometers, as\n  this would cause it to have reduced local consistency and responsiveness. It\n  must be based on a usual gyroscope chip. Reporting-mode: On-change getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_HEART_RATE)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor A heart rate sensor reports the current heart rate of the person touching the\n  device. The current heart rate in beats per minute (BPM) is reported in\n  sensors_event_t.heart_rate.bpm and the status of the sensor is\n  reported in\n  sensors_event_t.heart_rate.status. See the \nSensorManager\u2019s\n  \nSENSOR_STATUS_* constants for more information on possible\n  values for this field. In\n  particular, upon the first activation, unless the device is known to not be on\n  the body, the status field of the first event must be set to\n  SENSOR_STATUS_UNRELIABLE. Because this sensor is on-change,\n  events are generated when and only when heart_rate.bpm or\n  heart_rate.status have changed since the last event. The events\n  are generated no faster than every sampling_period. sensor_t.requiredPermission is always\n  SENSOR_PERMISSION_BODY_SENSORS. Reporting-mode: \n  On-change getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_LIGHT)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor A light sensor reports the current illumination in SI lux units. The measurement is reported in sensors_event_t.light. Reporting-mode: \n  On-change Usually defined as a wake-up sensor getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_PROXIMITY)\nreturns a wake-up sensor A proximity sensor reports the distance from the sensor to the closest visible\n  surface. Up to Android 4.4, the proximity sensors were always wake-up sensors, waking\n  up the SoC when detecting a change in proximity. After Android 4.4, we\n  advise to implement the wake-up version of this sensor first, as it's the one\n  that is used to turn the screen on and off while making phone calls. The measurement is reported in centimeters in\n  sensors_event_t.distance. Note\n  that some proximity sensors only support a binary \"near\"\n  or \"far\" measurement.\n  In this case, the sensor report its sensor_t.maxRange\n  value in the \"far\" state\n  and a value less than sensor_t.maxRange in the\n  \"near\" state. Reporting-mode: \n  Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_PRESSURE)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor A pressure sensor (also known as barometer) reports the atmospheric pressure\n  in hectopascal (hPa). The readings are calibrated using The barometer is often used to estimate elevation changes.\n  To estimate absolute\n  elevation, the sea-level pressure (changing depending on the weather) must be\n  used as a reference. Reporting-mode: \n  On-change getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_RELATIVE_HUMIDITY)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor A relative humidity sensor measures relative ambient air humidity and\n  returns a value in percent. A composite sensor generates data by processing and/or fusing data from one\nor several physical sensors. (Any sensor that isn't a base sensor is called a\ncomposite sensor.) Examples of composite sensors include: As with base sensors, the characteristics of the composite sensors come from\nthe characteristics of their final data. For example, the power consumption of a\ngame rotation vector is probably equal to the sum of the power consumptions of\nthe accelerometer chip, the gyroscope chip, the chip processing the data, and\nthe buses transporting the data. As another example, the drift of a game\nrotation vector depends as much on the quality of the calibration algorithm as\non the physical sensor characteristics. The following table lists available composite sensor types. Each composite\nsensor relies on data from one or several physical sensors. Avoid choosing other\nunderlying physical sensors to approximate results as they provide a poor user\nexperience.

The output is conceptually: output of the accelerometer minus the output of the gravity sensor. It's reported in m/s^2 in the x, y, and z\n  fields of sensors_event_t.acceleration. Readings on all axes should be close to 0 when the device is immobile. If the device possesses a gyroscope, the linear acceleration sensor must use\n  the gyroscope and accelerometer as input. If the device doesn\u2019t possess a gyroscope, the linear acceleration sensor\n  must use the accelerometer and the magnetometer as input. Underlying physical sensor: Accelerometer (or another as long as low power) Reporting-mode: One-shot Low power Implement only the wake-up version of this sensor. getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_SIGNIFICANT_MOTION)\nreturns a wake-up sensor A significant motion detector triggers when detecting a significant\n  motion: a motion that might lead to a change in the user location. Examples of such significant motions are: Examples of situations that don't trigger significant motion: At the high level, the significant motion detector is used to reduce the\n  power consumption of location determination. When the localization algorithms\n  detect that the device is static, they can switch to a low-power mode,\n  where they rely on significant motion to wake the device up when the user\n  is changing location. This sensor must be low power. It makes a tradeoff for power consumption that\n  may result in a small amount of false negatives. This is done for a few\n  reasons: Each sensor event reports 1 in sensors_event_t.data[0]. Underlying physical sensor: Accelerometer (+ possibly others as long as low\n  power) Reporting-mode: Special\n  (one event per step taken) Low power getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_STEP_DETECTOR)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor A step detector generates an event each time a step is taken by the user. The timestamp of the event sensors_event_t.timestamp corresponds\n  to when the foot hit the ground, generating a high variation in acceleration. Compared to the step counter, the step detector should have a lower latency\n  (less than two seconds). Both the step detector and the step counter detect\n  when the user is walking, running, and walking up the stairs. They shouldn't\n  trigger when the user is biking, driving, or in other vehicles. This sensor must be low power. That is, if the step detection cannot be done\n  in hardware, this sensor shouldn't be defined. In particular, when the step\n  detector is activated and the accelerometer isn't, only steps should trigger\n  interrupts (not every accelerometer reading). sampling_period_ns has no impact on step detectors. Each sensor event reports 1 in sensors_event_t.data[0]. Underlying physical sensor: Accelerometer (+ possibly others as long as low\n  power) Reporting-mode: \n  On-change Low-power getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_STEP_COUNTER)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor A step counter reports the number of steps taken by the user since the last\n  reboot while activated. The measurement is reported as a uint64_t in\n  sensors_event_t.step_counter and\n  is reset to zero only on a system reboot. The timestamp of the event is set to the time when the last step for that\n  event was taken. See the Step detector sensor type for the\n  signification of the time of a step. Compared to the step detector, the step counter can have a higher latency (up\n  to 10 seconds). Thanks to this latency, this sensor has a high accuracy; the\n  step count after a full day of measures should be within 10% of the actual\n  step count. Both the step detector and the step counter detect when the user\n  is walking, running, and walking up the stairs. They shouldn't trigger when\n  the user is biking, driving, or in other vehicles. The hardware must ensure the internal step count never overflows. The minimum\n  size of the hardware's internal counter shall be 16 bits. In case of imminent\n  overflow (at most every ~2^16 steps), the SoC can be woken up so the driver\n  can do the counter maintenance. As stated in Interaction, while\n  this sensor operates, it shall not disrupt any other sensors, in particular,\n  the accelerometer, which might very well be in use. If a particular device can't support these modes of operation, then this\n  sensor type must not be reported by the HAL. That is, it isn't acceptable to\n  \"emulate\" this sensor in the HAL. This sensor must be low power. That is, if the step detection can't be done\n  in hardware, this sensor shouldn't be defined. In particular, when the step\n  counter is activated and the accelerometer isn't, only steps should trigger\n  interrupts (not accelerometer data). Underlying physical sensor: Accelerometer (+ possibly others as long as low\n  power) Reporting-mode: Special Low-power Implement only the wake-up version of this sensor. getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_TILT_DETECTOR)\nreturns a wake-up sensor A tilt detector generates an event each time a tilt event is detected. A tilt event is defined by the direction of the 2-seconds window average\n  gravity changing by at least 35 degrees since the activation or the last event\n  generated by the sensor. Here is the algorithm: Large accelerations without a change in phone orientation shouldn't trigger a\n  tilt event. For example, a sharp turn or strong acceleration while driving a\n  car shouldn't trigger a tilt event, even though the angle of the average\n  acceleration might vary by more than 35 degrees.\n  Typically, this sensor is\n  implemented with the help of only an accelerometer. Other sensors can be used\n  as well if they do not increase the power consumption significantly. This is a\n  low-power sensor that should allow the SoC to go into suspend mode. Do not\n  emulate this sensor in the HAL. Each sensor event reports 1 in\n  sensors_event_t.data[0]. Underlying physical sensors: Accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope Reporting-mode: Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR) returns a\n  non-wake-up sensor A rotation vector sensor reports the orientation of the device relative to\n  the East-North-Up coordinates frame. It's usually obtained by integration of\n  accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings. The East-North-Up\n  coordinate system is defined as a direct orthonormal basis where: The orientation of the phone is represented by the rotation necessary to\n  align the East-North-Up coordinates with the phone's coordinates. That is,\n  applying the rotation to the world frame (X,Y,Z) would align them with the\n  phone coordinates (x,y,z). The rotation can be seen as rotating the phone by an angle theta around an\n  axis rot_axis to go from the reference (East-North-Up aligned)\n  device orientation to\n  the current device orientation. The rotation is encoded as the four unit-less\n  x, y, z, w components of a unit quaternion: Where: The quaternion is a unit quaternion: It must be of norm 1.\n  Failure to ensure\n  this will cause erratic client behavior. In addition, this sensor reports an estimated heading accuracy: sensors_event_t.data[4] = estimated_accuracy (in radians) The heading error must be less than estimated_accuracy 95% of\nthe time. This sensor must use a gyroscope as the main orientation change input. This sensor also uses accelerometer and magnetometer input to make up\n  for gyroscope drift, and it can't be implemented using only the accelerometer\n  and magnetometer. Underlying physical sensors: Accelerometer and gyroscope (no magnetometer) Reporting-mode: Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor A game rotation vector sensor is similar to a rotation vector sensor but not\n  using the geomagnetic field. Therefore the Y axis doesn't point north but\n  instead to some other reference. That reference is allowed to drift by the\n  same order of magnitude as the gyroscope drifts around the Z axis. See the Rotation vector sensor for details on\n  how to set sensors_event_t.data[0-3]. This sensor doesn't\n  report an estimated heading accuracy:\n  sensors_event_t.data[4] is reserved and should be set to 0. In an ideal case, a phone rotated and returned to the same real-world\n  orientation should report the same game rotation vector. This sensor must be based on a gyroscope and an accelerometer. It can't use\n  magnetometer as an input, besides, indirectly, through estimation of the\n  gyroscope bias. Underlying physical sensors: Accelerometer and (if present) gyroscope (or\n  magnetometer if gyroscope not present) Reporting-mode: Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_GRAVITY)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor A gravity sensor reports the direction and magnitude of gravity in the\n  device's coordinates. The gravity vector components are reported in m/s^2 in the x, y, and z\n  fields of sensors_event_t.acceleration. When the device is at rest, the output of the gravity sensor should be\n  identical to that of the accelerometer. On Earth, the magnitude is around\n  9.8\u00a0m/s^2. If the device possesses a gyroscope, the gravity sensor must use the\n  gyroscope and accelerometer as input. If the device doesn\u2019t possess a gyroscope, the gravity sensor must use the\n  accelerometer and the magnetometer as input. Underlying physical sensors: Accelerometer and magnetometer (no gyroscope) Reporting-mode: Continuous Low-power getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_GEOMAGNETIC_ROTATION_VECTOR)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor A geomagnetic rotation vector is similar to a rotation vector sensor but\n  using a magnetometer and no gyroscope. This sensor must be based on a magnetometer. It can't be implemented using a\n  gyroscope, and gyroscope input can't be used by this sensor. See the Rotation vector sensor for details on\n  how to set sensors_event_t.data[0-4]. Just like for the rotation vector sensor, the heading error must be less than\n  the estimated accuracy (sensors_event_t.data[4]) 95% of the time. This sensor must be low power, so it has to be implemented in hardware. Underlying physical sensors: Accelerometer, magnetometer and (if present)\n  gyroscope Reporting-mode: Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_ORIENTATION)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor Note: This is an older sensor type that has\n  been deprecated in the Android SDK.\n  It has been replaced by the rotation vector sensor, which is more clearly\n  defined. Use the rotation vector sensor over the orientation sensor whenever\n  possible. An orientation sensor reports the attitude of the device. The measurements\n  are reported in degrees in the x, y, and z fields of\n  sensors_event_t.orientation: Please note, for historical reasons the roll angle is positive in the\n  clockwise\n  direction. (Mathematically speaking, it should be positive in the\n  counter-clockwise direction): \nFigure 3. Orientation relative to a device\n   This definition is different from yaw, pitch, and roll used in aviation where\n  the X axis is along the long side of the plane (tail to nose). The orientation sensor also reports how accurate it expects its readings to\n  be through sensors_event_t.orientation.status. See the\n  \nSensorManager\u2019s\n  \nSENSOR_STATUS_* constants for more information on\n  possible values for this field. Uncalibrated sensors provide more raw results and may include some bias but\n  also contain fewer \"jumps\" from corrections applied through\n  calibration. Some\n  apps may prefer these uncalibrated results as smoother and more\n  reliable. For instance, if an app is attempting to conduct its own\n  sensor fusion, introducing calibrations can actually distort results. Underlying physical sensor: Accelerometer Reporting-mode: \n  Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER_UNCALIBRATED)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor An uncalibrated accelerometer sensor reports the acceleration of the device\n  along the three sensor axes without any bias correction (factory bias\n  and temperature compensation are applied to uncalibrated measurements), along\n  with a bias estimate.\n  All values are in SI units (m/s^2) and are reported in the fields of\n  sensors_event_t.uncalibrated_accelerometer: Underlying physical sensor: Gyroscope Reporting-mode: Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_GYROSCOPE_UNCALIBRATED)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor An uncalibrated gyroscope reports the rate of rotation around the sensor axes\n  without applying bias compensation to them, along with a bias estimate. All\n  values are in radians/second and are reported in the fields of\n  sensors_event_t.uncalibrated_gyro: Conceptually, the uncalibrated measurement is the sum of the calibrated\n  measurement and the bias estimate: _uncalibrated = _calibrated + _bias. The x_bias,\n  y_bias and z_bias values are expected to jump as\n  soon as the estimate of the bias\n  changes, and they should be stable the rest of the time. See the definition of the gyroscope sensor for\n  details on the coordinate system used. Factory calibration and temperature compensation must be applied to the\n  measurements. Also, gyroscope drift estimation must be implemented so that\n  reasonable estimates can be reported in x_bias,\n  y_bias and z_bias. If the\n  implementation isn't able to estimate the drift, then this sensor must not be\n  implemented. If this sensor is present, then the corresponding Gyroscope sensor must\n  also be\n  present and both sensors must share the same sensor_t.name and\n  sensor_t.vendor values. Underlying physical sensor: Magnetometer Reporting-mode: Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD_UNCALIBRATED)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor An uncalibrated magnetic field sensor reports the ambient magnetic field\n  together with a hard iron calibration estimate. All values are in micro-Tesla\n  (uT) and are reported in the fields of\n  sensors_event_t.uncalibrated_magnetic: Conceptually, the uncalibrated measurement is the sum of the calibrated\n  measurement and the bias estimate: _uncalibrated = _calibrated + _bias. The uncalibrated magnetometer allows higher level algorithms to handle\n  bad hard iron estimation. The\n  x_bias, y_bias and z_bias values are\n  expected to jump as soon as the\n  estimate of the hard-iron changes, and they should be stable the rest of the\n  time. Soft-iron calibration and temperature compensation must be applied to the\n  measurements. Also, hard-iron estimation must be implemented so that\n  reasonable estimates can be reported in x_bias,\n  y_bias and\n  z_bias. If the implementation isn't able to estimate the bias,\n  then this sensor must not be implemented. If this sensor is present, then the corresponding magnetic field sensor must\n  be present and both sensors must share the same sensor_t.name and\n  sensor_t.vendor values. Reporting-mode: \n  On-change getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_HINGE_ANGLE)\nreturns a wake-up sensor A hinge angle sensor measures the angle, in degrees, between two integral\nparts of the device. Movement of a hinge measured by this sensor type is\nexpected to alter the ways in which the user can interact with the device, for\nexample, by unfolding or revealing a display. Some sensors are mostly used to detect interactions with the user. We don't\n  define how those sensors must be implemented, but they must be low power and\n  it's the responsibility of the device manufacturer to verify their quality in\n  terms of user experience. Underlying physical sensors: Undefined (anything low power) Reporting-mode: One-shot Low-power Implement only the wake-up version of this sensor. getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_WAKE_GESTURE)\nreturns a wake-up sensor A wake up gesture sensor enables waking up the device based on a device\n  specific motion. When this sensor triggers, the device behaves as if the power\n  button was pressed, turning the screen on. This behavior (turning on the\n  screen when this sensor triggers) might be deactivated by the user in the\n  device settings. Changes in settings don't impact the behavior of the\n  sensor: only whether the framework turns the screen on when it triggers.\n  The actual gesture to be detected isn't specified, and can be chosen by the\n  manufacturer of the device. This sensor must be low power, as it's likely to be activated 24/7. Each sensor event reports 1 in sensors_event_t.data[0]. Underlying physical sensors: Undefined (anything low power) Reporting-mode: One-shot Low-power Implement only the wake-up version of this sensor. getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_PICK_UP_GESTURE)\nreturns a wake-up sensor A pick-up gesture sensor triggers when the device is picked up\n  regardless of wherever it was before (desk, pocket, bag). Each sensor event reports 1 in sensors_event_t.data[0]. Underlying physical sensors: Undefined (anything low power) Reporting-mode: One-shot Low-power Implement only the wake-up version of this sensor. getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_GLANCE_GESTURE)\nreturns a wake-up sensor A glance gesture sensor enables briefly turning the screen on to enable the\n  user to glance content on screen based on a specific motion. When this sensor\n  triggers, the device will turn the screen on momentarily to allow the user to\n  glance notifications or other content while the device remains locked in a\n  non-interactive state (dozing), then the screen will turn off again. This\n  behavior (briefly turning on the screen when this sensor triggers) might be\n  deactivated by the user in the device settings. Changes in settings do not\n  impact the behavior of the sensor: only whether the framework briefly turns\n  the screen on when it triggers. The actual gesture to be detected isn't\n  specified, and can be chosen by the manufacturer of the device. This sensor must be low power, as it's likely to be activated 24/7.\n  Each sensor event reports 1 in\n  sensors_event_t.data[0]. Available from Android 13, limited axes IMU sensors\n  are sensors that support use cases where not all three axes (x, y, z) are\n  available. Standard IMU types in Android (such as\n  \nSENSOR_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER\n  and \nSENSOR_TYPE_GYROSCOPE)\n  assume that all three axes are supported. However, not all form factors and\n  devices support 3-axis accelerometers and 3-axis gyroscopes. Underlying physical sensors: Accelerometer Reporting-mode: Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER_LIMITED_AXES)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor An accelerometer limited axes sensor is equivalent to\n  TYPE_ACCELEROMETER but supports cases where one or two axes\n  aren't supported. The last three sensor event values reported by the sensor represent whether\n  the acceleration value for the x, y, and z axes are supported. A value of\n  1.0 indicates that the axis is supported, and a value of\n  0 indicates it isn't supported. Device manufacturers identify\n  the supported axes at build time and the values don't change during\n  runtime. Device manufacturers must set the acceleration values for unused axes to\n  0, instead of having undefined values. Underlying physical sensors: Gyroscope Reporting-mode: \n  Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_GYROSCOPE_LIMITED_AXES)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor A gyroscope limited axes sensor is equivalent to TYPE_GYROSCOPE\n  but supports cases where one or two axes aren't supported. The last three sensor event values reported by the sensor represent whether\n  the angular speed value for the x, y, and z axes are supported. A value of\n  1.0 indicates that the axis is supported, and a value of\n  0 indicates it isn't supported. Device manufacturers identify\n  the supported axes at build time and the values don't change during\n  runtime. Device manufacturers must set the angular speed values for unused axes to\n  0. Underlying physical sensors: Accelerometer Reporting-mode: \n  Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_ACCELEROMETER_LIMITED_AXES_UNCALIBRATED)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor An accelerometer limited axes uncalibrated sensor is equivalent to\n  TYPE_ACCELEROMETER_UNCALIBRATED but supports cases where one or\n  two axes aren't supported. The last three sensor event values reported by the sensor represent whether\n  the acceleration and bias values for the x, y, and z axes are supported.

Underlying physical sensors: Any combination of 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis\n  gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer uncalibrated, and 3-axis gyroscope\n  uncalibrated sensors. Reporting-mode: \n  Continuous A composite limited axes IMU sensor is equivalent to a limited axes IMU\n  sensor but instead of being supported at the HAL, it converts the 3-axis\n  sensor data into the equivalent limited axes variants.

Reporting-mode: Continuous getDefaultSensor(SENSOR_TYPE_HEADING)\nreturns a non-wake-up sensor Available from Android 13, a heading sensor\n  measures the direction in which the device is pointing relative to true north\n  in degrees. The heading sensor includes two SensorEvent values.\n  One for the measured device heading and one for the accuracy of the provided\n  heading value. Heading values reported by this sensor must be between\n  0.0 (inclusive) and 360.0 (exclusive), with\n  0 indicating north, 90 east, 180 south,\n  and 270 west. Accuracy for this sensor is defined at 68 percent confidence. In the case\n  where the underlying distribution is Gaussian normal, the accuracy is one\n  standard deviation. For example, if the heading sensor returns a heading value\n  of 60 degrees and an accuracy value of 10 degrees, there's a 68 percent\n  probability of the true heading being between 50 degrees and 70 degrees.

It is spread over 4.9 hectares (12 acres) of land, comprising five bungalows in Lutyens' Delhi, built in the 1980s, which are the Prime Minister's office, residency zone and security establishment, including one occupied by Special Protection Group (SPG) and another being a guest house. However, even though there are 5 bungalows, they are collectively called 7, Lok Kalyan Marg. It does not house the Prime Minister's Office but has a conference room for informal meetings.[3]\n The entire Lok Kalyan Marg, which lies right across the road, is closed to the public. Rajiv Gandhi was the first Prime Minister to reside at the erstwhile 7 Race Course Road, in 1984. It does not house the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), which is located in the South Block of the Secretariat Building, on Raisina Hill nearby in New Delhi, where the Cabinet Secretariat functions. The nearest Delhi Metro station is Lok Kalyan Marg metro station.[4] When a new Prime Minister is nominated his/her original house is for the time being given a security detail and the new office holder is then advised to move in the 7, LKM at the earliest possible date.[5]\n The residence was earlier called 7, Race Course Road, which changed to 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, following the renaming of the road on which the house is situated, in September 2016.[6]\n Earlier, the Prime Ministers of India lived in their own house or house allotted to them through Parliament, allotment by virtue of being an MP. Jawaharlal Nehru took up residence in Teen Murti Bhavan, which used to be the residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army in British India; it was formerly called the Flagstaff House. After Nehru's death in 1964, the building was converted to the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in 1984.\n The next Prime Minister of India Lal Bahadur Shastri chose 10 Janpath as his official residence, where he stayed 1964\u20131966. It was later allotted to the Congress (I) party, though a part of it became biographical museum, Lal Bhadur Shastri Memorial and Museum at 1, Motilal Nehru Place (formerly 10, Janpath), adjacent to the complex.[7][8] The current resident of 10, Janpath is INC interim President, Sonia Gandhi.[9]\n After the assassination of Indira Gandhi at her 1, Safdarjung Road residence garden while going towards neighbouring 1, Akbar Road office for an interview on 31 October 1984,[10] it was converted into the Indira Gandhi Memorial and Museum. Former Chief Justice of India Sudhi Ranjan Das had previously lived at this address before Indira Gandhi.[citation needed]\n Rajiv Gandhi, her son and successor as Prime Minister, along with his family, became the first occupant of erstwhile 7, Race Course Road, in 1984.\n When V. P. Singh became the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Urban Affairs designated 7, Race Course Road premises occupied by Rajiv Gandhi as the permanent residence and office of the Prime Minister of India to ensure that all successive prime ministers were allotted the same house on assuming office. A government notification on 30 May 1990, officially designated these bungalows as the official residence of Indian Prime Minister.[11]\n In the 1990s I. K. Gujral and some of his predecessors, used 7, Race Course Road as Prime Minister's Office (PMO).[12]\n The 14th and current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, chose 5, Race Course Road as his residence as the erstwhile 7, Race Course Road was being refurbished at that time, after his predecessor Manmohan Singh had vacated it. The erstwhile 7, Race Course Road was chosen as Modi's office.[13]\n The bungalows of the 7 LKM were originally designed by Robert Tor Russell, who was part of British architect Edwin Lutyens\u2019 team, when he was designing New Delhi in the 1920s and 1930s.[14]\n The 4.9-hectare (12-acre) Prime Minister's residence was built in the 1980s. It does not have his office inside the house, but has a conference room for informal meetings. The Prime Minister's residence and office and security spread across five bungalows: Bungalow 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. This includes 5, Lok Kalyan Marg, the Private Residential Zone for the Prime Minister, though he primarily operates from 7, Lok Kalyan Marg.[5][15][16]\n Bungalow 1 is a helipad for the service of Prime Minister which is being used as so since September 2003.[17] Earlier, it was resided in by Dr. S. Venugopal Chary of TRS, who vacated it on the government\u2019s requests with a purpose of increasing the security. It is under the control of the Special Protection Group. After former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan vacated his Bungalow 11, the last addition to the LKM complex was complete. The entire road with bungalows numbering 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 came under Prime Minister\u2019s residential complex.[18]\n Bungalow 3 which was earlier the residence of Dr. Manmohan Singh has now been converted into a guesthouse for Prime Minister's guests.\n Bungalow 9 is occupied by the Special Protection Group (SPG) that guards the Prime Minister. A 1.5-kilometre-long (0.93\u00a0mi) tunnel connects the Indian prime minister's residence to the Safdarjung Airport, where high-importance helicopters land. Constructed beyond Kemal Atat\u00fcrk Marg, Golf Course and Safdarjung Tomb and then an overground drive to surface at the helicopter hangar at the airport, work on the tunnel began in 2010 and was completed by July 2014 and Modi was the first Prime Minister to use it.[19]\n Current prime minister Narendra Modi uses 5, LKM as his residence which has also been used as so by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Rajiv Gandhi.[20]\n In 2001, during the tenure of Vajpayee, a state-of-the-art auditorium was constructed at the cost of \u20b926.58 million (US$350,000) and was named as Panchvati, it has been named after the spot where Ram and Sita had built their hut during their exile. It is equipped for video conferencing and simultaneous translations[17] This can be modelled into 2\u20133 conference rooms and can also act as a banquet for a gather of 200\u2013340 people. This can be used as a cabinet meeting room and can also be arranged to form a theatre.[21]\n While the government-run Special Protection Group (SPG) is the primary agency in charge of the security, it is aided by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF) and the Delhi Police to provide three-rung security for the estate. There is only one entrance to 7 Lok Kalyan Marg, which is guarded by the SPG. Only those visitors whose names have been given to SPG by the prime minister's personal secretaries are allowed in. The rule applies to everybody, including the national security adviser, top bureaucrats, relatives and guests (barring close family) and visitors are expected to carry an identity card. No outside vehicle is allowed to go beyond the checkpoint and even high-profile visitors including cabinet ministers are required to park their official vehicles by the checkpoint. Special SPG vehicles are used to carry the guests from the checkpoint to the residential office of the Prime Minister. The only exception to this rule is for the SPG protectors themselves who are allowed to take the vehicle carrying them into the complex.[20][21]\n The whole area is a no-fly zone and airspace usage around the area is highly restricted and monitored.[20] Over the years, its security has gradually been increased. A bulletproof glass-tube passage was built in 2003, connecting Bungalow 3, at the Prime Minister\u2019s residence, to Panchvati or 7 LKM, where the Prime Minister meets people and delegations and holds official meetings.[5] A concrete wall was added on the periphery, separating the house from the main road, to render any truck bomb or a car bomb attack ineffective. However, the residence is surrounded by various high rise building and public structures, including Samrat Hotel, Ashoka Hotel, and state guesthouses on one side, to the Delhi Gymkhana Club (DCG) and Delhi Race Course which lies on the other. Accordingly, plans for a helipad within the complex were mooted for several years. By 2004, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) took over most of the rooms of Samrat Hotel overlooking the residence and watchtowers were erected inside Delhi Gymkhana. The Delhi Gymkhana can be accessed only via Safdarjung Road.[5] The residence has a power substation, and doctors and nurses from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences are on duty round the clock. There are several ambulances on standby, one of which always accompanies the prime minister's motorcade.[20]  The civic officials ensure that there are no traffic bottlenecks on Kemal Atat\u00fcrk Marg that runs outside the bungalows.[17]\n In 2004, the road was refurbished at a cost of \u20b970 million (US$930,000) to make it the permanent residence of the Indian Prime Minister.[15][20]\n 7 LKM also has massive, manicured lawns and has abundant gulmohar, semal and arjuna trees which homes several birds, including peacocks.[20]\n Besides the secretarial staff, it has a support staff of about 200 gardeners, servants, and electricians. They are employed after a thorough background check.[20]\n The workplace at 7 LKM has two small rooms on either side from the entrance for each of the two personal secretaries. Then there is a small corridor with a visitor's room to the right. Further ahead is a chamber to meet guests. Adjacent to that is the living space for larger meetings, behind which is the dining room where breakfast and lunch meetings are hosted. A corridor from 7 LKM leads to Panchvati which can be segmented into two or three conference rooms or a large banquet hall.[20]\n On the walls are artworks loaned by the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) which are often changed in consultation with the prime minister's office. The gifts received by the Prime Minister are either displayed at 7 LKM or are sent to the toshakhana (treasure house).[20]\n \n \u00a9 2022  All rights reserved.

The purpose of using a flash is when you're in low-light or other challenging lighting situations and want a proper exposure. In many cases when the light isn't adequate, you lower your shutter speed. However, at a certain point (below 1/30s if you can really get your body still, otherwise 1/60s) you'll get camera shake, and motion blur can ruin the photo. In such a case, you're forced to use the standard flash. In addition, there is a third option, and that is the slow sync flash. Slow sync is a feature available on a wide range of digital cameras that enables you to fire the flash at lower shutter speeds. You might wonder why would you want this ability. It permits you to keep shooting in a variety of low-light situations, thereby opening up new possibilities. By using slow sync flash, you can get a properly illuminated subject/foreground, yet still have the low ambient light in the foreground and background register in your frame. Many digital cameras let you set slow sync flash manually, but even on point and shoot cameras you have the ability to shoot at slow sync (typically marked as \u201cParty\u201d or \u201cNight\u201d mode on the Automatic Program selector). You probably haven\u2019t experimented with these modes on your camera, but give it a try. Review the results and think about how you can best use this new tool in your artist\u2019s tool box. The slow sync flash mode lets you select the synchronization of shutter speed and the power/duration of the flash. When you use slow sync, the shutter remains open much longer to allow in more light for your exposure. This means that your main subject needs to remain as still as possible, or if they move slightly their edges will be soft. The flash fires at a specific moment during the longer exposure (which you can select) and the flash duration is much shorter than the shutter speed in \u201cstandard\u201d flash mode. Usually flash photography freezes your image, but the extended shutter speed causes the background to blur out, but is effectively illuminated \u2014 and very much sharp because of the flash. You can use smaller apertures, too, to ensure greater sharpness in the final image. You\u2019ll want to use slow sync flash in any low-light situation when you feel that the normal flash will give you a bland, staid photo. Another application is when photographing an action/sports subject and you want to capture the action with a panning technique (use rear curtain sync for this.) Due to the lower shutter speeds associated with slow sync flash, you need to stabilize the camera to avoid camera shake. You\u2019ll likely need a tripod or monopod with slow sync flash and may want to consider using a cable release  to avoid as much camera shake as possible. When you set your camera for slow sync flash you will most likely be presented with the two options (rear or front curtain sync). As with high sync flash this choice gives you the ability to tell the camera when you want the flash fire. This can either be when the front curtain moves at the beginning of the exposure, or when the rear curtain begins to move at the end of the exposure. Both modes will give you different final results. Rear curtain sync tends to give a faint image trail and a tack-sharp main subject, whereas front curtain sync tends light up the main subject and acquire the ambient light. It\u2019s up to you to do some experimentation to determine the specific photographic properties for each curtain sync mode. This will give you greater proficiency in using the myriad of tools at your disposal. Slow sync flash provides you with creative options when you\u2019re shooting at night or indoors, and it is a great way to avoid the \u201cclich\u00e9\u201d, or uninspired images that you\u2019ll most likely obtain using standard flash mode. Slow synch flash expands the boundaries of flash photography by letting you capture motion (in the form of motion blur) that would normally be missing from a traditional flash photograph. In addition, you get to manipulate an illuminated background without sacrificing depth of field choices. \u00a9 2007 - 2022 ExposureGuide.com We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites."], "https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-712-SoC.406496.0.html": [" The\u00a0Qualcomm Snapdragon 712 (SD712)\u00a0is a fast mid-range ARM-based SoC largely found on Android tablets and smartphones.

He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Modi is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. He is the first prime minister outside of the Indian National Congress to win two consecutive terms with a full majority and the second to complete five years in office after Atal Bihari Vajpayee.  Born to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child and has said he later ran his own stall. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. Modi left home after finishing high-school in part due to an arranged marriage to Jashodaben Chimanlal, which he abandoned and publicly acknowledged only many decades later. Modi travelled around India for two years and visited a number of religious centres before returning to Gujarat. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary. \nSearch Celebrity similar to me\n Birth date Date of death Information source \u00a0OK Height\u00a0ft\u00a0\u00a0\u00a000 \u00bc0 \u00bd0 \u00be11 \u00bc1 \u00bd1 \u00be22 \u00bc2 \u00bd2 \u00be33 \u00bc3 \u00bd3 \u00be44 \u00bc4 \u00bd4 \u00be55 \u00bc5 \u00bd5 \u00be66 \u00bc6 \u00bd6 \u00be77 \u00bc7 \u00bd7 \u00be88 \u00bc8 \u00bd8 \u00be99 \u00bc9 \u00bd9 \u00be1010 \u00bc10 \u00bd10 \u00be1111 \u00bc11 \u00bd11 \u00be\u00a0in\u00a0cm Weight\u00a0lbs\u00a0kg Information source \u00a0OK Breast/Bust size\u00a0in\u00a0cm Waist size\u00a0in\u00a0cm Hips size\u00a0in\u00a0cm Information source \u00a0OK URL on YouTube \u00a0OK \nUsername or Email Address\n\n \nPassword\n\n \n\nRemember Me\n \n\n\n\n \nRegister |\nLost Password\n  English \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 Espa\u00f1ol Italiano Deutsch Portugu\u00eas Fran\u00e7ais T\u00fcrk\u00e7e Nederlands Polski  \u00a9 BodySize.org"], "https://hipertextual.com/2015/04/apertura-f": [" Hipertextual \n\t\t\t\t\tTecnolog\u00eda, ciencia y cultura digital\t\t\t\t Microsoft Lumia 535 - Hipertextual Como ya hemos visto en Hipertextual, existen varios elementos muy importantes, como la ISO y la obturaci\u00f3n, a la hora de tomar una fotograf\u00eda. De entre todos ellos, **la apertura f** ser\u00e1 el que determine gran parte de la luminosidad que llega al sensor de nuestra c\u00e1mara.   El contexto de la fotograf\u00eda con smartphone ha cambiado mucho en \u00fanicamente unos 10 a\u00f1os. Ahora la calidad ofrecida por los m\u00f3viles permite, en la mayor\u00eda de casos, sustituir a una **compacta convencional**, y a veces incluso una c\u00e1mara m\u00e1s avanzada. El p\u00fablico que antes buscaba una c\u00e1mara peque\u00f1a y transportable, ya no requiere comprar otro dispositivo, le basta con su m\u00f3vil.  Por ende, las caracter\u00edsticas de los m\u00f3viles no solo ir\u00e1n adapt\u00e1ndose a las necesidades de aquellos fot\u00f3grafos aficionados, sino tambi\u00e9n a los que buscan tomar im\u00e1genes de una forma m\u00e1s avanzada. Como consecuencia de ello, conceptos propios de la fotograf\u00eda,  hasta ahora desapercibidos para los usuarios de smarphones, tambi\u00e9n empezar\u00e1n a cobrar importancia en este sector. Y uno de esos conceptos ser\u00e1 el de la apertura f.  ## \u00bfQu\u00e9 es la apertura?\nCr\u00e9ditos: Artpill  A grandes rasgos, podemos decir que la apertura de nuestra c\u00e1mara es el orificio por el cual pasa la luz que posteriormente impactar\u00e1 en el sensor. Se expresa como *f*, y cada valor representa la mitad de luz que su precedente, aunque tambi\u00e9n se han ido a\u00f1adiendo pasos intermedios entre \u00e9stos. \n As\u00ed, cuanto **menor** sea el n\u00famero f utilizado, m\u00e1s luz se captar\u00e1 en nuestra fotograf\u00eda. Por ejemplo, si utilizamos un f/2,8 entrar\u00e1 mucha m\u00e1s luz que con un diafragma como f/11, el cual provoca que el orificio de entrada sea m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o que utilizando el primer valor.   No obstante, para determinar el valor de apertura tambi\u00e9n se tiene en cuenta **la distancia focal**, la cual es a la distancia correspondida entre el sensor y el centro \u00f3ptico de la lente que estemos utilizando.  Por lo tanto, cuanto m\u00e1s reducida sea esta distancia, mayor luminosidad podremos enviar al sensor cuando realicemos una fotograf\u00eda. Como ejemplo en smartphones tenemos el del Lumia 830, que tiene una distancia focal de **\u00fanicamente 26 mm**.  Sin embargo, la luminosidad captada no depender\u00e1 \u00fanicamente de la apertura f que utilicemos, tambi\u00e9n influyen aspectos como el sensor, la velocidad de obturaci\u00f3n, o incluso el propio software encargado de ajustar autom\u00e1ticamente esos valores para captar una imagen adecuada, algo en lo que Microsoft ha puesto especial cuidado con el nuevo firmware Lumia Demin.  ## La profundidad de campo\nProfundidad de campo Microsoft Lumia 1020 \n Una de las consecuencias de variar la apertura f es la alteraci\u00f3n de aquello llamado **profundidad de campo**. Entendemos por ello la **cantidad de espacio enfocado** por delante y por detr\u00e1s de nuestro objeto. As\u00ed, cuanto m\u00e1s elevado sea el n\u00famero f empleado, menor ser\u00e1 la profundidad de campo, provocando que la zona de enfoque sea muy reducida.  Ese efecto de desenfoque es popularmente conocido como **bokeh**, y es buscado por una gran cantidad de fot\u00f3grafos. En el campo de los smartphones podemos conseguir adecuadamente este resultado con el **Lumia 735**, que tiene una apertura de f/1,9 y se sit\u00faa como uno de los m\u00f3viles de gama media con mayor posibilidad de abrir el diafragma.  ## Ventajas y desventajas\nMicrosoft Lumia 640 XL - Hipertextual  Adem\u00e1s del ya mencionado incremento de luminosidad y la gran reducci\u00f3n de profundidad de campo, emplear una apertura amplia puede tener otras ventajas. Aunque no lo pensemos inicialmente, poder recibir m\u00e1s luz en el sensor tambi\u00e9n va a estar relacionado con la capacidad de nuestro dispositivo para obtener **im\u00e1genes est\u00e1ticas**,  incluso en situaciones nocturnas. Pero, **\u00bfpor qu\u00e9 afecta a la estabilizaci\u00f3n?**  Al utilizar un diafragma m\u00e1s luminoso podremos ampliar la velocidad de obturaci\u00f3n  \n Realmente, la apertura f no tiene nada que ver con el estabilizador de la c\u00e1mara, pero si tenemos la posibilidad de utilizar un diafragma m\u00e1s luminoso podremos **ampliar la velocidad de obturaci\u00f3n**, haciendo as\u00ed una foto m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida aprovechando la abertura de nuestra lente. Obviamente, si tenemos un **estabilizador integrado**, como es el caso del Lumia 930, la experiencia se mejora a\u00fan m\u00e1s.   Pero no todos son aspectos positivos, cuando se utiliza un numero f muy luminoso tambi\u00e9n existen otros factores que pueden ser perjudiciales para los resultados. Uno de ellos es el de las **aberraciones**, ya que la luz se dispersa por un \u00e1rea mayor antes de plasmarse en el sensor.  Pero tampoco se debe olvidar que, con algunas lentes, se produce un efecto llamado **vi\u00f1eteado**, el cual se manifiesta cuando nuestra c\u00e1mara saca en la imagen una parte del objetivo. Asimismo, en ocasiones puede que una abertura mayor est\u00e9 vinculada a una \u00f3ptica m\u00e1s grande, por lo que el incremento del **peso** se ver\u00e1 incrementado, pero como hemos dicho anteriormente, tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 relacionado con otras caracter\u00edsticas, como la distancia focal.  ## La importancia de la apertura  \n Por lo tanto, despu\u00e9s de todo lo expuesto deber\u00edamos tener informaci\u00f3n suficiente para, a partir de ahora, saber interpretar esos n\u00fameros que se corresponden con la apertura f del pr\u00f3ximo m\u00f3vil que vayamos a comprar.  Por desgracia, en la mayor\u00eda de m\u00f3viles a\u00fan no se permiten utilizar **controles manuales** que nos permitan modificar a nuestro antojo aspectos como la ISO, la velocidad de obturaci\u00f3n o la apertura. Sin embargo, con **Lumia camera** todos los smartphones de Microsoft permiten modificar sus controles manuales, lo que sin ninguna duda permite tener una experiencia m\u00e1s completa y a la justa medida del usuario.

It will offer you the best picture quality and top-of-the line performance speed. Plus, the laptop will have plenty of space to store all your important files and documents. When you are looking for a new laptop, there are many things to consider. One of the most important things to think about is the type of storage that you need. If you are someone who needs a lot of storage, then you will want to choose a laptop with a good amount of space. The 16gb ram 512gb ssd i7 laptops offer a great deal of space and they also offer some really good performance too. If you are looking for a laptop with both of these features, then this is the guide for you. When it comes to choosing a new laptop, one of the first things that you need to take into consideration is the type of usage that you are going to be doing with it. If you are only going to be using your laptop for general tasks such as browsing the internet or sending emails, then you won\u2019t need as much storage as someone who wants to use their laptop for more demanding tasks such as gaming or video editing. This is something that you need to keep in mind when choosing between different models because it can make a big difference in terms of price and performance. The next thing that you should look at when choosing a new laptop is the processor speed. This is something that can be measured in GHz and it basically tells you how fast your computer can process information. The higher the number, the faster your computer will be able to perform tasks. Most people don\u2019t need an ultra-fast processor unless they are planning on doing some serious gaming or video editing but if your needs are basic, then something around 2GHz should suffice. The last thing that you need to take into consideration when choosing a new computer is the size and weight. If portability is important to you, then obviously go for something lightweight but if size doesn\u2019t matter as much, then go for something larger since it usually means better performance too. Just remember that larger laptops tend to cost more so keep this in mind when making your decision.

See our disclosure. Home \u00bb Blog \u00bb How Much Video Can 512GB Hold? A 512GB SD card can hold up to 48 hours of video if you use lower resolutions like 1080p and 720p. Shooting in higher video quality, like 4K or 5K, lowers the amount of video your memory card can hold because of bigger file sizes. Hi, my name is Larry. I\u2019m an expert camera techie who\u2019s been making films for nearly a decade. Over the past 10 years, I\u2019ve used and tested dozens of different SD cards and cameras. In today\u2019s guide, I\u2019m excited to share with you how much video can 512GB hold. Keep reading to learn more! Contents Several factors determine how many videos your 512 GB SD card can hold. This is because your recording settings dictate the size of your video file. Shooting in a high resolution and frame rate creates a large file size. For example, if you record in 4K at 120 frames per second (FPS), your file size would be much larger than if you record with 1080p at 24 FPS. As such, your video file size is influenced by your chosen resolution and frame rate. Your camera also has its own codec, which compresses your videos. Some codecs offer greater compression and smaller files, while others have less compression and larger files. The best tip I can give you is to get your camera and record a 10-minute video using your regular settings. Then, view the size of the video file. For instance, if the 10-minute video file is 1GB, you can multiply 10 minutes by 512 to get 5120 minutes. As such, your 512 GB SD card can hold around 85 hours of video. If you record at 1080p resolution, your 512GB memory card can store up to 48 hours or more of video footage. When you record with 4K video resolution, your 512GB memory card can store up to 12 hours or more of video footage. Your 512GB SD card can store up to 9 hours of 5K video footage. If each of your videos is 10 minutes long, you are able to store 54 total videos.\u00a0 To answer any further questions you may have, I\u2019ve included an FAQ section with some common questions I receive about 512GB SD cards. Yes, 512GB is on the higher end of camera storage size. In fact, many older generation cameras don\u2019t support 512GB SD cards. If your camera supports 512GB SD cards, this is more than enough storage to record videos and take pictures. However, I recommend importing your files to your computer as often as possible to create more space on your SD card when needed. Full HD resolution is the same as 1080p. For this reason, your 512GB SD card can store up to 48 hours of full HD video. If your videos are typically 30 minutes long, your memory card can hold up to 96 total HD videos.\u00a0 If you need a lot of storage space, I recommend buying two 512GB SD cards over a single 1TB SD card. If you only have one SD card, you are at risk of losing all of your files if your card corrupts or gets damaged. So using two SD cards acts as a safety precaution, and 512GB is plenty of storage space for most videographers. When you\u2019re looking for a new SD card for your camera, I recommend checking the manufacturer\u2019s specifications to see what SD cards your camera support. This is because not all cameras support a 512GB SD card. I hope you found this guide helpful as you learn more about video cameras and memory cards. But now I want to hear from you.

However, to make such a call, legacy networks today are struggling to keep up quality of service (QoS), with increasing network congestion. That\u2019s where 4G VoLTE (Voice over long-term evolution) technology has a distinct advantage \u2013 and could make calls even cheaper (or, as in the case of Reliance Jio, free). Why then is there resistance to adopting this technology? Legacy telecom operators in India are up in arms against the recent cut in interconnect usage charge (IUC) by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. This IUC is what got them revenue for carrying calls on their networks. So how is 4G VoLTE better? While there is initial resistance from incumbent operators to switch to 4G VoLTE, they will eventually have to, as there are distinct advantages to the technology. Which means, you and I can enjoy better call connectivity.Also read: Jio Phone First Look: Why So Much Buzz Over a Feature Phone? VoLTE, as the name suggests, transmits voice calls over a data network. Calls are chopped into packets just like how GPRS (general packet radio service) or Internet data is transmitted. This results in much higher quality of calls, as there is very little transmission loss (and hence lower call quality). That\u2019s why some operators call this HD voice quality. The whole issue of an interconnect usage charge is negated if all operators shift to a VoLTE based system, as the technology will be common. There won\u2019t be any differentiation between voice and data. Voice calls carried over data use very little data bandwidth (typically less than 400 Kb for calls). It\u2019s because of this that operators like Reliance Jio are offering unlimited free calls on the service. Also if all operators are on the same technology, others will not have to install equipment to convert data calls into voice calls. 4G VoLTE uses the 800 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,300 MHz bands of spectrum. But unlike voice networks, which have to block off one band to make a call go through and channel data across another band, VoLTE can send both voice and data over the same band simultaneously. This allows for quicker call connectivity. Also these bands can reach further than traditional voice networks, hence you get better coverage. They can also be paired with Wi-Fi networks easily. There are some downsides to pure VoLTE right now. To maintain high quality of service, constant network connectivity is required. If there is a drop in network, a voice call cannot fall back on legacy 3G or 2G systems, and hence the call could drop. However, since VoLTE has better coverage, seamless connectivity can be established with fewer towers than traditional voice networks. The other thing is not all handsets support 4G VoLTE right now. Although the technology is gaining popularity, older phones may not be able to make or receive calls using 4G VoLTe. You will need a handset that is compliant with this technology. The downsides, though, are only temporary. For consumers, it is only going to get better, with other telecom operators now thinking of shifting to VoLTE technology. The advantage they will have though, is the ability to fall back on 2G/3G when needed. That\u2019s something new players like Reliance Jio don\u2019t have. So operators like Airtel and Vodafone shouldn\u2019t despair that the investments made in voice networks are wasted. There is still use for voice systems as well. That\u2019s something these operators can capitalise on to help provide better connectivity to consumers. And, of course, calls will get even cheaper \u2013 perhaps even free like Jio is offering \u2013 as more consumers shift to using data on their mobiles.

The University claims that Narendra Modi scored 62.3 percent as an external student of the varsity.  The details were shared by the Gujarat University after the Central Information Commission (CIC) directed it to provide them to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who had recently criticised the functioning of the panel. After an RTI application to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, which demanded the details of his electoral photo identity (EPIC), Kejriwal said in a letter to the CIC  that he was ready to share information sought by RTI applicants, but the CIC must also order disclosure of educational qualifications of the Prime Minister.  Following Kejriwal\u2019s letter, the CIC had ordered the University of Delhi on Friday, from where Modi pursued his Bachelor of Arts (BA), and Gujarat University, from where he completed his Master\u2019s, to reveal the details of his education qualifications. Vice Chancellor Patel, Gujarat University had responded to this and said that since he had not received any order of the CIC so far, but had only come to know about it from the media, he would give the details to those concerned only if he received the order. However, now the VC confirms Modi\u2019s Master\u2019s degree from Gujarat University. When asked about the details of Modi\u2019s BA degree, Patel said they do not have it. \u201cModi did his MA as an external candidate.

Five years later, over a year ahead of the 2021 elections, Rupani was asked to step down, just like his predecessor Patel was, paving way for Bhupendra Patel to become the CM. The removal of Rupani from the CM post, as much was anticipated, was also sudden in September 2021. In the one year since he stepped aside, Rupani has maintained that he is a staunch party loyalist and will always do as the party says. After recently stating that he will stake claim to the seat only if the party asks him to do so, Rupani himself is not keen on contesting the upcoming elections at all given the way he was asked to step down as the CM, sources said. Even as the bugle for the 2022 elections was blown on 2 November with the declaration of election dates, the race for the Rajkot West seat had begun much earlier. Given the developments taking place, the matter can be looked at from various aspects: Even though Rupani has not apprised the party high command of his willingness to contest from the seat for the third consecutive time, several BJP leaders including Rupani's loyalist Nitin Bharadwaj, Rajkot unit president Kamlesh Mirani, Vala's PA Tejas Batti, ex-councillor Kashyap Shukla, and deputy mayor Darshita Shah are among those who have officially apprised the party of their wish to contest from the constituency. Speaking to The Quint, Mirani said that multiple candidates expressing willingness to get ticket from a seat is a normal phenomenon. However, asked if Rupani has shown any unwillingness to contest, Mirani said, \"He is the best person to answer that.\" For 55 years since 1967 (since its Jan Sangh days), not once has the BJP lost the Rajkot West seat (known as Rajkot II till 2012). The constituency comprises mostly upper-caste Hindu voters, whose loyalty the party has managed to command for over five decades. Former cabinet minister of Gujarat, Speaker of the Gujarat Assembly, and the Governor of Karnataka from 2014-2021, Vajubhai Vala has been winning the Rajkot West seat from 1985-2014, except for a brief period in 2001-2002 when Narendra Modi, now the Prime Minister, held the seat. Clearly the Rajkot West seat is a matter of legacy for the BJP, with an assured victory for any candidate that contests. The differences between Rupani and Vala, though never openly admitted, have been public knowledge. Naturally, Rupani loyalist Bharadwaj and Vala's PA Patti both showing interest in contesting from the seat draws eyeballs. Senior political analyst and editor of a Rajkot daily called 'Headline,' Jagdish Mehta called Bharadwaj \"Rupani's shadow.\" \"Even when Rupani was in Gandhinagar as the CM, Bharadwaj was his man here in Rajkot,\" Mehta claimed, adding that \"Bharadwaj's clout too has taken a dent since the sidelining of Rupani.\" On the other hand, Vala backing his own PA for the ticket from the constituency is clearly a battle of maintaining clouts within the party, he added. Despite claims of being sidelined, Rupani has very much been a part of key decisions of the party and is a member of the core committee formed by state BJP President CR Patil. The core committee is currently tasked with deciding upon the candidates, the final decision on which will reportedly be taken in Delhi on 8 and 9 November. Senior political analyst and journalist from Rajkot, Jwalantbhai Channya said that Rupani could not have declared his wish to contest while being aware that the party does not want him to. \"Rupani is aware that the party is not willing to accommodate him in the garb of its 'no repeat' policy that it is trying to follow. If he declares his interest publicly and is later not given a ticket, that would come as embarrassment to him,\" Channya said. \"No doubt that he has been sidelined. There was no specific reason given when he was asked to resign by the high command. Lots of insiders cited COVID mismanagement in the state as one of the reasons, but Gujarat was not the only BJP state that mismanaged COVID,\" Channya added. After his removal last year, many expected him to get a bigger role at the Centre, just like Anandiben Patel who is currently the Governor of Uttar Pradesh. Rupani has now been made the Punjab in-charge for the BJP, a state where the party has not been able to make headway in the past eight years of winning elections in the country. With the AAP's meteoric rise in the state and the lingering ire of the farmers over the Centre's agricultural laws, cracking Punjab for the party will be an uphill task for Rupani.

On May 26, 2014, he took the oath of office for the first time as Prime Minister of India, and on May 30, 2019, he took the promise for the second time. Additionally, he holds the record for the longest tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat (from October 2001 to May 2014). He has now successfully led Gujarat as its Chief Minister for the fourth term. He started as an impoverished child selling tea, but he worked hard to transform himself into a development-focused leader. He is a very driven man. He is not only the most well-known leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but also an excellent strategist for the party. If you like, you might say that he is a member of parliament from the city of Varanasi, which is also his constituency seat. Narendra Modi Height is the equivalent of 5 feet, 7 inches in feet is 170 centimeters. The pair tied the knot in 1968 when she was probably 17, and Modi was 18. Narendra Modi is married to Jashodaben Modi. September 17, 1950, saw Narendra Modi being born in the Vadnagar Mehsana District. The name Damodar Das Moolchand was given to Narendra Modi by his father, and Hira Ben was the name given to him by his mother. The man who gave birth to Narendra Modi came from a typical middle-class Indian household. He was one of six children, and Narendra Modi was the youngest. When Narendra Modi was younger, he and his father would run a tea kiosk at the local train station. His instructor thought he was a competent student despite not being very interested in what he was learning. The current leader of India is Narendra Modi, who serves as Prime Minister.

He was 13 years old when he first encountered Jashodaben Modi, and he married her when he was 18. They gradually drifted apart when Modi left on a tour that lasted for two years and included visits to Hindu ashrams. Reportedly, their marriage was never finished, and he kept it a secret because if it had been, he would not have been allowed to join the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as a \u2018Pracharak.\u2019 For most of his career, Modi was careful to keep his wedding a secret from the public. The connection that exists between Modi and his mother is compelling. On August 31, 2012, Modi was the first Indian candidate to communicate with people via a live talk on Google Hangouts. This historic event took place in India. Workaholism and introversion contribute to Modi\u2019s character traits, and he maintains a vegetarian diet and practices frugality in his daily life. Since the year 2002, he has been employing a cook by the name of Badri Meena. Many people look up to Modi as a fashion icon because of the gorgeous way he always dresses.

Both of these accolades were awarded to him. Only a few hours before the start of the third day-night Test between India and England on February 24, the world\u2019s largest cricket stadium at Motera, located near Ahmedabad, was dubbed the Narendra Modi Stadium. The stadium was officially opened by Ram Nath Kovind, who also cut the ribbon. Narendra Modi Birthday is September 17, 1950; Narendra Modi was born to a grocers family in Vadnagar, located in the Mehsana district of Bombay State (present Gujarat). He is the third oldest of the six children he has with his parents, Damodardas Mulchand Modi, who passed away, and Hiraben Modi, his mother. His father\u2019s name was Damodardas Mulchand Modi. When Modi was a youngster, he worked with his father to sell tea at the Vadnagar Railway Station. Later in life, Modi and his brother owned a tea stand next to a bus terminal. Narendra Modi Cast is OBC. In 1967, he graduated from Vadnagar\u2019s higher secondary school after completing his studies there. He became a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh when he was just eight years old (RSS). Because he didn\u2019t want to be married, he ran away from home when he was 17 years old and spent the following two years traveling across the United States. During these two years, he said in his interviews that he went to some ashrams that Swami Vivekananda had established. After that, Modi returned to Vadnagar, and after some more time he set out for Ahmedabad again. There, Modi made his home with his uncle, who the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation employed as a cook in the company cafeteria. Let us tell you that in 1970 when he was just 20 years old, he was impressed by the RSS to such a degree that he became the full-time Pracharak, and that he officially joined the RSS in 1971 when he was 21 years old. In the early 1970s, he established a branch of the RSS\u2019s student organization known as the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad in his local region.  There is little question that his involvement with the organization has been of tremendous use to him throughout his political career. His undergraduate degree in politics came from the University of Delhi\u2019s School of Open Learning, and he went on to get a master\u2019s in the same field from Gujarat University. Jashodaben The current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, has a spouse named Narendrabhai Modi. Narendrabhai Modi is a retired Indian educator and is married to Narendra Modi. Following local Tradition, their families arranged for them to wed in Vadnagar. 1968 was the year when they tied the knot.  The marriage between Narendra Modi and Jashodaben was agreed upon following the traditions of the Vadnagar position. It began with a family-organized vow while the couple was still young. According to Narendra Modi\u2019s brother, the pair had their vivaaha, the traditional Hindu ceremony that marks the beginning of a marriage, when Narendra Modi was 18 and Jashodaben was probably approximately 17 years old. Sombhai, Narendra Modi\u2019s sibling, stated that the marriage was compelled on Narendra Modi by his Tradition when he was young in accordance with the old conventional custom of fixing relationships among children. Sombhai also stated that the marriage was never fulfilled as Narendra Modi left the marriage not long after it was solemnized. The old custom of fixing relationships among children was never fulfilled. Jashoda Ben was just 17 years old when she tied the knot with Narendra Modi. At the time, Modi had just turned 18 years old. By the way, after being married for three years, they both ended their relationship with one other and divorced each other. It is widely assumed that Modi\u2019s support of the nation is the motivation; yet, Jashoda Ben does not blame Modi for this and continues to advise rolling the dice. SPG commandos are responsible for protecting Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India (Special Protection Group). The members of the SPG always seem to have a black briefcase with them; why is that? This luggage can protect you from gunshots while you\u2019re on the go.

Vadnagar, in the Mehsana district of Gujarat, is where Narendra Damodardas Modi was born to a prosperous business family. On September 17, 1950, he was born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi and Heeraben Modi. \u00a0As the third oldest of his parents\u2019 six children, Narendra Modi was no exception. By birth, Narendra Modi belongs to the Other Backward Classes category. Amit Shah has been instrumental in every major decision for those two Gujaratis, Narendra Modi and In the last six years. Amit Shah was promoted to president of the BJP and ran the party well, which paved the way for him to be nominated as home minister in Modi 2.0. They see the value of collaborating. Since Shah has seen firsthand how Modi\u2019s popularity has boosted his own, he understands the two are inextricably linked. On many occasions, we saw the Prime Minister\u2019s motorcade. Most of the population is probably already aware of the vehicles the Prime Minister of India used. Still, some people are curious about the make and model of the automobiles he drives. Narendra Modi has made some of the bravest moves that this country needed to experience, such as demonetization and the surgical strike. As the saying goes, \u201cwith power comes responsibility.\u201d Therefore, it is very crucial always to ensure the safety of our beloved Prime Minister. His autos are essential to his security on the road. With a 71 percent approval rating among Indian adults, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the most popular leader in the world, according to Morning Consult, a global leader approval tracker in the United States. The study group interviewed 13 world leaders; PM Modi received the most votes (71%), followed by Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (66%), Mario Draghi (60%), and Fumio Kishida (60%). (48 percent). In 1987, he switched to the more conventional politics of the BJP. In little than a year, he rose through the ranks of the BJP in Gujarat, becoming its General Secretary. By this time, he had already shown himself a masterful event planner. With the right motivations in mind, he proceeded with the challenging task of developing the party\u2019s cadres. By April 1990, the party had gained enough political strength to establish a coalition government at the center. Despite the short-lived nature of this coalition and its subsequent dissolution, the BJP seized power in Gujarat and won a two-thirds majority there on its own in 1995. Since then, the BJP has ruled the state of Gujarat. Heeraben Modi is the name of the Prime Minister\u2019s mother. Narendra Modi is her son. Heeraba, who is 91 years old and has a total of 6 children, is the mother of Narendra Modi, the third of her children. When asked about this in an interview, the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, said that the most significant accomplishment in his mother\u2019s eyes was not when he became Prime Minister but rather when he became the Chief Minister of Gujarat. Before taking his oath as the principal chief minister of the state, Prime Minister Modi reflected on the day he finally got to see his mother. All citizens of India who meet the requirements are eligible to receive government aid under the Narendra Modi Yojana/Scheme. Since becoming Prime Minister in 2014, Honorable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has sent many proposals out of justified worry for India. On September 17, 1950, in the city of Vadnagar, Gujarat, Narendra Modi was born to a family of grocers who belonged to a lower-middle class. He has shown that a person\u2019s caste, creed, or social origin are irrelevant factors when achieving achievement. When he became Prime Minister of India, his mother was still living. He is the first Prime Minister of India to have this distinction. As a member of the Lok Sabha, he is the representative for the Varanasi seat and is known as a brilliant strategist. He has held the position of Prime Minister of India since 2014, and he was the Chief Minister of the state of Gujarat from the year 2001 till the year 2014. In the Lok Sabha Election 2019, Narendra Modi defeated Shalini Yadav of the Samajwadi Party and won by a margin of around 4.79 lac votes. According to the schedule, the ceremony to swear him in for his second term as Prime Minister of India will take place on May 30, 2019. After serving as BJP leader for the previous five years, he has broken the record by being the first person to be re-elected for a second term.

So the first thing to do is to try a known-good rear camera. That would solve both problems at the same time. If the replacement camera doesn't work, than you likely have an issue on the logic board. this would require a micro-soldering repair.

First thing I noticed is that the boot takes a good 5 mins. It also had a slight overheating issue while charging from what I can gather (towards the top of the phone) the camera (front and back) don\u2019t work nor do the flash. I\u2019ve taken all cables off, cleaned them and re-seated them. But it\u2019s still the same, I\u2019ll have try a new camera unless someone else can suggest a better test (I don\u2019t have any spare parts for iPhone 7) Was this answer helpful? 2 Comments: Part 1 Hi Jack, The first thing I would try is to disconnect the cameras, Basically all of the flexes except for the Battery, USB & Screen (it is important to disconnect the battery before you remove the screen connectors & do not reconnect the battery before you have reconnected the Screen!!) I think the heat is coming from the CPU & unless it is excessively hot would be normal, if the Phone is attempting to Boot but there is an issue preventing the bootup sequence then the CPU will get HOT. If the Boot up time is reduced then complete the bootup again but Re-Install onbe additional connector at a time untill you find which connector (If any) are causing the issue? I have to spread my answer between two comment post (Character limitations) please see part 2 \nMar 23, 2019 by \nLeigh Towers \n\n\n Part 2 If the flex to the Home button is damaged it will cause extended Bootup time. The front camera flex on a Iphone 7 is susceptible to damage where the 2 seperate sections of flex are joined (on the part of flex that sits almost immediately to the left of the Screen speaker bracket if you have the Screen sat flat with the glass side down) if this flex is damaged it can cause front speaker & also front Camera issues it is not unusual for the rear camera (& maybe also) the flash to stop working?

This is where the biggest leader of the nation - Prime Minister Narendra Modi stays and goes on about his work.\u00a0 The official name of the Modi House is Panchavati and it remains closed to the general public. It is said that Rajiv Gandhi was the first Prime Minister to live in this residence in 1984 and since 2014 it remains PM House for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\u00a0 In this blog we discuss 8 prominent facts that we doubt you know about the PM House. Right from details on the army of staff that keep the place running to the number of rooms in the residence of Modi House, there is so much to learn. Read on:\u00a0 The Modi House while having all amenities and services, also defines simplicity. Explore this paradox and learn more interesting facts about the PM house. A post shared by Madhukeshwar Desai (@madhukeshwar) A picture taken from inside the residence of Modi House. The PM House at 7 Lok Kalyan Marg in New Delhi was designed between the 1920s and 1930s. No wonder the Bristishers had a role to play. In fact the entire house was designed by architect Robert Tor Russell who was a part of Edwin Lutyens team, the famous British architect known to have designed various government buildings in different parts of Delhi. If you were thinking that the residence of the Prime Minister of India was like any other palatial government bungalow, you are wrong. The PM House is actually made of not one but five bungalows that are spread across 12 acres of land - Bungalows 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are all a part of Modi House. While No. 7 is the Prime Minister\u2019s office, the private residence for the PM is 5 Lok Kalyan Marg.\u00a0 Special Protection Group or SPG as they are called, get to live in Bungalow 9. The people residing here are responsible for the protection of the PM and therefore deserve to live in a residence that is in close proximity to the nation\u2019s top most leader himself. This place is also known to have a tennis court for staff who would like to keep fit and guests who would like to play a couple of hands.\u00a0 Guests of the Prime Minister also get a special place in the premises and are said to live in bungalow 3 when invited. Bungalow 1 today has been used as a helipad since 2003 and the Prime Minister frequents it when using his chopper to travel.\u00a0 While five bungalows may sound a bit too extravagant, note that none of these bungalows are large places. The Prime Minister\u2019s house only has two bedrooms and one additional guest room. There is also a dining room and a living room that can barely accommodate 30 odd people.\u00a0 To reduce traffic congestion a two kilometre underground tunnel was built connecting 7 Lok Kalyan Marg to the Safdarjung Airport. Built beyond the Kamal Ataturk Marg, Golf Course and the Safdarjung Tomb, followed by an underground route that leads to the helicopter hangar at the airport (this is where the WIP helicopters land). The construction of this special tunnel started in 2010 and was completed by 2014. Please Note: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the first PM to use this special tunnel.\u00a0 A post shared by Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) India\u2019s National bird, the peacock in the lawns of Modi House. Visitors and members of the Prime Minister's Office are often raving about the glamourous lawns of the Modi House and rightly so. These lawns are well manicured and huge expanses that are refreshing to look at. Large gulmohar and arjuna trees line the boundaries and peacocks and even monkeys are frequent visitors to these sprawling grounds, as you can see from the images above. Also, know that there is just a single entrance to the premises.\u00a0 A special corridor connects Panchavati to 7 Lok Kalyan Marg and on these walls are special pieces of art like mementos, bowls, and the unique collections that the PM receives as gifts on his world travels. There are also various paintings here loaned to the Modi House by NGMA - National Gallery of Modern Art. This corridor segments into a couple of conference rooms and a large banquet hall. The paintings and mementos here keep rotating and as do the other artefacts, the ones not displayed on this corridor are sent to the Treasure House of the Government also known as Toshkhana.\u00a0\u00a0 A post shared by Shobhit Gosain (@5h0bt) The only entrance to PM House - 7 Lok Kalyan Marg It is no secret that Modi House has the best security that India as a country has to offer. When you first enter the main gate you come across 9 RCR that further takes you to the parking and the reception area.\u00a0 After this you come across the high end security before you are in front of the bungalows 7, 1, 3, and 5. The thing to note is that nobody is allowed to visit the Prime Minister without prior notice - no family, no friends can visit without prior intimation and names of all who want to visit need to be given to SPG guards in advance. Also note, that everyone visiting the PM house needs to carry a valid ID card and this applies even to family members and India\u2019s top bureaucrats.\u00a0 Further, visitors are ferried by the SPG to visit the PM House in special cars that take you to the place you are meant to be at. This area is a no fly zone.\u00a0 If the PM house needs any kind of services at any hour of the day, it\u2019s merely minutes away. Right from top doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences who work in shifts 24 / 7 and a high end ambulance on standby to barbers, tailors, designers and stylists and more.\u00a0 But that is not all, it takes a village to run the Modi House smoothly. And, there is a team of over 50 members that include electricians, gardeners, chefs, and peons available at every beck and call.\u00a0 The staff in the PM house is appointed after a rigorous background check and some of the members here have been a part of this system for decades now.\u00a0 A post shared by BJP - Bharatiya Janata Party (@bjp4india) PM Modi in a meeting with important party members at PM House - 7 Lok Kalyan Marg\u00a0(Image Source: Instagram)\u00a0 Besides the main office inside the PM House, the place has small rooms on either side of two personal secretaries. The right side of the premises is reserved for visitors and further down the corridor is where the guests meet the Prime Minister in a chamber. Adjacent to this space is a larger room where meetings are held and the place is often used as a dining room when the Modi House hosts breakfast or lunch meetings with dignitaries.  We hope you enjoyed the facts about the PM house and the little virtual tour we shared. A stunning heritage site, the Modi house has various aspects that leave visitors in awe.

It is a slightly upgraded variant of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 710. The performance gap between the two chipsets is as small as the gap between their names. The only significant difference is that the Qualcomm Snapdragon 712 has a 100MHz higher CPU clock than the Snapdragon 710. According to Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 712 offers 10% performance improvement over the Qualcomm Snapdragon 710. Let us have a look at what this new chipset has to offer. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 712 is mid-tier SoC, and it uses a 10nm LPP manufacturing process. It has eight Kryo 360 CPU cores clocked at up to 2.3GHz. For graphics, it has Adreno 616 GPU that can support up to QHD+ display and 4K HDR video playback. The chipset has support for up to 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM. The SoC supports Quick Charge 4+ fast charging. There are two Spectra 250 image signal processors that can handle up to dual 20MP, or a single 32MP camera. These image signal processors also have the capability to record 4K videos at 30 frames per second. For connectivity, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 712 has Snapdragon X15 LTE modem that supports up to 800Mbps download, and 150Mbps upload speed. Other connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi ac with 2\u00d72 MU-MIMO, Bluetooth v5.0, GPS (with Glonass, BeiDou, Galileo, QZSS, SBAS), and support for dual-SIM dual-VoLTE. For audio, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 712 has aptX, aptX HD, and aptX Classic codec support. There is also native DSD support for up to 384KHz/32-bit. Although the official specifications sheet says that the Snapdragon 712 has eight Kryo 360 CPU cores clocked at up to 2.3GHz, it is not all true. Snapdragon does not reveal full specifications of the CPU configuration. From what we know, there are two Kryo 360 Gold cores clocked at 2.3GHz, and six Kryo 360 Silver cores clocked at 1.8GHz. The Kryo 360 Gold cores are high-performance cores that kick-in only when more processing power is required. For the rest of the time, six Kryo 360 Silver cores handle most of the tasks. For your information, the Kryo 360 Gold core is basically a derivative of the Cortex-A75, and the Kryo 360 Silver is a derivative of the Cortex-A55. Currently, in the Indian market, you get smartphones with Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 at around INR 15,000. By spending a little more, say around INR 20,000, you will get a smartphone with Qualcomm\u2019s flagship processor, which is the Snapdragon 845. So, there is a very little wiggle room for the Snapdragon 700 series chipsets. Apart from that, there is a lot of performance overlapping between the 600 and the 700 series Snapdragon processors. For example, the Snapdragon 660 has four high-performance cores, while the Snapdragon 710 has only two high-performance cores. So, this creates a lot of confusion not only for consumers but also for manufacturers. As a result, the Snapdragon 700 series is not quite popular as of now. I hope Qualcomm simplifies its processor line-up in the future. \n              realme 10 Pro vs realme 10 Pro Plus\n               \n              Apple iPhone 14 vs Apple iPhone 13\n               \n              OnePlus Nord CE 2 5G vs OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G\n               \n              OnePlus 10 Pro vs OnePlus 10T\n               \n              OnePlus 10R vs OnePlus Nord 2T\n               \n              Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max vs Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max\n               \n              OnePlus Nord 2T vs OnePlus Nord CE 2 5G\n               \n              OnePlus 10T vs OnePlus 10R\n               \n              Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro vs Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro Plus 5G\n               \n              Samsung Galaxy S21 FE vs Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G\n              "], "https://repairmymobile.co/flash/vivo-v19-pd1969f-flash-file/": [" August 6, 2021  Download Vivo V19 PD1969F Flash File: 1- Download Vivo V19 PD1969F Flash File\n2- Download QPST tool. \n3- Install Qualcomm driver.\n4- Run QPST tool.\n5- Add new port (Check device manager), Short test point then connect.\n6- Click Load XML and browse for rawprogram_unsparse.xml in Stock ROM file.\n7- Click Load Patch and browse for patch0.xml in Stock ROM file folder.\n8- Select the firmware by clicking in Browser of Search Path.\n9- Select Download and wait for the flashing to finish.

This site contains affiliate links. As an Amazon Associate, We earn a commission from qualifying purchases at no extra cost to you. The bottom line is, it depends on your use case and storage habits. If you\u2019re a professional video editor or animator, 1TB is the way to go. On the other hand, if you\u2019re a general user and do data cleanups often, 512GB will do just fine. I\u2019ve been using a MacBook Pro for work-related tasks for the last 5+ years, and know the Mac ecosystem both from a hardware and software perspective. In this article, I\u2019ll differentiate between both the 512GB and 1TB models. Then I\u2019ll try to guide you using your workloads and technical requirements and help you make a better-informed choice in terms of which model is right for you. If this introduction has pricked your ears, keep reading! Contents In the current model year, Apple offers the MacBook Pro with a range of storage options.\u00a0 Starting from 256GB all the way to 2TB for the 13\u201d model, and from 512GB to over 8TB with the 14\u201d and 16\u201d models. In this article, we\u2019re going to discuss which is best for you. Of course, buying the 1TB model costs extra, but you don\u2019t want to end up with less than you need and then have to carry around portable SSDs everywhere with your MacBook Pro. On the other hand, buying one with more storage than you need can be an expensive mistake. So, it\u2019s always wise to calculate your current and future requirements and then buy the right one accordingly. With that being said, let\u2019s discuss which model is suitable for which type of user: First, let\u2019s talk about the 512GB model \u2014 what kind of use-cases, applications, and workloads it is optimal for: Now onto the 1TB model; although it costs extra, it\u2019s a great bang for your buck if you\u2019re a professional user: Overall, the 512GB model is suitable for general use-cases that don\u2019t require multiple high-end applications and heavy files. On the other hand, the 1TB model is optimal for users who often work with advanced applications and need access to a lot of files simultaneously. By reading all of this, you\u2019ve probably already made a buying decision by now. But it\u2019s always useful to know some ways you can use your storage efficiently too. These tips will also come in handy if you\u2019ve already bought a MacBook Pro and are having trouble with the limited storage: This might sound obvious but the best way to clear up storage on your MacBook Pro is to get rid of junk and unnecessary files. In macOS, you can do this easily using the Finder window or via a Mac cleaning app to save time. Yes, I know, having to carry around an external drive with your MacBook Pro can be a bit tedious. But it\u2019s one of the most convenient and direct ways to increase your local storage capacity. There\u2019s a wide variety of SSDs you can choose from based on your use case. From rugged options like the Samsung T7 Shield to more light and portable ones like Seagate OneTouch. Based on which SSD you go for, be sure to buy the correct adapter so that you can connect it with your MacBook Pro successfully. If you have a fast Internet connection, you can always take advantage of free-to-use cloud services too. Besides Apple\u2019s own iCloud, there\u2019s Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive. This isn\u2019t only limited to files and applications either. You can even game on the cloud these days with services like Google\u2019s Stadia and Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now. Although MacBooks generally aren\u2019t used for gaming, if you use yours for that purpose, services like this will save you a ton of storage space. In addition to that, having a NAS (network-attached storage) system for yourself is like having your own personal cloud at home. You\u2019ll love it if you\u2019re a professional content creator and work with 4K footage, but it is hard to set up and can get expensive. Here are some related questions you might have about MacBook Pro, see my quick answers below. Even if you have the necessary storage space, you might still want to know ways to back up your most important files. Many people use external SSDs or HDDs to back up their files, but by far the most secure way is cloud storage. When it comes to Apple users, the safest and more reliable cloud storage service is iCloud. It can easily be accessed across your Apple ecosystem and also authenticated and secured across all your devices. In macOS you can access the iCloud Drive directly from the Finder window, no browser is required: Once uploaded here, you can access those files across all your Apple devices. Apple provides 5GB of free space with a default account. If you want more than that, you can upgrade to iCloud+. This is actually more important than you might realize. Not all of the storage space advertised is actually available for storing files and applications. macOS Monterey, the one that is pre-installed in the latest MacBook Pro, occupies around 12GB of storage space. Adding to that, let\u2019s not forget Apple\u2019s pre-installed apps like Safari, iMovie, and GarageBand. All in all, keep in mind that a large chunk of the advertised storage space is eaten up by the pre-installed apps and files; so try to aim a bit higher than what you require. As I noted before, Apple offers up to a whopping 8TB of storage in their MacBook Pro. This costs a high premium, of course. But who is it for? This is mostly for professional video editors, animators, or filmmakers; people that need a ton of blazing-fast storage on hand at all times. I hope my article finally resolved your query and sent you in the right direction! If all this was a bit complicated for you, just remember that a good rule of thumb is to avoid the lowest level of storage available as well as the highest: go for something middle of the road. Did you make a final buying decision based on this article? Or, do you feel like I\u2019ve missed something? If yes, let me know in the comment section! Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *   \n\n  \u0394 Rob \u201cOf course, with a MacBook Pro, you can only use a Thunderbolt-enabled SSD.\u201d\n\u2013 that\u2019s incorrect, I\u2019m almost certain. It\u2019s not just those SSDs, it\u2019s others as well. The correct answer I believe is that the standard supports what you mention AND is backward compatible \u2013 with the appropriate cable or adapter \u2013 according to the link below.  And so far, from my own experience, I can say that my 2016 MBP thunderbolt 3 ports will accept external ssd drives with a usb-c cable which suggests the same for thunderbolt 4.

We are looking forward to hearing from you. is setting up a dedicated Valheim a hustle?  Place an order instead Running a dedicated server is a great way to provide a persistent world in which you andyour friends can play anytime. Setting up a dedicated server requires some cursory scriptingknowledge and, more importantly, knowing how to set up your router to allow data to be sentto and from the server and its connected clients. This guide will help you script the server application but due to the multitude of router andmodem types in use today, and differing internet connection setups, we can\u2019t provide anydetailed instructions on how to configure your router. Please refer to your router manual orISP. Before running the Server, you have to manually enter some relevant information in the\u2018start_headless_server.bat\u2019-file (Linux: \u2018start_server.sh\u2019). We recommend that you make a copy of this file and enter the required information in thecopy instead of the original, since the original file will be reset each time it is updated inSteam (requiring you to re-enter your information). Just be aware that you won\u2019t be able tolaunch the copy from Steam, since that shortcut only points to the original filename. A PLEASE NOTE: The most important thing is to make sure that the Server uses a Port Range that has access to the Internet. This is done by \u2018Port Forwarding\u2019, please referto your Router manual for details on how to do this. The default Port Range that the Serveruses is 2456-2457. 1.When you wish to stop running the server, it is important that you close it bypressing CTRL+C in the Command-window. If you close it by clicking the X in thewindow frame the Server may keep running in the background, we don\u2019t really know! You can edit three separate text-files to set  1) who has admin privileges,  2) who is bannedfrom your server, and  3) who is permitted on your server. \fThese three files, located in the default save path, are called \u2018adminlist.txt, bannedlist.txt\u2019,and permittedlist.txt. Add Steam IDs (one per line) to set desired roles. Please note that adding a person on the permitted list will ban everyone else from the server. In-Game: Admin console commands (F5 to bring down console) Slots, or \u201cPlayer Slots\u201d, are the total number of spaces on a game server available to players.The easiest way to describe slots is to think of desks in a classroom. Say a single classroom has 25 desks, which means it can support up to 25 students at a time. Slots work the same way! Just think of the classroom as your server, the desks as your amount of slots, and the students as your players! Player slots (the \u201cdesks\u201d) are not assigned to any specific players, so once a slot is open, any player can fill it. Your total amount of slots simply asks as a maximum player count so only X amount of players may connect to your server at a time. Player slots won\u2019t affect your whitelist in any way. If you enable whitelisting, whitelisted players can join so long as open slots are available. Slots don\u2019t affect the server in any way other than a player\u2019s ability to connect if the server has an open slot available or not. Slots alone won\u2019t cause anything, positive or negative. but the problem comes in where other games utilize more resources on the server. this will impact the experience You\u2019re more than welcome to fill your server with players and we hope that those of you looking to do so do! However, you\u2019ll want to make sure that you have the appropriate settings and resources so your players have a great experience. While slots don\u2019t affect the server, memory and other configurations definitely do. Insufficient memory, lack of restarts, etc. can cause poor performance or even server crashes. While the average server owner generally doesn\u2019t have this concern, slots are often used by server owners who run networks, have limited funds, or for special events.

He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Modi is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. He is the first prime minister outside of the Indian National Congress to win two consecutive terms with a full majority and the second to complete five years in office after Atal Bihari Vajpayee.[2]\n Born to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child and has said he later ran his own stall. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. Modi left home after finishing high-school in part due to child marriage to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, which he abandoned and publicly acknowledged only many decades later. Modi travelled around India for two years and visited a number of religious centres before returning to Gujarat. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.\n Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[lower-alpha 1] or otherwise criticised for its handling of it. A Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally.[lower-alpha 2] His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise.[10] His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[lower-alpha 3]\n Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the Indian lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy; he has centralised power by abolishing the Planning Commission. He began a high-profile sanitation campaign and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. He initiated a controversial demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes.\n Following his party's victory in the 2019 general election, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. His administration also introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, which resulted in widespread protests across the country. In 2020, Modi's government began construction of the Ram Temple on disputed land in Ayodhya at the former site of the Babri Masjid mosque, fulfilling long-held BJP policy. Described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.[lower-alpha 4]\n Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915\u20131989) and Hiraben Modi (born c. 1920).[19] Modi's family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community,[20][21][22] which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government.[23][24]\n As a child, Modi helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and said that he later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus.[25] Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, with interest in theatre.[26] Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and his teachers and students noted this.[27] Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.[28][29]\n When eight years old, Modi discovered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor.[30] While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980.[31]\n Also in Narendra Modi's childhood, in a custom traditional to his caste, his family arranged a betrothal to a girl, Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when they were teenagers.[32][33] Sometime thereafter, he abandoned the further marital obligations implicit in the custom,[34] and left home, the couple going on to lead separate lives, neither marrying again, and the marriage itself remaining unmentioned in Modi's public pronouncements for many decades.[35] In April 2014, shortly before the national elections that swept him to power, Modi publicly affirmed that he was married and his spouse was Jashodaben; the couple has remained married, but estranged.[36]\n Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he went have emerged.[37] In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education.[38][39][40] Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi's life.[41]\n In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which Modi wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati.[42] Modi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968\u201369.[43] Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad.[44] There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.[45][46]\n In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city.[47][48][49] After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS,[46] working under Inamdar.[50] Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him.[50] Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001.[51]\n In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from School of Open Learning[52] at University of Delhi,[53][54] graduating with a third class.[55] Five years later, in 1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class[56][57] as an external distance learning student.[58]\n In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as \"The Emergency\", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.[59][60] Modi was appointed general secretary of the \"Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\", an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.[61] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.[62][63] Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.[64] During this period, Modi wrote a book in Gujarati, Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In The Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency.[65][66] Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes, as well as several other national political figures.[67] In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a Sikh.[64]\n Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency.[68] He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985.[31] In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers.[69] After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.[70]\n Modi rose within the party and was named a member of the BJP's National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise L. K. Advani's 1990 Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991\u201392 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity).[26][71][72] However, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in Ahmedabad; friction with Shankersingh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played a part in this decision.[72] Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani, and as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly elections.[72][31][73][74] In November of that year Modi was elected BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.[73][75] The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections.[26] Modi, on the selection committee for the 1998 Assembly elections in Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as key to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections,[73][76] and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year.[77]\n In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.[73][78][79] The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement.[26] Although BJP leader L. K. Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was \"going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all\". On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections.[80] Modi was sworn in as Chief Minister on 7 October 2001,[81] and entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 by winning a by-election to the Rajkot \u2013 II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC by 14,728 votes.[82]\n On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[lower-alpha 5] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[85][86] In making a public statement after the incident, Modi declared it a terrorist attack planned and orchestrated by local Muslims.[5][85][87] The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh across the state.[88][89] Riots began during the bandh, and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.[85][88][89] The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.[85][90] The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed.[91] Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000.[85][92] Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.[93] Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women.[4][94]\n The government of Gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots,[3][4][5] and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation.[95] Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom, while others have called it an example of state terrorism.[96][97][98] Summarising academic views on the subject, Martha Nussbaum said: \"There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law.\"[4] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating.[88][89] The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh, despite such actions being illegal at the time.[5] State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.[99] Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.[100] During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.[4][87][101] In 2012 Maya Kodnani, a minister in Modi's government from 2007 to 2009, was convicted by a lower court for participation in the Naroda Patiya massacre during the 2002 riots.[102][103] Although Modi's government had announced that it would seek the death penalty for Kodnani on appeal, it reversed its decision in 2013.[104][105] On 21 April 2018, the Gujarat High Court acquitted Kodnani while noting that there were several shortfalls in the investigation.[106]\n Modi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, Modi said that \"What is happening is a chain of action and reaction.\"[4] Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.[107] In March 2008, the Supreme Court reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.[95][108][109] In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri (widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre), in April 2009 the court also asked the SIT to investigate the issue of Modi's complicity in the killings.[108] The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.[108][110] In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT's position, he said that Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.[111][112] The Supreme Court gave the matter to the magistrate's court. The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jaffri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013 the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister.[113]\n In the aftermath of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.[114] Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted.[115] His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved.[116][117] Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002.[118] In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.[119] Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign,[120][121][122][123] and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters.[118] He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 113,589 of 154,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes.[124] On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term.[125] Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly.[3][120]\n During Modi's second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development.[3][78][120] Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP),[126] entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry,[78] and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP.[126][127] Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions.[126] Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a foreword to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.[128][129]\n Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister)[130][131] distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.[132][133]\n Questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed under the aegis of the International Religious Freedom Act,[134][135] the only person denied a US visa under this law.[136] The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[137] and the EU[138] lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington.[139][140]\n During the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism.[141] In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \"\u00a0for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings.[142] In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a \"spiritual experience\" for Valmiks, a sub-caste of Dalits.[143][144] However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct.[145] After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat's 1,600-kilometre (990\u00a0mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats.[146] In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post,[147] and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election.[148]\n The Sardar Sarovar Dam during a 2006 height increase As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth 6.6\u00a0trillion were signed.[78]\n The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them.[149] Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.[150] As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India.[149] The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use[151] led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007.[152] Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4\u20136% of the area intended.[149] Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent \u2013 the highest of any state.[151] However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992\u201397 INC government was 12.9 percent.[153] In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata to Gujarat.[154]\n The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed.[153] Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised,[149] according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.[155]\n Modi addressing graduates of the Gujarat National Law University in 2012 A contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat's economic development during Modi's tenure as chief minister.[156] The state's GDP growth rate averaged 10% during Modi's tenure, a value similar to other highly industrialised states, and above that of the country as a whole.[154] Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office, and scholars have stated that growth did not accelerate during Modi's tenure.[157] Under Modi, Gujarat topped the  \"ease of doing business\" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years.[158] In 2013, Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for \"economic freedom\" by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states.[154][159] In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.[3] Tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states, as was land. Modi's policies to make Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones, where labour laws were greatly weakened.[120]\n Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the \"alarming\" category on the India State Hunger Index.[160][161] A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found that Gujarat under Modi had a poor record with respect to immunisation in children.[162]\n Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.[100] It showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined.[100] With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below most Indian states.[100] The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits, and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities.[100] Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index.[7] Under Modi, the state government spent far less than the national average on education and healthcare.[100]\n Modi with Anandiben Patel at a meeting of BJP MLAs after his election as prime minister. Patel succeeded him as Gujarat chief minister. Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.[120] He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra.[120] His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012.[120] During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.[120]\n While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people,[118] something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt.[163] The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure[164] and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995).[165]\nIn later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates.[166] In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests by Indian-Americans.[167]\n Narendra Modi hands over his resignation as Maninagar MLA to the Speaker of the Gujarat Vidhan Sabha Natrendra Modi submits his resignation as Gujarat Chief Minister to the Governor After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014. Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister.[168]\n In September 2013 Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election.[169][170] Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modi's candidature,[171] including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were \"concerned with their personal agendas\".[172] Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's election campaign.[173][174] Several people who voted for the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party.[169][175][176] The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.[171][177] The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.[156]\n Modi meets his mother after winning the 2014 elections During the campaign, Modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous INC government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat.[156][171] Modi projected himself as a person who could bring about \"development,\" without focus on any specific policies.[171] His message found support among young Indians and among middle-class citizens.[156] The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism.[156] Prior to the election Modi's image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, but during the campaign the BJP was able to shift this to a focus on Modi's neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development,[174] although Hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign.[14][171][175] The BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media.[161] Modi's campaign blitz cost approximately 50 billion (US$800\u00a0million),[156] and received extensive financial support from corporate donors.[161] In addition to more conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media,[156][171] and addressed more than 1000 rallies via hologram appearances.[14]\n The BJP won 31% of the vote,[13] and more than doubled its tally in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984.[174][175] Voter dissatisfaction with the INC, as well as with regional parties in North India, was another reason for the success of the BJP,[175] as was the support from the RSS.[171] In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before. It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims.[175] The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the right-wing.[156][175][178][179] Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism.[180]\n Modi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies: Varanasi and Vadodara.[181] He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi and Madhusudan Mistry of the INC in Vadodara by 570,128 votes.[182] Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, was appointed prime minister by India's president.[183][184] To comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat.[185]\n Template:For timeline\n Modi with the Chief Minister of Nagaland, T. R. Zeliang, and Naga people in Northeast India, December 2014 Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014. He became the first Prime Minister born after India's independence from the British Empire.[186] His first year as prime minister saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations.[129][187] Modi's efforts at centralisation have been linked to an increase in the number of senior administration officials resigning their positions.[129] Initially lacking a majority in the Rajya Sabha, or upper house of Indian Parliament, Modi passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power.[188] The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.[13]\n In December 2014 Modi abolished the Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog.[189][190] The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister.[188][189][190][191][192] The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.[190]\n The Modi government launched investigations by the Intelligence Bureau against numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations in the first year of the administration. The investigations, on the grounds that these organisations were slowing economic growth, was criticised as a witchhunt. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure.[129] Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz.[191] Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government.[129] This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi's style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.[129][188]\n Modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; a total of 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous governments over a span of 64 years.[193][194][195] He started a monthly radio programme titled \"Mann Ki Baat\" on 3 October 2014.[196] Modi also launched the Digital India programme, with the goal of ensuring that government services are available electronically, building infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boosting manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promoting digital literacy.[197][198]\n Modi launched Ujjwala scheme to provide free LPG connection to rural households. The scheme led to an increase in LPG consumption by 56% in 2019 as compared to 2014.[199] In 2019, a law was passed to provide 10% reservation to Economically weaker sections.[200]\n He was again Second swearing-in ceremony of Narendra Modi|sworn in as Prime minister on 30 May 2019. On 30 July 2019, Parliament of India declared the practice of Triple Talaq as illegal, unconstitutional and made it punishable act from 1 August 2019 which is deemed to be in effect from 19 September 2018.[201][202][203] On 5 August 2019, the government moved resolution to scrap Article 370 in the Rajya Sabha,[204] and also reorganize the state with Jammu and Kashmir serving as one of the union territory and Ladakh region separated out as a separate union territory.[205] In 2019, Ayodhya dispute was resolved. The Supreme Court ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give alternate 5 acre land to Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque.[206]\n Modi with other BRICS leaders in 2019. Left to right: Xi, Putin, Bolsonaro, Modi and Ramaphosa. Modi and Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore officially launched APIX (Application Programming Interface Exchange) a global Fintech Platform at the Singapore FinTech Festival in 2018. The economic policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, based on a neoliberal framework.[191][207] Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways.[191][208][209] Other proposed reforms included making it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them;[207] some of these proposals were dropped after protests.[210] The reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP.[207] The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers.[191]\n The funds dedicated to poverty reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly decreased by the Modi administration.[129] The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6% of GDP during the Congress government to 12.6% during Modi's first year in office.[191] Spending on health and family welfare declined by 15%, and on primary and secondary education by 16%.[191] The budgetary allocation for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, or the \"education for all\" programme, declined by 22%.[191] The government also lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, increased sales taxes, and reduced customs duties on gold, and jewellery.[191] In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices.[211]\n Modi at the launch of the Make in India programme In September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub.[191][212] Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market.[191] Modi's administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it.[213] The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse.[188] Modi's government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017.[214]\n In his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate black money.[215] On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised \u20b9500 and \u20b91000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism.[216] The move led to severe cash shortages,[217][218][219] a steep decline in the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50,[220] and sparked widespread protests throughout the country.[221] Several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash.[222][223] In the subsequent year, the number of income tax returns filed for individuals rose by 25%, and the number of digital transactions increased steeply.[224][225]\n Over the first four years of Modi's premiership, India's GDP grew at an average rate of 7.23%, higher than the rate of 6.39% under the previous government.[226] The level of income inequality increased,[227] while an internal government report said that in 2017, unemployment had increased to its highest level in 45 years. The loss of jobs was attributed to the 2016 demonetisation, and to the effects of the Goods and Services Tax.[228][229]\n In his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the amount of money spent by the central government on healthcare.[162] The Modi government launched New Health Policy (NHP) in January 2015. The policy did not increase the government's spending on healthcare, instead emphasising the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including reducing child and maternal mortality rates.[230] The National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices received nearly 20%[231][232] less funds in 2015 than in the previous year. 15 national health programmes, including those aimed at controlling tobacco use and supporting healthcare for the elderly, were merged with the National Health Mission. In its budget for the second year after it took office, the Modi government reduced healthcare spending by 15%.[233] The healthcare budget for the following year rose by 19%. The budget was viewed positively by private insurance providers. Public health experts criticised its emphasis on the role of private healthcare providers, and suggested that it represented a shift away from public health facilities.[234] The healthcare budget rose by 11.5% in 2018; the change included an allocation of 2000 crore for a government-funded health insurance program, and a decrease in the budget of the National Health Mission.[235] The government introduced stricter packaging laws for tobacco which requires 85% of the packet size to be covered by pictorial warnings.[236] An article in the medical journal Lancet stated that the country \"might have taken a few steps back in public health\" under Modi.[230] In 2018 Modi launched the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, a government health insurance scheme intended to insure 500\u00a0million people. 100,000 people had signed up by October 2018.[237]\n Modi discussing the COVID-19 pandemic with Chief Ministers via videoconferencing in June 2020 Modi emphasised his government's efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health.[230] On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (\"Clean India\") campaign. The stated goals of the campaign included eliminating open defecation and manual scavenging within five years.[238][239] As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them.[240][241][242] The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants.[243] The administration plans to construct 60\u00a0million toilets by 2019. The construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the toilets constructed for them.[239][240][241] Sanitation cover in the country increased from 38.7% in October 2014 to 84.1% in May 2018; however, usage of the new sanitary facilities lagged behind the government's targets.[244] In 2018, the World Health Organization stated that at least 180,000 diarrhoeal deaths were averted in rural India after the launch of the sanitation effort.[245][246]\n Modi pays obeisance at Tirumala Temple in Andhra Pradesh During the 2014 election campaign, the BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders known to have opposed Hindu nationalism, including B. R. Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Ram Manohar Lohia.[129] The campaign also saw the use of rhetoric based on Hindutva by BJP leaders in certain states.[247] Communal tensions were played upon especially in Uttar Pradesh and the states of Northeast India.[247] A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code was a part of the BJP's election manifesto.[14]\n The activities of a number of Hindu nationalist organisations increased in scope after Modi's election as Prime Minister, sometimes with the support of the government.[129][247] These activities included a Hindu religious conversion programme, a campaign against the alleged Islamic practice of \"Love Jihad\", and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right wing Hindu Mahasabha.[129] Officials in the government, including the Home Minister, defended the conversion programmes.[247] Modi refused to remove a government minister from her position after a popular outcry resulted from her referring to religious minorities as \"bastards.\"[129] Commentators have suggested, however, that the violence was perpetrated by radical Hindu nationalists to undercut the authority of Modi.[129] Between 2015 and 2018, Human Rights Watch estimated that 44 people, most of them Muslim, were killed by vigilantes; the killings were described by commentators as related to attempts by BJP state governments to ban the slaughter of cows.[248]\n Modi at the Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi Links between the BJP and the RSS grew stronger under Modi. The RSS provided organisational support to the BJP's electoral campaigns, while the Modi administration appointed a number of individuals affiliated with the RSS to prominent government positions.[248] In 2014, Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR).[14] Historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the BJP, questioned his credentials as a historian, and stated that the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism.[14][249][250]\n The North East Delhi riots, which left more than 40 dead and hundreds injured, were triggered by protests against a citizenship law seen by many critics as anti-Muslim and part of Modi's Hindu nationalist agenda.[251][252][253][254]\n Modi with U.S. President Donald Trump at Namaste Trump rally in Ahmedabad, India Foreign policy played a relatively small role in Modi's election campaign, and did not feature prominently in the BJP's election manifesto.[255] Modi invited all the other leaders of SAARC countries to his swearing in ceremony as prime minister.[256][257] He was the first Indian prime minister to do so.[258]\n Modi meeting Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi in New Delhi in January 2018 Modi's foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding INC government, focused on improving economic ties, security, and regional relations.[255] Modi continued Manmohan Singh's policy of \"multi-alignment.\"[259] The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially in East Asia, with the use of slogans such as \"Make in India\" and \"Digital India\".[259] The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as with Israel.[259]\n During the first few months after the election, Modi made trips to a number of different countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits.[255] One of Modi's first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid.[260] Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country.[257] While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.[257]\n In 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land exchange deal with Bangladesh about the India\u2013Bangladesh enclaves, which had been initiated by the government of Manmohan Singh.[188] Modi's administration gave renewed attention to India's \"Look East Policy\", instituted in 1991. The policy was renamed the \"Act East Policy\", and involved directing Indian foreign policy towards East Asia and Southeast Asia.[259][261] The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with Myanmar, through the state of Manipur. This represented a break with India's historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade.[261]\n The President of Israel Reuven Rivlin and Chief of General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Gadi Eizenkot with Modi India's nominal military spending increased steadily under Modi.[262] The military budget declined over Modi's tenure both as a fraction of GDP and when adjusted for inflation.[263][264] A substantial portion of the military budget was devoted to personnel costs, leading commentators to write that the budget was constraining Indian military modernisation.[263][264][265]\n The BJP election manifesto had also promised to deal with illegal immigration into India in the Northeast, as well as to be more firm in its handling of insurgent groups. The Modi government issued a notification allowing Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to legalise their residency in India. The government described the measure as being taken for humanitarian reasons but it drew criticism from several Assamese organisations.[266]\n The Modi administration negotiated a peace agreement with the largest faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCM), which was announced in August 2015. The Naga insurgency in northeast India had begun in the 1950s.[266][267] The NSCM and the government had agreed to a ceasefire in 1997, but a peace accord had not previously been signed.[267] In 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the Khaplang faction of the NSCM (NSCM-K). The NSCM-K responded with a series of attacks, which killed 18 people.[266] The Modi government carried out a raid across the border with Myanmar as a result, and labelled the NSCM-K a terrorist organisation.[266]\n Modi promised to be \"tough on Pakistan\" during his election campaign, and repeatedly stated that Pakistan was an exporter of terrorism.[268][269][270] On 29 September 2016, the Indian Army stated that it had conducted a surgical strike on terror launchpads in Azad Kashmir. The Indian media claimed that up to 50 terrorists and Pakistani soldiers had been killed in the strike.[271][272][273] Pakistan initially denied that any strikes had taken place.[274] Subsequent reports suggested that Indian claim about the scope of the strike and the number of casualties had been exaggerated, although cross-border strikes had been carried out.[268][275][276] In February 2019 India carried out airstrikes in Pakistan against a supposed terrorist camp. Further military skirmishes followed, including cross-border shelling and the loss of an Indian aircraft.[277][278][279]\n Modi (right) at CoP21 Climate Conference, in Paris, announcing the founding of an International Solar Alliance (ISA). November 2015. In naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the \"Ministry of Environment and Forests\" the \"Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change.\"[280] In the first budget of the government, the money allotted to this ministry was reduced by more than 50%.[280] The new ministry also removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection. These included no longer requiring clearance from the National Board for Wildlife for projects close to protected areas, and allowing certain projects to proceed before environmental clearance was received.[191][280] The government also tried to reconstitute the Wildlife board such that it no longer had representatives from non-governmental organisations: however, this move was prevented by the Supreme Court.[280]\n Modi also relaxed or abolished a number of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating.[191][281] Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas.[281] In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries.[280] The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.[281]\n Under the UPA government that preceded Modi's administration, field trials of Genetically Modified (GM) crops had essentially been put on hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods.[282] Under the Modi government these restrictions were gradually lifted.[282] The government received some criticism for freezing the bank accounts of environmental group Greenpeace, citing financial irregularities, although a leaked government report said that the freeze had to do with Greenpeace's opposition to GM crops.[282]\n In accordance with Ghanchi tradition, Modi's marriage was arranged by his parents when he was a child. He was engaged at age 13 to Jashodaben, marrying her when he was 18. They spent little time together and grew apart when Modi began two years of travel, including visits to Hindu ashrams.[26][283] Reportedly, their marriage was never consummated, and he kept it a secret because otherwise he could not have become a 'pracharak' in the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.[284][53] Modi kept his marriage secret for most of his career. He acknowledged his wife for the first time when he filed his nomination for the 2014 general elections.[285][286] Modi maintains a close relationship with his mother, Hiraben.[287]\n A vegetarian and teetotaler,[288][289] Modi has a frugal lifestyle and is a workaholic and introvert.[290] Modi's 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with citizens on a live chat.[291][292] Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, as well as for a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism.[293][294][295] Modi's personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic.[13][296]\n He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji (\"Guru worthy of worship\").[297] According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.[298]\n The nomination of Modi for the prime ministership drew attention to his reputation as \"one of contemporary India's most controversial and divisive politicians.\"[156][299][300][301] During the 2014 election campaign the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader, who would be able to take difficult decisions.[156][169][171][175][176] Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, in a manner unusual for the BJP and RSS.[171] Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and \"development\".[302] Nonetheless, his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy.[6] Modi's hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[6][13][129][171]\n Modi interacting with the school children after delivering his address on Independence Day in New Delhi, 15 August 2017 As a Prime Minister, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings; at the end of his first year in office, he received an overall approval rating of 87% in a Pew Research poll, with 68% of people rating him \"very favorably\" and 93% approving of his government.[303] His approval rating remained largely consistent at around 74% through his second year in office, according to a nationwide poll conducted by instaVaani.[304] At the end of his second year in office, an updated Pew Research poll showed Modi continued to receive high overall approval ratings of 81%, with 57% of those polled rating him \"very favorably.\"[305][306] At the end of his third year in office, a further Pew Research poll showed Modi with an overall approval rating of 88%, his highest yet, with 69% of people polled rating him \"very favorably.\"[307] A poll conducted by The Times of India in May 2017 showed 77% of the respondents rated Modi as \"very good\" and \"good\".[308] In early 2017, a survey from Pew Research Center showed Modi to be the most popular figure in Indian politics.[309]\n Modi was named the Best Chief Minister in a 2007 nationwide survey by India Today.[310] In March 2012, he appeared on the cover of the Asian edition of Time Magazine, one of the few Indian politicians to have done so.[311] He was awarded Indian of the Year by CNN-IBN news network in 2014.[312] In 2014, 2015 and 2017, he was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World.[313][314][315] He was also declared winner of the Time magazine reader's poll for Person of the Year in 2014 and 2016.[316][317] Forbes Magazine ranked him the 15th Most Powerful Person in the World in 2014 and the 9th Most Powerful Person in the World in 2015, 2016 and 2018.[318][319][320][321] In 2015, Modi was ranked the 13th Most Influential Person in the World by Bloomberg Markets Magazine.[322] Modi was ranked fifth on Fortune Magazine's first annual list of the \"World's Greatest Leaders\" in 2015.[323][324] In 2017, Gallup International Association (GIA) conducted a poll and ranked Modi as third top leader of the world.[325][326][327] In 2016, a wax statue of Modi was unveiled at Madame Tussaud Wax Museum in London.[328][329]\n In 2015 he was named one of Time's \"30 Most Influential People on the Internet\" as the second-most-followed politician on Twitter and Facebook.[330] In 2018 he was the third most followed world leader on Twitter,[331] and the most followed world leader on Facebook and Instagram.[332][333] In October 2018, Modi received UN's highest environmental award, the 'Champions of the Earth', for policy leadership by \"pioneering work in championing\" the International Solar Alliance and \"new areas of levels of cooperation on environmental action\".[334][335][336] He was conferred the 2018 Seoul Peace Prize in recognition of his dedication to improving international co-operation, raising global economic growth, accelerating the Human Development of the people of India by fostering economic growth and furthering the development of democracy through anti-corruption and social integration efforts. He is the first Indian to win the award.[337] In January 2019, PM Narendra Modi, a biographic film starring Vivek Oberoi as Modi, was announced.[338]\n Following his second swearing-in ceremony as Prime Minister of India, a picture of Modi was displayed on the facade of the ADNOC building in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.[339] Premiered on 12 August 2019, Modi appeared in a special episode of Discovery Channel's show Man vs Wild with the host Bear Grylls,[340] becoming the second world leader after Barack Obama to appear in the adventure/survival show.[341] In the show he trekked the jungles and talked about nature and wildlife conservation with Grylls.[342] The episode was shot in Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand and was broadcast in 180 countries along India.[343] The Texas India Forum hosted a community event in honour of Modi on 22 September 2019 at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. The event was attended by over 50,000 people and several American politicians including President Donald Trump, making it the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the United States other than the Pope.[344][345] At the same event, Modi was presented with the Key to the City of Houston by Mayor Sylvester Turner.[346] He was awarded the Global Goalkeeper Award Award on 24 September 2019 in New York City by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in recognition for the Swachh Bharat Mission and \"the progress India has made in providing safe sanitation under his leadership\".[347][348]\n \n"], "https://www.pavitrajyotish.com/article/narendra-damodardas-modi/": [" Talk Ask Career Love Marriage Finance Education Personal Transit Ask Expert Remedies Offers \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 Talk Career Love Marriage Finance Education Personal Transit Ask Expert Remedies Offers Home \u00bb Articles \u00bb Politics \u00bb Narendra Damodardas Modi Horoscope   Introduction of Narendra Damodardas Modi Narendra Damodardas Modi is an Indian politician currently serving as the 14th Prime Minister of India. He is arguably some of the most influential, powerful, distinguished and charismatic leaders in the world today. Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati family of Damodardas Mulchand Modi and Hiraben Modi in Vadnagar in the Indian state of Gujarat. According to a caste-wise description of his individuality, Narendra Modi belongs to a community categorized as the Other Backward Class by the government of India. During childhood, Modi lent a helping hand to his father in selling tea at the Vadnagar railway station and later opened a tea stall himself with his brother at a place close to a bus terminus. He did his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in the year 1967 under an atmosphere wherein he was termed as an average student but with keen interest in theatre and debate. He came to know of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) at the merely eight years of his age and took an active part in its training session which later favored him into becoming a junior cadet in the RSS after being inducted by LakshmanraoInamdaraka VakilSaheb who also became Modi\u2019spolitical mentor. Modi married to JashodabenChimanlal when he was a teenager but could not adhere to the marital obligations as ingrained in the societal custom and so he left home thus living a non-married life, something Modi never mentioned in his public pronouncements for several decades until he came to power in Center as a PM and declared his marital tie with MsChimanlal. Quoting Vivekananda as the source of influence in his life, Narendra Modi dedicated his life to politics with a firm obligation of serving the motherland of India, a vow still upheld by him. Modi was a general secretary of Gujarat LokSangharshSamiti during a state of emergency enforced by the then government of Indira Gandhi in 1975. It was a time when the RSS committee was banned as a result of the enforced emergency and so, Modi was compelled to go underground and lived his life in disguise to avoid being arrested. He also provided sanctuary to the people wanted by the government and arranged financial supports for political refugees and activists. He also authored a book written in Gujarati, Sangharsh Ma Gujarat\u2013 talking at length about the events that took place during the state of emergency in India. In 1978 Modi was made a regional organizer of RSS monitoring the activities of the party in the regions of Surat and Vadodara but later he was transferred to Delhi and was assigned to write the history of the Emergency in the version of RSS. He came back to Gujarat in 1985 wherein RSS assigned him to Bharatiya Janata Party for which he organized a successful campaign for Ahmedabad municipal election thus helping the BJP to win the election easily. His contribution in helping BJP win the Ahmedabad election did not go unnoticed and he was rewarded later by being elected the organizing secretary of the party\u2019s Gujarat unit in 1987. His fame in BJP kept rising and while being a member of National Election Committee of BJP, Modi organized Ram RathYatra for L.KAdvani in 1990 and EktaYatra(1991-1992) for Murli Manohar Joshi. After having taken a political hiatus in 1992 he was insisted by Advani to come back and so Modi devised a successful electoral strategy as a BJP secretary in 1994 on the premise of which the party won the state assembly elections held in 1995. His phenomenal contributions within the BJP in scripting victory for the party had finally helped Modi become the general secretary of the BJP in 1988. Narendra Modi became the Chief Minister of Gujarat on October 7, 2001 after Keshubhai Patel whose political standing was tattered by a row of allegations concerning abuse of power, corruption and poor governance in the state of Gujarat and so Modi was opted for as an efficient replacement for Patel to become the CM of Gujarat. The name of Narendra Modi courted controversy post the felonious Gujarat riots in 2002 which claimed nearly 2000 lives as estimated by some independent sources. He, however, was acquitted of all charges and allegation of having his power abused into abetting the riots by the Indian Supreme Court triggering a reaction of furor nationwide demanding resignation of Modi as a CM. However, despite the allegations and assumptions about his alleged role in Gujarat riots, Modi won the 2002 state assembly election and was sworn in for second term as a CM of Gujarat. Several years later Modi, as a BJP prime ministerial candidate for 2014 general election and was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on May 26, 2014, thus becoming the first PM born after India\u2019s Independence from the British Empire. Modi-led state government in Gujarat had built total of 500,000 structures out of which 113,738 were check dams dedicated to powering up the aquifiers thus helping regain normal groundwater levels by 2010. As a result, it expedited the production of genetically modified cotton in the state, thus making it become the largest in India. His government in Gujarat revolutionized power distribution benefiting the farmers largely. The JyotigramYojana scheme was expanded to fuel up agricultural electricity to meet up irrigation demands for farmers. The state witnessed high rate of economic growth in1990\u2019s, scored higher point by World Bank in terms of ease of doing business, simplified taxation rules for businesses and created special economic zone among other initiatives to make Gujarat more investment-friendly destination for businesses. As a Narendra Damodardas Modi, Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister of India-led government implemented NITI Aayog after abolishing the Planning Commission. 1,200 obsolete laws were repelled in the first three years of his governance, launched Digital India programme, liberalized India\u2019s FDI policies, launched in September 2014 the Make In India initiative to turn the country into a global manufacturing hub, implemented the biggest tax reform known as GST (Goods and Services Tax) in India, demonetized banknotes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 from legal tender in 2016 to curb the counterfeit currency and terrorism in the country, and launched Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) to encourage nationwide cleanliness. Other initiatives launched by his government include rural electrification, free LPG Cylinders under the UjjwalaYojana scheme, Housing For All by 2022, Ayushman Bharat Yojana, Jan DhanYojana \u201cJAM\u201d, and so on. During his governance in center, the foreign relationship of India with other countries, including America, Japan and Russia was reinforced, as well as his strategic diplomacy with China also drew appreciation of his government\u2019s foreign policy. It is his government that retorted Pakistan\u2019s exporting terrorism to India with surgical strike, a move hailed unprecedented, considering India\u2019s conventional stand of not attacking any country first. The galvanized responses of the nationwide public and some foreign countries went in favor of Modi government. Narendra Modi is the recipient of various awards and recognitions, including Best CM in 2007 by India Today, Indian of the Year award by CNN-IBN, the award of 100 most influential people in the world by Time Magazine, the award of the 15th-Most-Powerful Person in the World in 2014 by Forbes Magazine, and the award of World\u2019s Greatest Leaders\u201d in 2015 by Fortune Magazine. He is the second-most-followed politician on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and the most followed world leader on Facebook and Instagram. His biographic movie, PM Narendra Modi starring Vivek Oberoi is soon to be launched. Pm Modi is the world\u2019s one of the most influential leaders and he enjoys quite a pervasive reputation in India as being the most ubiquitous media personality. He launched several flagship projects helping India to run faster on development trajectory on the front of agriculture, electricity and infrastructure. Under his governance, India rose to a phenomenal global reputation of being a powerful nation. Though his governance courted certain controversies, including about GST and demonetization, yet Modi emerged triumphant from all the flaks his government had to go through over the past four years. With Exit Polls of almost all media outlets predicting Modi returning to power in center again in the Lok Sabha Election of 2019, it goes without saying that the praise of him being the charismatic leader is not groundless and that the public of the nation believes in the integrity of what Modi government can deliver. His ability to understand the pulse of the nation is one of the finest differentiators of him as a politician which separates Modi from the rest of other leaders in India. Birth Details of Narendra Damodardas Modi are as per given below: Date of Birth: September 17, 1950, Birth Day: Sunday, Birth Time: 11:00:00, Birth Place: Vadnagar, Gujarat, India  Astrological Details of Kundli: Narendra Modi was born under Scorpio ascendant where debilitated Moon and swagruhi Mars are posited together thereby creating strong and power Chandra-Mangal Yoga. Saturn is combusted, Jupiter is retrograde and Mercury is exalted, retrograde and combusted. Natural benefic and also functional benefic (in NaMo chart\u2019s) Jupiter is passing through over his natal Moon and Mars and transiting through the 1st house i.e. Scorpio. Natal Moon is placed in Scorpio. Karmic teacher and hard task master Saturn is passing through the 2nd house in the sign of Sagittarius from his ascendant. Malefic nodes Rahu and Ketu are passing through 8th and 2nd house i.e. Gemini and Sagittarius Zodiac Sign in the natal chart of Modi. He is passing through the last phase of Sade-Sati and going through Moon Mahadasha. His birth star is \u2018Anuradha\u2019 which is governed by planet Saturn. It goes without saying that the transit of Jupiter will go down as highly opportune and favourable for him to get the blessing from preceptor, Guru. Rahu and Ketu transit may remain slightly negative in terms of his health as his hectic life style may take a toll on his health although nothing major or fatal is foreseen. Saturn\u2019s transit is going to remain good for Modi despite he is undergoing last phase of Sade Sati. Impact of Ascendent: People with Scorpio rising tend to be secretive, deep, withdrawn, mysterious, regenerate or degenerate, reserved, hard to understand, courageous, willful, persistent, stubborn in thought, creative, self-reliant, self-controlled (except perhaps with the passions), and silent. It represents the battleground where the higher and lower selves must come to mortal combat. Physical, emotional, mental and spiritual levels are all involved. People born in this specific ascendant emerge as great leaders and pioneers. Impact of the Moon Sign: People born under Scorpio Moon or lunar sign tend to appear calm on the surface, but can be extremely emotional inside. \u201cStill waters run deep\u201d, as they say. They tend to be the silent type, always wanting to know others\u2019 motivations, but never disclosing their own. They have great determination and strength, enough to overcome any adversary even themselves. The present of Chandra-Mangal Yoga catapulted Mr. Modi to a great political height and Mars in its own sign or house gives him raw pluck and charisma to take on his adversaries. The Mars is in its own sign Scorpio in his chart. He is very fervent, dedicated and determined person. He has a strong will and discipline in life. He had a very firm and stable mind. He tends to be secretive and keep his emotions hidden from others. He can manipulate others without hurting them or letting them know. Mars gives Martian nature and temperament. He has very tenacious memory. Power for him is very important and he is conscious if someone tries to overtake his position. Gaja Kesari Yoga: This is an auspicious yoga in Modi\u2019s birth chart. This yoga bestows wealth, luck and overall prosperity and knowledge. This yoga also protects an individual and eradicates any adverse effect of other malefic planets in any natal chart. Mercury in exaltation sign: The Mercury is exalted in his chart. He believes in perfection and he possesses a logical and analytical approach towards work which requires detailed attention and effective organization. He is practical and down to earth. His strength is clear thinking process, careful and mastery of technical skills. He is methodical, adaptable, stable, flexible and good with details. He is intelligent, have an analytical rational mind and take things seriously. Shani-Shukra Yoga: Both Saturn and Venus are considered as friends and their combination creates a stalwart individual and helps one to have firm grip on sensuous thought and lead a life of pious sage. One may acquire knowledge and discretion through application of common sense. This Yoga gives good sense of purpose and belonging altogether.

The Sade Sati will confer very good results as it is said that \u2018God help those who help themselves\u2019 therefore Modi will emerge as firm and resolute leader. \u00a0There are many positive Yogas present in the horoscope of Mr. Modi which will help him to outsmart his competitors and establish himself as undisputed leader among common masses. Saturn and Jupiter exchange of aspect creates Guru-Souri Yoga and it makes one sensible, aesthetic and pragmatic. Presence of Budha-Aditya Yoga will make him astute and highly intelligent to know every pros and cons. He will be aware of his own merits and demerits. He is undergoing Moon Mahadasha and Moon being engaged in Chandra-Mangal as well as Gaja-Keshari Yoga will make him popular leader and confer very positive results despite Moon being in its sign of debilitation. At present Ketu sub period or Bhukti is going on and this may make him slightly apprehensive about his future however he will have authority to trample all challenges and problems under his feet and march forward with elan and alacrity. His indomitable spirits ad undaunted guts will help him to establish his authority and powerful presence in his own party once again. The results for current parliamentary elections are to start pouring in from 23rd May. Planetary positions of the benefices, Jupiter (Guru) seem very supportive and god\u2019s special grace for Mr Narendra Modi to win in current parliamentary elections with huge margins. We have witnessed the just concluded 17th Lok Sabha election and election had been conducted in seven phases across India. It is the time for the Indian people to select their leader as Prime Minister who will remain at the helm for the next five years. If we analyze the current context of election vis-\u00e0-vis Modi\u2019s horoscope, we will notice that Mr. NaMo has very strong chance to get re-elected as Prime Minister for the second time. His party BJP is likely to emerge as single largest party among all parties. However, BJP may fall short slightly in getting the magic figure of 272+ however BJP is likely to increase its vote bank and tally considerably in untapped state like West Bengal, Orrisa and some south states. Irrespective of the outcome of different parties in the recently concluded general election in India, we can say that we can see Mr. Modi is taking oath for the second time as a Prime Minister because he will have the blessing of Guru, i.e. Jupiter notwithstanding the prevailing effects of Sade-Sati. We, Indians hope to see better and prosperous India under the astute and able leadership of Mr. Modi. India is likely to do well under NaMo\u2019s sagacious statesmanship in coming days.\u00a0 Congratulation!\u00a0 Modi Sahab\u2026 Read more Blogs: Bharatiya Janata Party\u00a0 and About Amit Shah Horoscope I know Pt Umesh Chandra and his esteemed astrology organisation Pavitra Jyotish Kendra last 6 years.

These sensors have become faster and more secure in recent times. As a result, these sensors are primarily used for smartphone security these days. \u00a0 The cutthroat competition in the smartphone industry and evolving technology has gotten us into that phase, where we come across a new innovation every other day. Fingerprint sensors have come a far away too, with the current buzzword being in-display fingerprint sensors. Smartphone manufacturers like Xiaomi, Realme and Oppo have made sure that the technology is not just limited to flagship devices. \u00a0 Recent devices like Realme X, Redmi K20 and OPPO K3 are offering in-display fingerprint scanners at a price that is hard to digest. With all that in mind, let's find out what is this in-display fingerprint sensor technology and how it works. \u00a0 Let\u2019s begin from the beginning when it all started. Diving into the history of fingerprint readers on Mobile devices takes us to the \u2018Pantech GI100\u2019, launched back in 2004. This device was equipped with a fingerprint reader, the first of its kind. The next devices following the trend \u2018G900 and G500\u2019 came from the likes of Toshiba in 2007. Later on manufacturers like HTC, Acer and Motorola joined the league with their respective devices. Apple too joined the party in 2013 with the iPhone 5s getting a fingerprint sensor. The Cupertino based giant called went on to call it Touch ID. Since then fingerprint sensor technologies have undergone some major changes.  \u00a0 Tech enthusiasts might know there are three different fingerprint authentication technologies in action. But the in-display fingerprint technology currently benefits only from the two. \u00a0 Before we get into the big picture lets us understand the basic technology in works behind. All fingerprint sensors work by tracking those unique tracking ridges and lines on your fingers. However, different technologies can be at work in this tracking process including optical scanning, capacitive scanning or ultrasonic scanning. \u00a0 \u00a0 Optical scanners have been around for quite a while now and are the oldest methods of fingerprint authentication. However, in-display optical sensors are comparatively new to smartphones. Vivo Apex, a concept device showcased at MWC 2018 turned many heads in the smartphone industry. The device featured \u2018CLEAR ID 9500\u2019, an optical fingerprint sensor developed by Synaptics, the US-based sensor maker. It was later brought to consumers in a new device called \u2018 Vivo X20 Plus UD\u2019. The new design was soon adopted by companies like OPPO, Samsung, Huawei and more. Most of the fingerprint sensor we see is Optical finger print sensor and they can be easily interfaced with Arduino, Raspberry pi and other microcontrollers.  \u00a0 Working of\u00a0Optical Fingerprint Sensor The technology relies on capturing an image of your fingerprint and further analysing if the current fingerprint matches the stored image. A charge-coupled device (CCD) sits at the heart of an optical sensor, the same sensor which is used in digital cameras and camcorders. For folks unaware, a CCD is an array of light-sensitive diodes called photosites, which generates electrical signals in response to light photons.  \u00a0 As soon as you place your finger on the sensor, an array of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) light up to illuminate the ridges and gaps and a CCD camera quickly captures an image of the same. The CCD system generates an inverted image of the finger, with darker areas representing more reflected light (the ridges of the finger) and lighter areas representing less reflected light (the valleys between the ridges). The image captured is then compared with the stored image. \u00a0 The optical sensors are easy to fool as the technology used captures a 2D image and a good quality image can possibly breakthrough this security. It is worth noting that the technology works only with OLED displays, where there are gaps in the backplane. Initially, in-display fingerprint sensors weren\u2019t as reliable and fast as they are now. But things have changed in favour of these sensors in recent times. \u00a0 Ultrasonic sensors are the newest of fingerprint technologies being used. As the name hints, these sensors make use of high-frequency ultrasonic sound to map your fingerprint. Samsung partnered with Qualcomm to bring the first device with an in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor the \u2018Galaxy S10/S10+. The device was also the first to feature Qualcomm\u2019s 3D Sonic sensor which is an iteration of Sense ID. \u00a0 Qualcomm\u2019s latest ultrasonic technology works through glass that\u2019s up to 800 microns thick. The company claims a 250-millisecond latency for unlocking which is close to what a capacitive fingerprint scanner can achieve.\u00a0  \u00a0 Working\u00a0of Ultrasonic Fingerprint Sensor The hardware on these scanners consists of an ultrasonic transmitter and receiver. Scanning process begins as soon as a fingertip is placed on the sensor. An ultrasonic pulse is transmitted by the transmitter which collides with the ridges and valleys on the fingertip, some of the pulse pressure is absorbed and some of it is bounced back to the sensor. The amount of absorption and bounce back of the pulse varies with varying fingerprints. Moving further, a sensor capable of detecting mechanical stress is used to calculate the intensity of the returning ultrasonic pulse at different points on the scanner. These scanners gain detailed in-depth information, resulting in a detailed 3D replica of the scanned fingerprint.  Since these scanners lie beneath the display. The waves from ultrasonic sensors have to travel through the display\u2019s backplane, glass, and protective cover before reaching your finger. Therefore, manufacturers ensure that the glass used for display is not too thick. Having said that, it is advised not to add extra protection such as a screen protector, which can prevent this technology from working properly. \u00a0 Not many devices come with an ultrasonic sensor being the costliest of available technologies. Flagship devices like Samsung Galaxy S10/10+ come equipped with an ultrasonic sensor. However, there\u2019s still some time until we see this technology penetrating the budget segment. \u00a0 Capacitive Sensors are the most widely used sensors these days and can be found on every other device that you come across. These sensors use capacitors as the core component, which is an electronic component used for storing electrical energy. The technology is not currently used for in-display fingerprint scanning. \u00a0 Working\u00a0of Capacitive Fingerprint Sensor These sensors too scan the ridges and valleys on fingerprints. However, in this case, electric current is used to collect data instead of light. An array of capacitors are placed below the scanning surface to collect fingerprint detail. When a fingertip is placed on the scanning surface the charge stored on the capacitor changes. This difference in charge is tracked by an op-amp integrator circuit which is further recorded by an analogue-to-digital converter.  \u00a0 The captured data is used for authentication. It is worth noting that the ability of capacitive sensors increases with the increase in no of capacitors. These scanners offer better security are fast and insanely difficult to be fooled. Capacitive sensors are costlier compared to optical ones and were used only in flagship devices back then. Moreover, this is 2019 and capacitive sensors have penetrated to all segments in the smartphone industry. Capacitive touch pads are cheap and can be easily integrated by any device. \u00a0 Scanning is just half the process, having said that it is important to store the data at a secure place. For this process, a dedicated IC is added to the sensor which deals with interpreting scanned data and further transmitting it to the processor. The secured place is inaccessible and even rooting cannot help to break in. Every manufacturer has a different approach and uses different algorithms to identify key fingerprint characteristics. Generally, these algorithms look for very specific features called minutiae, where the lines in your fingerprint terminate or split in two. Hence, the scanner can match these minutiae instead of scanning the whole fingerprint again. Which makes the whole process a tad bit faster.  \u00a0 Moving further, these sensor manufacturers have separate systems for storage. ARM uses, Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) based TrustZone technology which stores data in a secure place inside the main processor. Qualcomm on the other side uses Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment (QSEE) for securing private encryption keys and passwords. These systems might have different names but all of them have a common goal that is protecting data. \u00a0 Ultrasonic scanners of course are better as they benefit from the 3D scanning process, while optical scanners are just capable of 2D scanning as mentioned before. Besides these, ultrasonic sensors are extremely small in size, Qualcomm\u2019s latest 3D sonic sensor measures just 0.2 mm. The small form factor of these sensors meets the current demand for slim and bezel-less devices. Moving further, these sensors are also not affected by dust, grease or wet hands. \u00a0 However, there are not many devices which make use of ultrasonic sensors and that completely has to do with manufacturing costs. These sensors are costly and are available only on select devices flagship devices as of now. \u00a0 Well now that you are aware of the current technologies and their working. It would be even better if you are aware of the recent devices with in-display fingerprint sensors and their type.

VoLTE is a technology 4G LTE networks use to facilitate voice calls and text messages. VoLTE stands for Voice over LTE, and it is a managed-VoIP technology in 4G LTE networks that enables voice calls and text messages (SMS) through packet-switching. 2G and 3G networks use circuit-switching for voice calls and SMS, whereas LTE uses data to deliver all services, including voice and SMS. Voice calling is one of the most fundamental considerations when buying a mobile phone subscription. It is an essential service that mobile operators offer as part of their mobile phone solutions. If all VoLTE does is provide voice calls and SMS, do you wonder why it is such a big deal considering 2G and 3G networks have been delivering voice and texts for the last few decades? VoLTE or Voice over LTE is an IP-based technology introduced by the 4G LTE networks to deliver voice calls and text messages. 4G LTE networks are data-only and utilise mobile data to facilitate voice calls and texts instead of employing conventional calling technologies that 2G and 3G use. Conventional voice calling in 2G and 3G networks is based on circuit-switching (CS) technology. On the other hand, mobile internet in 2G and 3G networks requires packet-switching (PS) technology. As a data-only mobile network, 4G LTE uses packet-switching for all services, including voice, texts and the internet. When making a regular voice call from your mobile phone, the mobile network needs to communicate with external networks such as the landline network (Public Switched Telephone System \u2013 PSTN) or other local mobile networks (Public Land Mobile Network \u2013 PLMN). That requires the mobile network to be integrated with PSTN, which is how a mobile network connects your call to other landline or mobile numbers. On the other hand, internet-based voice calls such as WhatsApp do not require you to dial a phone number and rely on your phone number as a registration ID. Allowing customers to dial mobile or landline numbers through a cell phone requires integration with voice networks like PSTN or ISDN, which is achieved through circuit-switching in 2G and 3G. VoLTE allows packet-switched 4G LTE networks to integrate with voice networks like PSTN and ISDN. VoLTE requires a new network entity, IP Multimedia Subsystem or IMS, to work with the 4G mobile core network to enable rich communications services, including voice calling. IMS is not limited to 4G networks only and is also used by 5G to enable Voice over 5G. On your 4G LTE mobile phone, you may also see an inter-related technology, WiFi calling, that allows you to make traditional voice calls when connected to a WiFi network. WiFi calling is also called Voice over WiFi or VoWiFi, and it requires additional hardware. VoLTE uses IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and 4G LTE core network (Evolved Packet Core \u2013 EPC) to enable rich communication services, including voice calls and SMS in 4G and 5G NSA. VoLTE implementation also has a 2G/3G circuit-switched fallback (CSFB) as a backup for devices that don\u2019t support VoLTE. For Voice over LTE (VoLTE) to work, the key requirement is a packet-switched mobile core network and IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). 4G LTE networks are data-only and have a packet-switched core network, Evolved Packet Core or EPC. EPC works alongside another network entity, IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which provides the necessary integration with voice and multimedia networks. There are two critical conditions for VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling to work: first, the mobile device needs to be online, and secondly, it must be connected to the mobile core network. The second part is where the real magic happens. The in-built IMS architecture and the mobile core network take care of all the integrations with PSTN and other networks to enable voice calls through the internet in a secure manner.  VoLTE is a better option for customers and mobile operators for voice calls and SMS. For an operator, it is more efficient because the calls are not engaging any of their circuits, and for customers, the call is of better quality. In 2G GSM and 3G UMTS networks, there are two parts to the mobile core network: circuit-switched and packet-switched. Circuit-switched calls are not efficient and engage traditional circuits for the entire duration of a session, e.g. a phone call. LTE networks change that through VoLTE, but they still keep a 2G/3G fallback option so that if the network or device does not support VoLTE, voice calls and SMS can take place using circuit-switched technology. As soon as a VoLTE or VoWiFi enabled device is connected to the mobile network, the IMS infrastructure replicates what traditional circuit-switched calling would have done using packets of data instead of circuits. Therefore mobile operators have a cost for enabling the service, which is why the calls are chargeable.  In non-standalone 5G networks, 5G NSA, the communication takes place between the 5G radio network and the 4G LTE core network (EPC). Since both 4G LTE and 5G NSA use the EPC, the VoLTE capability exists in these cellular technologies. In standalone 5G (5G SA) with a dedicated 5G core network, an equivalent technology, Voice over 5G or Voice over NR, is used. Nowadays, mobile operators also have partnerships with fixed network providers for enabling Wi-Fi hotspots on specific mobile tariffs, which comes in handy for VoWiFi calls. Mobile Network Operators also have roaming agreements with mobile operators in other countries so that when customers travel to those countries, the partner networks can enable connectivity for them. WiFi calling, also known as Voice over WiFi, is not the same as VoLTE, but it is an inter-related technology that allows WiFi-connected cellular devices to become part of a 4G LTE network. For integrating Wi-Fi networks to a mobile network, an entity, Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG), is used.  ePDG establishes a secure connection with the WiFi connected cellular devices using IPsec. IPsec stands for Internet Protocol Security and is a suite of protocols used for encrypting data packets. This way, ePDG becomes an integral part of the overall 4G mobile core network, the EPC to extend the network coverage by taking advantage of the WiFi networks.  Both VoLTE and VoWiFi use the same mobile core network to provide a high-quality audio/video calling experience to customers. As a customer, you can make phone calls to landline numbers or other mobile numbers as normal as long as you are connected to a WiFi network. It is an excellent service for those who live in areas with poor cellular coverage or who often use underground train services like Tube or Metro.  VoLTE is the future of voice calling, and 5G New Radio (NR) networks follow the same approach. It evolves voice calls from conventional circuit-based calling to IP-based calling. VoLTE offers you a high-quality voice service without relying on 2G or 3G networks unless your device or network does not support it. When LTE networks were launched as part of 3GPP Release 8, the main LTE driver for the customers was a higher data rate than 2G/3G networks. The 2G and 3G mobile networks had two different parts of the network operating within them; one for voice calls and SMS, and the other for all things data. Since moving conventional voice calling to IP was a big step, especially in the beginning when 2G and 3G networks were still more widely available than 4G, LTE networks had an interim technology called circuit-switched fallback (CSFB). CSFB is the capability of LTE networks to use 2G and 3G networks for voice calls and SMS. So, for example, if you have a 4G phone and a SIM, CSFB allows you to make phone calls as normal, but in the background, it will be using 2G (e.g. GSM) or 3G (e.g. UMTS) networks.  What VoLTE does is that it takes away that dependency on 2G and 3G networks so that if you are in an area where you only have 4G or 5G network coverage, you can still make voice calls. And not just that, VoLTE is capable of providing a better and more crisp calling experience and is also more power-efficient than other VoIP services.   Generally, there are no extra charges for VoLTE, and the calling minutes come out of your standard calling allowance. So, for example, if you have 500 calling minutes as part of your monthly allowance, the minutes you use for VoLTE calling will come out of those 500 minutes, just like any non-VoLTE calls.  Also, even though VoLTE uses the packet-switched part of the network, which is data-only, any data that VoLTE consumes does not come out of your monthly data allowance because mobile operators charge for it as calling minutes not data.  However, you must always check with your mobile operator to avoid any bill shocks if you are unclear. Each operator\u2019s business and pricing model can differ, so you should speak to your mobile operator, especially if you plan to use any of the services abroad.  There is no reason for not having the VoLTE feature enabled (switched on) on your mobile phone. Since VoLTE also has a circuit-switched fallback option (CSFB), if your mobile network or device does not support VoLTE, you can still make and receive phone calls through the circuit-switched 2G or 3G networks. With 2G/3G circuit-switched fallback, if you are in a geographical location where your mobile operator does not have VoLTE support or if you have an older phone that is not VoLTE-compatible, you may still make and receive calls through 2G GSM or 3G UMTS networks. When travelling abroad, you may want to check with your mobile operator if there are any extra charges for using VoLTE or VoWiFi when roaming. To avoid bill shock, you can use a spend-cap to take control of any such unforeseen costs. If you switch off WiFi calling or VoLTE, you will still be able to use your phone for conventional circuit-switched calling on 2G/3G networks.  Not all phones show a symbol on top of your phone screen when VoLTE is enabled, but it is possible to turn VoLTE off on your phone. If you want to do that, generally, you can find the VoLTE tab by going to \u201cSettings\u201d and then \u201cMobile Data\u201d or \u201cMobile Networks\u201d tab. Below are some screenshots and guidance to help you do that for iPhone and some Android phones: To turn off VoLTE on an iPhone, you need to go to Settings->Mobile Data->Mobile Data Options->Voice & Data. That will take you to the tab where you can use a slide button to enable/disable VoLTE.    You will likely find the VoLTE option on Andriod phones under the \u201cMobile Networks\u201d tab. An example below for a Samsung phone: To turn off VoLTE, go to: Settings->Connections->Mobile networks. That will take you to the following tab so you can enable/disable VoLTE: VoLTE or Voice over LTE is a fourth-generation (4G) technology that enables voice calls and SMS over 4G LTE networks. In the absence of VoLTE, the only way 4G networks can facilitate voice calls is by using a 2G/3G fallback option called Circuit-Switched Fallback (CSFB), which utilises legacy networks (2G/3G) for voice calls. VoLTE is a packet-switched technology enabled by IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) in mobile networks. It relies on data packets instead of conventional circuits to make voice calls and send text messages (SMS). VoLTE requires the 4G LTE core network (EPC) to support voice calls and SMS in both 4G LTE and non-standalone 5G NR networks. Some key features and benefits of VoLTE: Thank you for reading this post.

Manufacturers nowadays prefer to use SSD in place of HDD because of the enormous benefits in speed. \n\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n\n If you consider gamers for example, they prefer to use also SSD in their PC desktop gaming computers, so the trend is not only on Laptops. When a user runs an application residing on an SSD drive, the results in speed increase are immediately noticeable. The hard disc drive (HDD) is the modern computer\u2019s bottleneck. To boost your system\u2019s speed, you can replace the storage with SSD as it has a much faster read/write speed performance compared to traditional HDD. To compare the two storage technologies, an SSD writes data up to 20 times faster and reads data up to 10 times faster than a mechanical HDD. For most laptop or desktop computer users, a 512 GB SSD is sufficient. It provides enough speed and storage to simultaneously load applications or play games. Keep in mind though that when the space on your SSD reaches around 75% capacity or more, its performance (and hence your computer\u2019s performance) will begin to slow down. So, getting an SSD with enough storage space is essential. In the market we usually see SSD drives in the range of 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB capacity sizes. In this article we will compare the last two types, i.e 512GB vs 1TB SSD drives. The quick comparison between the two SSD capacity sizes is as following: 1TB of SSD storage space is the best choice if you are looking to store large sized videos or millions of photos, and also for hard-core gamers that store many large games on their local PC. However, if you are a regular user with maybe casual gaming activities etc, then 512GB SSD will be more than enough for you. Table of Contents One of the best spec combinations you can get for daily use of a general-purpose laptop or desktop computer is 512 GB SSD together with a decent CPU (Intel i5 or Ryzen5 and above) and at least 8GB RAM. This setup provides fast speed and storage and will support the operations of most users. If you have a laptop, a 512GB SSD is an excellent choice. For starters, it\u2019s a great all-around storage device that can handle just about anything. On the other hand, if you are a professional who does video or photo editing, multimedia processing etc, then 1TB SSD is the best choice. Moreover, for hard-core gamers, you\u2019ll have enough storage space for your operating system and to load more games with a 1TB SSD as well. Overall, the 1TB SSD can be used if you don\u2019t care about budget and just want plenty of space to support your computer usage. Of course, the cost between 512GB and 1TB SSD is one factor to take into account when comparing the two options. Keep in mind though that SSD prices have dropped significantly over the past years and are going on a decreasing trajectory in the future as well. The average price of a good-quality 512 GB SSD in the market is around $50-$100. So, users can choose this option if they can compromise on space. Moreover, we suggest to get a PCIe NVME interface type which is much faster than SATA III. On the other hand, the average price of 1TB SSD is around \u00a0$90-$150. This is the actual amount in which you can go for a good SSD drive having exceptional specs. To get a reliable SSD product, we suggest to shop from one of the well-known SSD vendors out there. In this section, we will tell you guys some top SSD models that users can choose for very good performance for their systems. If you are looking for a great all-purpose 2.5-inch 1TB SSD drive that can perform really well with solid reliability and keep your system working flawlessly, then this is one of the best options for you. Although it is a little bit expensive, people who want to go with branded SSD can\u2019s go wrong with a Samsung brand. The maximum sequential read of this SSD is 560 MBps. Moreover, you also get a three-year warranty from the company so users never need to worry about this amazing brand. The users who need a fast NVMe M.2 SSD drive on a budget price can go for this product option. You all need to give it a try as it gives you amazing features at a low price. The maximum sequential read of this SSD is 3400 MB/s and comes in capacities from 256GB up to 2TB. Not only this, but it also provides you with a 5 years warranty. Another very good SSD brand, this Western Digital internal SSD drive is great for gamers. With its built-in heatsink, it can withstand extreme temperatures for demanding gaming and other applications. It is more expensive than other models however. It comes in capacities of 500GB up to 2TB. Many people ask this question often, wondering if a 512GB SSD disk will be enough for their storage needs. Keep in mind that a 512GB disk used as the main C: Drive (i.e the Operating System drive) will have free space of around 400GB or less since several gigabytes are already consumed by the Operating System (e.g Windows or MAC) and the various software installed on the computer (e.g office, browsers, antivirus etc). So, a 512GB SSD drive (used as the single main storage disk of the computer) will offer you around 400GB of available storage space. For many regular users this storage space is more than enough. If you are a user that does office work, browsing, gaming etc then 512GB disk is enough. Now, if you are a heavy power user and gamer that wants to download and store large games locally on the computer or you do heavy multi-media work (video editing, photo editing, storage of all these media files locally etc), then 512GB will NOT be enough. For such cases, its better to get a computer with 1TB SSD. In summary, two of the most popular SSD capacity sizes for modern computers are 512GB and 1TB SSD drives. Choose a 512GB SSD if you are a regular computer user with casual gaming activities and just want a budget option which however will be a great middle-ground between the smaller 256GB and the higher 1TB capacities. Choose 1TB SSD size if you are a professional in the multimedia industry (video editing, 3D animations, photo editing etc) or if you are a person with heavy storage needs.

He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Modi, a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is a Hindu nationalist and member of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Born to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child, and later ran his own stall. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. He left home after graduating from school, partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected. Modi traveled around India for two years, and visited a number of religious centres. He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary. Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots, or otherwise criticised for its handling of it, although a court found no evidence to prosecute Modi. His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise. His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education indices in the state. Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election, which gave the party a majority in the Lok Sabha, the first time a single party had achieved this since 1984. Modi himself was elected to parliament from Varanasi. Since taking office, Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, increased spending on infrastructure, and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy, and centralised power through the abolition of the Planning Commission. He has begun a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Credited with engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda. Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c.1915 - 1989) and Hiraben Modi (born c.1920). Modi's family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community, which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government. As a child, Modi helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus. Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, with an interest in theatre. Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and this was noted by his teachers and students. Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image. When eight years old, Modi discovered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) for RSS and became his political mentor. While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980. Engaged while still a child to Jashodaben, a girl from a family who lived close by, Modi rejected the arranged marriage at the same time he graduated from high school. The resulting familial tensions contributed to his decision to leave home in 1967. Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he went have emerged. In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education. Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi's life. In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which Modi wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati. Modi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968\u201369. Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad. There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation. In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city. After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS, working under Inamdar. Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him. Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001. In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from School of Open Learning at University of Delhi, graduating with a third class. Five years later, in 1982, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University, as an external distance learning student. In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as \"The Emergency\", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned. Modi was appointed general secretary of the \"Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\", an RSS committee coordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned. Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations. Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists. During this period, Modi wrote a book in Gujarati, Sangharsh MA Gujarat (In The Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency. Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes, as well as several other national political figures. In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a Sikh. Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency. He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers. After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987. Modi rose within the party and was named a member of the BJP's National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise L. K. Advani's 1990 Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991\u201392 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity). However, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in Ahmedabad; friction with Shankersingh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played a part in this decision. Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani, and as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state Assembly elections. In November of that year Modi was elected BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections. Modi, on the selection committee for the 1998 Assembly elections in Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as key to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections, and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year. In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001. The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement. Although BJP leader L. K. Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was \"going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all\". On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections. On 7 October 2001, Modi was administered the oath of office. On 24 February 2002 he entered the Gujarat state legislature by winning a by-election to the Rajkot \u2013 II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC by 14,728 votes, which enabled him to take office. On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people. The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid. In making a public statement after the incident, Modi said that the attack had been terror attack planned by local Muslims. The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh across the state. Riots began during the bandh, and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat. The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence. The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed. Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000. Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps. Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women. The government of Gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots, and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation. Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom, while others have called it an example of state terrorism. Summarising academic views on the subject, Martha Nussbaum said: \"There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law.\" The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating. The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh, despite such actions being illegal at the time. State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there. Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court. During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able. In 2012 Maya Kodnani, a minister in Modi's government from 2007 to 2009, was convicted of participation in the Naroda Patiya massacre during the 2002 riots. Although Modi's government had announced that it would seek the death penalty for Kodnani on appeal, it reversed its decision in 2013. Modi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, Modi said that \"What is happening is a chain of action and reaction.\" Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode. Modi has not offered an apology for the riots. In March 2008, the Supreme Court reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue. In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri (widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre), in April 2009 the court also asked the SIT to investigate the issue of Modi's complicity in the killings. The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him. In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT's position, he said that Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence. The Supreme Court gave the matter to the magistrate's court. The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jaffri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013 the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister. In the aftermath of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue. Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted. His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved. Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002. In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly. Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign, and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters. Modi hired the public relations firm APCO Worldwide to manage his image. He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 1,13,589 of 1,54,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes. On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term. Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly. During Modi's second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development. Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP. Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a forward to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies. Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister) distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots. Questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed under the aegis of the International Religious Freedom Act, the only person denied a US visa under this law. The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington. During the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism. In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \"\u00a0for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a \"spiritual experience\" for Dalits. However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct. After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat's 1,600-kilometre (990\u00a0mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats. In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post, and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election. As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth \u20b96.6\u00a0trillion were signed. The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them. Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010. As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India. The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4\u20136% of the area intended. Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent \u2013 the highest of any state. However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992\u201397 INC government was 12.9 percent. In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata's to Gujarat. The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed. Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised, according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers. There has been a contentious debate surrounding the development of the state of Gujarat during Modi's tenure as chief minister. The GDP growth rate of Gujarat averaged 10% during Modi's tenure, a value above that of the country as a whole, and similar to other highly industrialised states. Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office. Some scholars have stated the rate of growth did not accelerate during Modi's tenure, although the state is considered to have maintained a high growth rate during Modi's Chief Ministership. Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank's \"ease of doing business\" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years. In 2013, Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for \"economic freedom\" by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states. In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism. Tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states, as was land. Modi's policies to make Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones, where labour laws were greatly weakened. Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the \"alarming\" category on the India State Hunger Index. A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found that Gujarat under Modi had a poor record with respect to immunisation in children. Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states. It showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined. With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below most Indian states. The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits, and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities. Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index. Political Scientist Christophe Jaffrelot says that under Modi the number of families below the poverty line has increased and conditions for rural adivasi and dalits, in particular, have declined. Under Modi, the state government spent far less than the national average on education and healthcare. In July 2013, economics Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen expressed disapproval of Modi's governance record, saying that under his administration Gujarat's \"record in education and healthcare is pretty bad\". However, economists Arvind Panagariya and Jagdish Bhagwati say that Gujarat's social indicators have improved from a lower baseline than that of other Indian states. According to them, Gujarat's performance in raising literacy rates has been superior to other states and the \"rapid\" improvement of health indicators is evidence that \"its progress has not been poor by any means.\" During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India. Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders. He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra. His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012. He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji (\"Guru worthy of worship\"). According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children. While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people, something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt. The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995). In later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates. In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests by Indian-Americans. After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014. Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister. In September 2013 Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modi's candidature, including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were \"concerned with their personal agendas\". Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's election campaign. Several people who voted for the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party. The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign. The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi. During the campaign, Modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous INC government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat. Modi projected himself as a person who could bring about \"development,\" without focus on any specific policies. His message found support among young Indians and among middle-class citizens. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism. Prior to the election Modi's image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, but during the campaign the BJP was able to shift this to a focus on Modi's neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development. Although the BJP avoided issues of Hindu nationalism to an extent, Hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign. The BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media. Modi's campaign blitz cost approximately \u20b950 billion (US$780\u00a0million), and received extensive financial support from corporate donors. In addition to more conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media, and addressed more than 1000 rallies via hologram appearances. The BJP won 31% of the vote, and more than doubled its tally in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984. Voter dissatisfaction with the INC, as well as with regional parties in North India, was another reason for the success of the BJP, as was the support from the RSS. In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before. It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims. The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the right-wing. Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism. Modi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies: Varanasi and Vadodara. He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi and Madhusudan Mistry of the INC in Vadodara by 570,128 votes. Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, was appointed prime minister by India's president. To comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat. Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014 at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. He became the first Prime Minister born after India's independence from the British Empire. His first cabinet consisted of 45 ministers, 25 fewer than the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. 21 new ministers were added to the council of ministers in November 2014. The economic policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, based on a neoliberal framework. Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other reforms included removing many of the country's labour laws, to make it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them. These reforms met with support from institutions such as the World Bank, but opposition from scholars within the country. The labour laws also drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the reforms would hurt labourers by making it easier for corporations to exploit them. In his first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised to gradually reduce the budgetary deficit from 4.1 percent to 3 percent over two years, and to divest from shares in public banks. Over Modi's first year in office, the Indian GDP grew at a rate of 7.5 percent, making it the world's fastest-growing large economy. The funds dedicated to poverty reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly decreased by the Modi administration. The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6% of GDP during the Congress government to 12.6% during Modi's first year in office. Spending on health and family welfare declined by 15%, and on primary and secondary education by 16%. The budgetary allocation for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, or the \"education for all\" programme, declined by 22%. The government also lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, and reduced customs duties on gold, jewelry, and increased sales taxes. In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices, and later increased taxes on diesel and petrol. In September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub. Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it. Under the previous bill, the government had required the consent of 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. Modi's government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017. On 25 June 2015, Modi launched a programme intended to develop 100 smart cities. The \"Smart Cities\" programme is expected to bring Information Technology companies an extra benefit of \u20b920 billion (US$310\u00a0million). In June 2015, Modi launched the \"Housing for All By 2022\" project, which intends to eliminate slums in India by building about 20 million affordable homes for India's urban poor. In his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate black money. On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised \u20b9500 and \u20b91000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism. The move led to widespread protests throughout the country, including one by opposition parties, which stalled the winter session of parliament. In the days following the demonetisation, banks across the country faced severe cash shortages, which had detrimental effects on a number of small businesses, on agriculture, and on transportation. People seeking to exchange their notes had lengthy waits, and several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash. Following Modi's announcement, the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 declined steeply. There has been a steep increase in digital payments and transactions in the country since the day demonetization was announced. Post the demonetisation, the quantum of income tax returns filed for individuals jumped by 25% indicating the widened tax net. Further, the advance tax collections rose by 42% and Self assessment tax collections rose by 34.25%. In his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the amount of money spent by the government on healthcare. The Modi government launched a \"New Health Policy\" in January 2015, although this did not increase the government's spending on healthcare, instead emphasizing the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including reducing child and maternal mortality rates. The National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices received nearly 25% less funds in 2015 than in the previous year. 15 national health programmes, including those aimed at controlling tobacco use and supporting healthcare for the elderly, were merged with the National Health Mission, and received less funds than in previous years. Modi initially appointed Harsh Vardhan, a doctor and an advocate of tobacco control, as minister of health. However, Vardhan was removed in November 2015. The government introduced stricter packaging laws for tobacco which requires 85% of the packet size to be covered by pictorial warnings. In its budget for the second year after it took office, the Modi government reduced healthcare spending by 15%. Modi has generally emphasised his government's efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health. An article in the medical journal Lancet stated that the country \"might have taken a few steps back in public health\" under Modi. On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (\"Clean India\") campaign. The stated goals of the campaign included eliminating open defecation and manual scavenging. The plan was to achieve these aims in five years. As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them. The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants. The administration plans to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the toilets constructed for them. During the 2014 election campaign, the BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders known to have opposed Hindu nationalism, including B. R. Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Ram Manohar Lohia. The campaign also saw the use of rhetoric based on Hindutva, however, by BJP leaders in certain states. Communal tensions were played upon especially in Uttar Pradesh and the states of Northeast India. A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code was a part of the BJP's election manifesto. Several state governments headed by the BJP have enacted policies aligned with Hindutva after the election of Modi as prime minister. The government of Maharashtra banned the killing of cows in 2014. The Modi administration has generally avoided directly supporting policies related to a Hindutva agenda. There has been an increase in the activities of a number of other Hindu nationalist organisations, sometimes with the support of the government. The incidents included a Hindu religious conversion programme, a campaign against the alleged Islamic practice of \"Love Jihad\", and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right wing Hindu Mahasabha. The attempts at religious conversion have been described by the VHP and other organisations involved with them as attempts at \"reconversion\" from Islam or Christianity. There have been a number of reports of intimidation or coercion of the subjects during these attempts. Officials in the government, including the Home Minister, have defended the attempts. There were additional incidents of violence targeted at religious minorities by Hindu nationalists. Modi refused to remove a government minister from her position after a popular outcry resulted from her referring to religious minorities as \"bastards.\" Commentators have suggested, however, that the violence was perpetrated by radical Hindu nationalists to undercut the authority of Modi. The Modi administration appointed Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR). In reaction to his appointment, other historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the ruling party, questioned his credentials as a historian. Several stated that the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism. The government began formulating a New Education Policy, or NEP, soon after its election. As of March 2016, this policy had yet to be implemented. This was the third education policy introduced by the Indian government, following those of 1968 and 1986. The policy was described as having overtones of Hindutva. The RSS had a role in its creation, and it did not explicitly mention the goals of \"socialism, secularism and democracy\" that had been mentioned in the first two policies. The policy emphasised the education of minority students, as well as those of economically backward groups, in particular on improving enrolment in schools among those groups. The policy proposed bringing religious educational institutions under the Right to Education Act. There was also a debate about removing caste-based reservation in favour of reservation based on income, a move supported by the RSS, but which was criticised as being discriminatory on the basis of caste. Foreign policy played a relatively small role in Modi's election campaign, and did not feature prominently in the BJP's election manifesto. Modi invited all the other leaders of SAARC countries to his swearing in ceremony as prime minister. He was the first Indian prime minister to do so. Modi's foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding INC government, focused on improving economic ties, security, and regional relations. Modi continued Manmohan Singh's policy of \"multialignment.\" The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially in East Asia, with the use of slogans such as \"Make in India\" and \"Digital India\". As a part of this policy, the Modi government completed India's application to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which is led by China and Russia. (SCO). The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as with Israel. Modi added five bilateral strategic partnerships to the 25 that had been agreed by his predecessors Singh and Vajpayee. During the first few months after the election, Modi made trips to a number of different countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits. One of Modi's first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid. Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country. While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries. In 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land exchange deal with Bangladesh about the India\u2013Bangladesh enclaves, which had been initiated by the government of Manmohan Singh. Modi's administration gave renewed attention to India's \"Look East Policy\", instituted in 1991. The policy was renamed the \"Act East Policy\", and involved directing Indian foreign policy towards East Asia and Southeast Asia. The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with Myanmar, through the state of Manipur. This represented a break with India's historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade. As of July 2016, Modi had made 51 trips to 42 countries with the intent of strengthening diplomatic relations. The BJP election manifesto had also promised to deal with illegal immigration into India in the Northeast, as well as to be more firm in its handling of insurgent groups. During the election campaign, Modi said that he would be willing to accommodate Hindu migrants who were being persecuted in Bangladesh, but those that came with \"political objectives\" would have to be sent back. The Modi government issued a notification allowing Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to legalise their residency in India. The government described the measure as being taken for humanitarian reasons but it drew criticism from several Assamese organisations. Modi continued the previous INC administration's policy of increasing military spending every year, announcing an increase of 11% in the military budget in 2015. This increase was larger than the average growth under the Congress. The Modi administration negotiated a peace agreement with the largest faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCM), which was announced in August 2015. The Naga insurgency in northwest India had begun in the 1950s. The NSCM and the government had agreed to a ceasefire in 1997, but a peace accord had not previously been signed. In 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the Khaplang faction of the NSCM (NSCM-K). The NSCM-K responded with a series of attacks, which killed 18 people. The Modi government carried out a raid across the border with Myanmar as a result, and labelled the NSCM-K a terrorist organisation. Modi has repeatedly stated that Pakistan was an exporter of terrorism. On 29 September 2016, the Indian Army stated that it had conducted a surgical strike on terror launchpads in Azad Kashmir, although Pakistan denied the claim, and the details of the confrontation are still in dispute. In naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the \"Ministry of Environment and Forests\" the \"Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change.\" In the first budget of the government, the money allotted to this ministry was reduced by more than 50%. The new ministry also removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection. These included no longer requiring clearance from the National Board for Wildlife for projects close to protected areas, and allowing certain projects to proceed before environmental clearance was received. The government also tried to reconstitute the Wildlife board such that it no longer had representatives from non-governmental organisations: however, this move was prevented by the Supreme Court. Modi also relaxed or abolished a number of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists. Under the UPA government that preceded Modi's administration, field trials of Genetically Modified (GM) crops had essentially been put on hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods. Under the Modi government these restrictions were gradually lifted. The government received some criticism for freezing the bank accounts of environmental group Greenpeace, citing financial irregularities, although a leaked government report said that the freeze had to do with Greenpeace's opposition to GM crops. Modi's first year as prime minister saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations. Modi's efforts at centralisation have been linked to an increase in the number of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary. On 31 December 2014, Modi announced that the Planning Commission had been scrapped. It was replaced with a body called the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog. The Planning Commission was a legacy of the Indian Independence movement, although critics said that it was slowing economic growth. The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister. It also reduced the extent of control individual states had over their financial allocation from the union government, and unlike the planning commission, it does not have the power to allocate funds. The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice. The Modi government launched a crackdown against a number of civil society organisations. Several tens of thousands of organisations were investigated by the Intelligence Bureau in the first year of the administration, on the grounds that they were slowing economic growth. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure. Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz. Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi's style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi. Modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister, against a total of 1,301 such laws repealed by previous governments over a span of 64 years. He started a monthly radio programme titled \"Mann Ki Baat\" on 3 October 2014. Modi also launched the Digital India programme, which has the goal of ensuring that government services are available electronically, building infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boosting manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promoting digital literacy. In accordance with Ghanchi tradition, Modi's marriage was arranged by his parents when he was a child. He was engaged at age 13 to Jashodaben, marrying her when he was 18. They spent little time together and grew apart when Modi began two years of travel, including visits to Hindu ashrams. Reportedly, their marriage was never consummated, and he kept it a secret because otherwise he could not have become a 'pracharak' in the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh. Although Modi kept his marriage secret for most of his career, he acknowledged his wife when he filed his nomination for a parliamentary seat in the 2014 general elections. Modi maintains a close relationship with his mother, Hiraben and often visits her on his birthday to seek her blessings. A vegetarian, Modi has a frugal lifestyle and is a workaholic and introvert. Adept at using social media, he has been since September 2014 the second-most-followed leader in the world (with over 25.8 million followers on Twitter as of December 2016), behind only Barack Obama. Modi's 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with netizens on live chat. Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, as well as for a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. Modi's personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic. The nomination of Modi for the prime ministership drew attention to his reputation as \"one of contemporary India's most controversial and divisive politicians.\" During the 2014 election campaign the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader, who would be able to take difficult decisions. Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, in a manner unusual for the BJP and RSS. Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and \"development\". Nonetheless, his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy. Modi's hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda. As prime minister, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings; at the end of his first year in office, he received an overall approval rating of 87% in a Pew Research poll, with 68% of people rating him \"very favorably\" and 93% approving of his government. His approval rating remained largely consistent at around 74% through his second year in office, according to a nationwide poll conducted by instaVaani. At the end of his second year in office, an updated Pew Research poll showed Modi continued to receive high overall approval ratings of 81%, with 57% of those polled rating him \"very favorably.\" At the end of his third year in office, The Times of India poll showed that 77% of the respondents rated him as \"very good\" and \"good\".  Modi was named the Best Chief Minister in a 2007 nationwide survey by India Today. In March 2012, he appeared on the cover of the Asian edition of Time Magazine, one of the few Indian politicians to have done so. He was awarded Indian of the Year by CNN-IBN news network in 2014. In 2014, 2015 and 2017, he was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World. He was also declared winner of the Time magazine reader's poll for Person of the Year in 2014, a feat which he repeated again in 2016. Forbes Magazine ranked him the 15th-Most-Powerful Person in the World in 2014 and the 9th-Most-Powerful Person in the World in 2015 and 2016. In 2015, Modi was ranked the 13th-Most-Influential Person in the World by Bloomberg Markets Magazine. In the same year he was named one of Time's \"30 Most Influential People on the Internet\" as the second-most-followed politician on Twitter and Facebook. Modi was ranked fifth on Fortune Magazine's first annual list of the \"World's Greatest Leaders\" in 2015. In 2016, a wax statue of Modi was unveiled at Madame Tussaud Wax Museum in London."], "https://vdocuments.net/voice-in-4g-csfb-voip-volte.html": [" Post on 21-Jan-2018 883 views Category: 4 download Embed Size (px)\n                            344 x 292429 x 357514 x 422599 x 487 TRANSCRIPT  Copyright \u00a9 2022 VDOCUMENTS"], "https://ams.com/ambient-light-sensors-proximity-detection": [" \nams supplies a family of products which combine an Ambient Light Sensor (ALS) and proximity detection in a single device.

The first generation, 1G worked on wireless technology which was used in phones. Initially, the network was based on the analog telecommunications standards and with the 2G rollout, it shifted the trend from the analog network to digital transmission.  The new tech addition in the phones not only changed phones network but also the browsing on WAP and sending SMS as well. With the 3G upgrade, the video calls, mobile TV, mobile internet access, and quality of wireless calls were improved. Coming to the present generation, there is a hype of 4G network in India. Although 4G is little late than the Western countries in India, at least we have our 4G network now.  When we are talking about 4G, the first thing comes in mind is Reliance Jio 4G network and why don\u2019t it as Jio is the only robust network which assists future development of 4G advancement in the country. 4G in India is highly dominated by reliance Jio which is utilizing its own 4G network and sharing limited spectrum with others.  From 3G to 4G, the network speed is improved a lot. In support of smartphone being more advanced concerning tech utilities and support for opening a desktop-class website in phones, it is also necessary to improve the network accordingly. Where 3G provides 5-20 Mbps of speeds, the 4G network is able to render 150 Mbps of speeds technically.  From 2G to 3G, the data speed was enhanced a lot and faster streaming and browsing came on trend. Even voice calls improved in a better way comparatively. With the 4G, changes are quite significant in voice calls comparing with 3G network. Read Also: 10 New Secret Smartphone Features that you may not know already The 4G network is offered by Jio and deals with IP based calling where call connects based on a data network. This is the real purpose of 4G but it is not compatible with existing network structure which is built on the 2G/3G network of Airtel and Vodafone. This magnification added a space for implementation of LTE+ which is termed as an advanced form of 4G version.  LTE(Long Term Evolution) refers to a 4G network and in certain countries, LTE+ is termed as LTE-A where A is for advanced. Basically, LTE+ is the advanced version of LTE with few changes which make LTE+ perform faster. LTE+ uses two bands to send data at the instant of time providing reduced congestion and better resultant speeds.  We are familiar with the fact that each new generation addition creates the older technology equipped phones incompatible. The result is the phone build with keeping 3G in mind, won\u2019t work with 4G network and can work if it has specific hardware in it. But with 4G, even your phone are 4G compatible there can be issues with compatibility.  India is offering 3 bands of 4G which includes 850 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 2300 MHz. The other band 700 MHz is kept safe for future use. In India, Jio has a license of 2300 MHz spectrum for PAN India purpose. As now 4G has some bands and maybe your phone doesn\u2019t support 2300 MHz band and it can make your phone incompatible with 4G. The new phones are upgraded with new techs but phones such as the Nexus 6 are not compatible with pre-Jio 4G networks in India. Have a look: Top 5 Video calling apps for distance calling VoLTE means Voice over LTE which renders unified format of voice traffic on LTE, and other systems as well. As Reliance Jio is the only network in India working over IP network, it has set VoLTE as standard which means all voice calls will be on the IP network like calling through the apps.  It also scales up the voice call experience as browsing and talking over the phone at the same time is possible now. With the 3G network, it is not possible to download and message through data services while talking on the phone and getting a call. This problem is sorted out with VoLTE addition. As per the telecom standard, VoLTE is the only source for delivering Voice services over LTE and VoLTE is meant to facilitate HD voice. This is the true sense of VoLTE and occupation of these services provide the True 4G experience.  This post has explained the meaning of 3G, 4G, LTE+, and VoLTE in detail and now it is sure when the talk will be about these tech topics, you won\u2019t be the one looking for the corner to hide in lack of knowledge about these trendy topics.

In support of smartphone being more advanced concerning tech utilities and support for opening a desktop-class website in phones, it is also necessary to improve the network accordingly. Where 3G provides 5-20 Mbps of speeds, the 4G network is able to render 150 Mbps of speeds technically.  From 2G to 3G, the data speed was enhanced a lot and faster streaming and browsing came on trend. Even voice calls improved in a better way comparatively. With the 4G, changes are quite significant in voice calls comparing with 3G network.

This is the real purpose of 4G but it is not compatible with existing network structure which is built on the 2G/3G network of Airtel and Vodafone. This magnification added a space for implementation of LTE+ which is termed as an advanced form of 4G version.  LTE(Long Term Evolution) refers to a 4G network and in certain countries, LTE+ is termed as LTE-A where A is for advanced. Basically, LTE+ is the advanced version of LTE with few changes which make LTE+ perform faster. LTE+ uses two bands to send data at the instant of time providing reduced congestion and better resultant speeds.  We are familiar with the fact that each new generation addition creates the older technology equipped phones incompatible. The result is the phone build with keeping 3G in mind, won\u2019t work with 4G network and can work if it has specific hardware in it. But with 4G, even your phone are 4G compatible there can be issues with compatibility.  India is offering 3 bands of 4G which includes 850 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 2300 MHz. The other band 700 MHz is kept safe for future use. In India, Jio has a license of 2300 MHz spectrum for PAN India purpose. As now 4G has some bands and maybe your phone doesn\u2019t support 2300 MHz band and it can make your phone incompatible with 4G. The new phones are upgraded with new techs but phones such as the Nexus 6 are not compatible with pre-Jio 4G networks in India. Have a look: Top 5 Video calling apps for distance calling VoLTE means Voice over LTE which renders unified format of voice traffic on LTE, and other systems as well. As Reliance Jio is the only network in India working over IP network, it has set VoLTE as standard which means all voice calls will be on the IP network like calling through the apps.  It also scales up the voice call experience as browsing and talking over the phone at the same time is possible now. With the 3G network, it is not possible to download and message through data services while talking on the phone and getting a call. This problem is sorted out with VoLTE addition. As per the telecom standard, VoLTE is the only source for delivering Voice services over LTE and VoLTE is meant to facilitate HD voice. This is the true sense of VoLTE and occupation of these services provide the True 4G experience.  This post has explained the meaning of 3G, 4G, LTE+, and VoLTE in detail and now it is sure when the talk will be about these tech topics, you won\u2019t be the one looking for the corner to hide in lack of knowledge about these trendy topics.

R. College, Nellore. Later, he acquired a bachelor's degree in law with specialisation in international law from Andhra University College of Law, Visakhapatnam.[10][11] He was a swayamsevak in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and joined ABVP during his college days. He was elected as the president of the students' union of colleges affiliated to the Andhra University. He came into the spotlight for his prominent role in the Jai Andhra Movement of 1972. While Kakani Venkata Ratnam led the movement from Vijayawada, Naidu took active part in the agitation in Nellore, until it was called off a year later.\n In 1974, he became the convener of the anti-corruption Jayaprakash Narayan Chhatra Sangharsh Samiti of Andhra Pradesh. He took to the streets in protest against the Emergency and was imprisoned. From 1977 to 1980, he was president of its youth wing.\n Both as a student leader and political figure, Naidu gained prominence as an orator, who championed the cause of the farmers and the development of backward areas. His oratory skills and political activism propelled his political career and he was elected as an MLA to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly twice from Udaygiri constituency in Nellore district in 1978 and 1983. He rose to become one of the most popular leaders of the BJP in Andhra Pradesh.[weasel\u00a0words][citation needed]\n After serving in various organisational posts of the BJP at the state and national level, he was elected as a member of the Rajya Sabha from Karnataka in 1998.[12] He was re-elected twice, in 2004 and 2010, from Karnataka.[13][14] He served as the party spokesperson from 1996 to 2000, bringing to the job his panache for quirky alliterations and similes. Unlike most politicians from southern India, Naidu made an effort to master Hindi, going on to address public rallies in northern India.[citation needed]\n After the NDA victory in the 1999 general elections, he became the Union Cabinet Minister for Rural Development in the government headed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.[15] He was known for aggressively pushing for reforms in rural development and for the many schemes introduced during this period such as the 'Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.'[16][17][18]\n Naidu succeeded Jana Krishnamurthi as the National President of the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2003.[19] On 28 January 2004, he was elected unopposed for a full three-year term.[20] After the defeat of the BJP-led NDA in the 2004 general elections, he resigned from his post on 18 October 2004 and was succeeded by L.

Not every\u00a0iPad\u00a0has an LED flash on the back, but many of\u00a0Apple's\u00a0tablets offer a nice selfie flash. The iPad has boasted relatively good quality cameras since 2011, and the camera app is quite similar to that of the iPhone, simply formatted for the larger screen. When a flash is available, users can set it to on, off, or auto with a tap of the flash icon, which looks like a lightning bolt symbol. In a perfect world, a user would only need a flash to achieve special effects, such as freezing fast-moving objects, flattening the shading of an object, or highlighting sparkly elements. Perhaps someday, an iPad camera will be able to photograph a moment exactly as it appears to the human eye. While iPad cameras are getting much closer to that ideal, more improvement is needed to\u00a0accurately capture the motion, light, and color of a scene. In the meantime, a flash adds the extra light that's necessary sometimes. Related: What iPhones & iPads Work With Animoji? Here's The Full List While only a few iPad models have dedicated LED flash\u00a0hardware, most tablets that\u00a0Apple\u00a0has made in the last few years can use the front-facing flash. Except for the first generation, every iPad Pro has a True Tone LED flash unit mounted beside the rear cameras. The iPad mini 6 is the only non-Pro model with this hardware. The True Tone flash technology\u00a0can match the\u00a0color temperature to that of the ambient lighting. Without this feature, it could be challenging to get a proper white balance, making part of the face have a yellow or blue cast. Many newer iPad models have a selfie flash. Of course, this is the common trick where the tablet increases display brightness to the maximum brightness and shows a white screen briefly to serve as a 'flash' while snapping the picture. Apple calls this \"Retina Flash,\"\u00a0and it's available on iPad\u00a0mini 5 and later, iPad 5 and later, iPad\u00a0Air 3 and later, as well as every iPad Pro except for the first-generation iPad Pro. The iPad's front-facing flash isn't as bright as the rear flash, but since the subject is usually the person holding the tablet, it's close enough to provide good light. Apple's \"Retina Flash\"\u00a0tints the color of the white that appears on-screen to match the ambient light, just like the True Tone flash of the rear LED. Naturally, the rear-facing LED flash is strong enough to brighten a group of people or larger objects, allowing the iPad Pro and iPad mini 6 to be useful for photography in more circumstances.

However, SSDs have a number of benefits over traditional storage methods like mechanical hard disk drives. SSDs are faster, use less energy, are more reliable (no moving parts) and have a more compact form factor. It\u2019s clear that SSD is usually the best option for modern computers. But there are still a lot of factors to consider when looking at different SSDs and capacity sizes. For example, consider a situation where you\u2019re presented with a choice between 256 GB vs 512 GB SSD storage options in a computer or laptop. In this article we\u2019ll try to help you decide which SSD size is best for you, so let\u2019s get started. Table of Contents Deciding between 256 GB and 512 GB SSD storage options should begin by considering what each drive capacity is best at. Where does a 256 GB SSD excel over a 512 GB SSD? Of course, the most obvious answer comes down to price. A few years ago, a computer with a 256 GB SSD drive was almost always significantly less expensive than a 512 GB SSD drive. This price difference between the two computer drive options still exist today but SSD drives are much cheaper nowadays. This means that a 256GB option will still cost less but not that much. But what about actual usage scenarios? Cost might be the most readily apparent point of divergence between the two SSD options. However, storage space and functionality should be your main focus when thinking about actual usage scenarios. There was a time when 256 GB was considered immense. But today it\u2019s extremely easy to fill up a 256 GB drive. Gaming in particular tends to use up a lot of space. For example, some of the more popular MMORPGs require over 85 GB just for the initial install. Updates might require even more space. And if you\u2019re using offline storage for streaming movies you can expect to easily use over 1 GB per film. Likewise, seasons of TV shows used with offline storage use up even more space. This essentially means that a 256 GB drive is best used for light use like office work, browsing, email communication etc. You probably don\u2019t want to go with this option if you do a lot of gaming, work with video editing, or even watch a lot of locally stored videos. It\u2019s also generally not the best option if you\u2019re hoping to future-proof your setup. Data requirements are constantly growing. And it\u2019s usually best to safeguard against this trend with larger drives on devices that we plan to be using for years to come.  A device with 512 GB SSD is generally the best option for most types of computer users. General users won\u2019t need to stress about computer specs limits or how they\u2019re using their device. They\u2019ll always have enough space to do whatever catches their attention. Gamers will have enough space to keep even large games locally installed. And they won\u2019t have to worry about size constraints when keeping multiple games installed at the same time. And people who work with media such as photos, uncompressed audio, or video will be able to take their art to the next level with no fear of a file not saving due to lack of space. The price difference between a 256 GB and 512 GB SSD scales fairly evenly. With some storage options, you\u2019ll see a dramatic price hike as storage size increases. This is especially true for SD and Micro SD cards. But as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay roughly 10-20 cents per gigabyte in most internal NVMe SSDs. Of course, a variety of different factors can push that price point up or down. For example, well-known brands typically charge a little more than the competition. For a 256 GB SSD you\u2019ll typically see drives priced between $30 and $40. And for a 512 GB SSD prices usually range between $50 and $70. If you look over the SSD options you might find a few terms coming up which put them into different categories. The interface connection type is one of the characteristics that define different SSD categories. Two popular SSD connection types are typically SATA or PCIe/NVMe. These connection types define also the data transfer speed of the drive with the rest of the computer. SATA SSDs were designed around older standards for hard drives. The primary advantage of SATA SSDs comes from compatibility with the SATA interfaces used in older hard drives. These older mechanical hard drives typically used a SATA interface to communicate with a computer\u2019s motherboard. SATA SSDs leveraged the same interface to provide users with a drop-in upgrade option. However, in a modern context, it\u2019s usually best to avoid SATA SSDs. Today, most computers ship with support for the new PCIe/NVMe SSD connection standard. NVMe uses a system\u2019s PCIe interface to communicate with the motherboard. This port was specially designed with higher bandwidth data in mind. The difference between bandwidth in SATA and PCIe is striking. PCIe can send roughly twice as much data as SATA in the same amount of time. All of this leads to an important point. You\u2019ll get far faster read/write speeds when using an NVMe SSD over PCIe than you would if using an SSD through SATA. Of course there\u2019s more than one way to acquire more storage space for your computer than replacing its main hard drive. Here are some options to get more storage for your computer. Most people will find that they can gain a surprising amount of space by just getting rid of the largest unused files on their computer. It\u2019s also important to make sure you\u2019re actually emptying your recycle bin after deleting files. It\u2019s not too unusual for people to delete files for months or even years before remembering that they haven\u2019t actually finalized the process by emptying their recycle bin. Cleaning up clutter on your computer will typically provide you with a wealth of free space. All of those downloaded files that you intend to clean up later inevitably build up over time. And this can turn into a considerable waste of hard drive space unless you\u2019re actively deleting them. Cloud storage is also a solid option to get more storage on your computer. Cloud storage leverages storage space on remote cloud servers. Many of the leading storage providers offer a generous amount of space for free accounts. And paid plans offer even more storage space. Of course, the big disadvantage with cloud storage is that remotely stored files will typically need to be downloaded before you can use them. It\u2019s also important to make sure you\u2019re storing files on remote cloud storage rather than syncing files to it. If you\u2019re syncing files to a cloud server then the files will exist on both the remote server and your computer\u2019s hard drive. This means that you wouldn\u2019t be freeing up any space by using cloud storage. You can also use a second SSD with your computer. This is typically done in one of two ways. The most efficient way to go about this process is by installing a second internal SSD. The second SSD should work just as fast and efficiently as the primary drive. Most operating systems will automatically detect the second drive and make it easily accessible within its file explorer. But there\u2019s more to SSDs than internal devices. You can also find a wide variety of SSDs designed for portability. These devices typically have a slim form factor and simply plug into one of your computer\u2019s USB ports. The big advantage of an external SSD is that you can use it almost anywhere and with a variety of different devices. For example, it\u2019d be easy to take movies, shows, or games from your home computer to a friend\u2019s place if they\u2019re on an external SSD. It\u2019s just a matter of unplugging it from your computer and then plugging it into another one. But these drives also have a disadvantage \u2013 speed. Even USB C is significantly slower than an internal PCIe interface. But even with that limitation, external SSDs are still an easy way to increase your available storage space. At this point, you\u2019ve seen various options for increasing storage space and also compared 256GB vs 512GB SSD sizes. But the best performance will always come from your primary internal drive. It\u2019s the default where you save data, install software, store works in progress, and generally look at before any of your other physical or cloud drives. And this circles back to the big question. Is a 256 GB SSD enough or should you go with a larger 512 GB option? It\u2019s true that different usage scenarios might allow people to get by with a smaller 256GB SSD. For example, if you\u2019re only using your computer for smaller-scale tasks like editing documents, regular office work, light gaming, browsing, social media etc then you will be fine with a 256 GB SSD. But keep in mind that this type of light use also means forgoing things like heavy gaming or working with multimedia. Even offline storage for TV/movies goes beyond the usual definition of light use. Some people will be fine with 256 GB SSDs. But most will find that they have one or more hobbies that require heavier resource use than they initially assumed. As such it\u2019s usually better to go with a 512 GB SSD compared to 256GB for future-proofing your computer usage.

It felt simple. I just placed a finger on it, waited a moment, and after my phone vibrated the tiniest amount to confirm everything\u2019s okay, I was let into my device. Now, though, after spending a week with the side-mounted fingerprint sensor on the Honor 20 Pro, I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s the simplest or most convenient place for a fingerprint sensor after all.  Back in the bulky bezel days, there was one obvious place for manufacturers to put their shiny new fingerprint sensors. Apple, Samsung, and pretty much everyone else plonked a big home button on the bezel at the bottom of their displays, and we got used to holding our phones so that either thumb was positioned to quickly get scanned. But as bezels got smaller, and home buttons started to disappear, everyone started to get more creative with their biometric security.  Many, including Samsung, Google, and LG, initially went for rear-mounted fingerprint sensors, and until now I\u2019ve been firmly in favor of this decision. I like their simplicity, I like the fact that you only have to register one finger on each hand to use them, and I like that I can feel where they are without having to look at my phone, unlike Apple\u2019s Face ID or in-display scanners that only cover a small portion of the screen. This sounds like a minor thing, but one of my main uses for Google Pay is tapping my way through the London Underground\u2019s ticket barriers to pay my fare, and in a crowded ticket hall I want to be able to keep my eyes on where I\u2019m going rather than making eye-contact with my phone\u2019s face-scanning biometric security, or looking for the specific part of the screen that\u2019s able to scan my thumbprint. For the most part, Honor has been happy to follow this trend, but with the Honor 20 Pro it took a slightly different approach and mounted its sensor on the side. It\u2019s not the only one, Samsung recently used a side-mounted sensor on the Galaxy S10E (and the ill-fated Galaxy Fold), and Sony has been using them for years on a range of its devices. But the Honor 20 Pro is the first of these phones that I\u2019ve had the chance to use extensively, and it completely changed my attitude. Initially, it took me a little while to warm to the sensor placement on the Honor 20 Pro. With a rear-mounted sensor you only really need to scan your two index fingers to cover every eventuality, but with a side-mounted sensor there are so many more possibilities. To start with, I set up both the index finger and middle finger on my left hand and the thumb on my right hand, but eventually I\u2019d added both thumbs, middle fingers, and index fingers when I realized you might use any of these fingers when unlocking a phone that laid flat on a desk. That\u2019s six fingerprints you have to register in total, and at the time it felt like a hassle. But unless you\u2019re changing your phone super regularly, I can\u2019t see this being a problem you\u2019ll have more than once a year. Once it\u2019s set up, combining the fingerprint sensor and power buttons makes so much sense. Unless you\u2019re picking up your phone to specifically check your notifications, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re going to want to unlock it, so there\u2019s little sense in wasting space having two buttons when one will suffice. Yes, this means that you\u2019ll hardly ever see your lock screen any more, but if you really need to look at it then you can nudge the power button with an unregistered part of your thumb to wake the phone without unlocking it. Alternatively, the Samsung Galaxy S10E also has a neat feature where you can double tap the screen to wake up the phone without unlocking it, although this feature isn\u2019t available on Honor\u2019s device.  It\u2019s also great when you have a phone on the desk in front of you. Rather than committing to picking up a handset, like I have to do whenever I want to unlock my Pixel 3, I can just give the Honor 20 Pro a little squeeze to have a quick scroll through Twitter or check my emails. It\u2019s another little thing, but it\u2019s something I found myself doing a lot. It\u2019s not just me that\u2019s discovered a soft spot for the side-mounted fingerprint sensor. When my colleague Natt reviewed the budget member of the Samsung Galaxy S10 lineup, the S10E, she also loved its placement. She said she found it sat naturally underneath her thumb while she was using the device, and was easy to instinctively feel out without having to look at the phone. Compared to previous Samsung Galaxy devices, it also had the added benefit of being nowhere near the phone\u2019s rear camera, unlike the S8 and S9 which placed them so close together on the rear of the phone that it became easy to confuse them when feeling with your finger.  Side-mounted sensors aren\u2019t without their drawbacks. They\u2019re not symmetrical for one thing, meaning that they don\u2019t cater equally to right-handed and left-handed people. That might not be a problem for some, but if you\u2019ve got smaller hands and you\u2019re using a larger device, reaching your fingers around the back of the device to a sensor on its side could be difficult. Side-mounted sensors are also under more space constraints than those on the backs of devices, so you have to be more specific about how you place your thumb or finger on it if you want it to scan correctly first time. Spending more time setting up your fingerprints correctly can help with this, but it\u2019s more effort than you\u2019d have to put into setting up a rear-mounted sensor.  Perhaps understandably, as the technology improves, the industry at large now seems to be shifting inexorably toward under-display fingerprint sensors. In just a few short years, they\u2019ve gone from being a niche feature on Chinese handsets to featuring heavily in two of the biggest flagships of the year, the Samsung Galaxy S10 and the OnePlus 7 Pro. Now, early prototypes from the likes of Xiaomi suggest that the next step will be to turn most or even all of the screen into one large sensor.  What I like most about the side-mounted fingerprint sensor is the way it blurs the line between functionality and security. You don\u2019t really think about scanning your finger on the Honor 20 Pro\u2019s sensor, it just happens automatically when you go to wake your device. I hope this is the future we eventually reach with in-display fingerprint sensors, where your device is seamlessly checking your fingerprints as you use your phone. When security becomes invisible, the inconvenience of using it almost completely disappears, people are willing to put up with more of it, and everyone becomes safer as a result.  We\u2019re not there yet. In-display fingerprint sensors still cover just a small part of the screen, and you still have to think just that little bit about using them in order to get them to work. But while we\u2019re still waiting for them to cover the entirety of a screen, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor feels like the perfect solution, and I hope more manufacturers follow Honor and Samsung\u2019s leads and start using them.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

It is designed for use when you want to combine a slow shutter speed with flash. Unlike the standard flash mode, rear curtain sync flash will fire the flash at the end of the exposure, rather than the start. In this article we'll take a in-detail look at rear curtain sync flash, looking at how the resulting image differs to standard flash, and why and when you might want to use this flash mode.  As I stated in the introduction to this article, the difference between rear curtain and standard (first or front curtain) flash is when the camera's flash fires during an exposure. First curtain flash, which is the normal flash mode, will fire the flash right at the start of the exposure. Second curtain flash will fire the flash right at the end of the exposure. You will only be able to see any difference between the two modes when using a relatively slow shutter speed. With fast shutter speeds, the time difference between the start and end of the exposure is so small that whether the flash is at the start or end of the exposure makes no difference. Some camera models will always use first curtain sync flash above a certain shutter speed, even if you have second curtain sync set as the flash mode. This technique of using a relatively long exposure (typically anything longer than 1/25s ) combined with flash is often called 'dragging the shutter'. The benefit of rear curtain flash comes when you are using a slow shutter speed and have your subject traveling across the frame in your image. Without flash this would just appear as a blur. But by adding flash at the end of the exposure, the flash 'freezes' the subject, with the trail of blur behind them. Easy Swing by Jonathan Vahsen on Flickr (licensed CC-BY-ND) Whereas with first curtain flash (the standard flash mode), the flash will fire and freeze the subject right at the start of the exposure. Then as they carry on moving during the exposure, they will create a blur trail in front of them. This can look quite unnatural and strange, as if the subject is moving backwards. Day 130 - Midweek Run by Phil and Pam Gradwell (to be) on Flickr (licensed CC-BY) If you are photographing a static subject, nothing in the scene is moving, and the camera is not moving either, then you won't see any difference between a photo shot with first curtain or rear curtain flash. The difference only comes when you are using a slow shutter speed and the image includes movement of some sort. If you're wondering why the flash modes are called first and second curtain or front and rear curtain, this is to do with the way the shutter works in most cameras. Before the exposure starts, the first 'curtain' is covering the image sensor. When you press the shutter button, this curtain is pulled down, revealing the image sensor and starting the exposure. Then at the end of the exposure the second curtain is pulled down over the image sensor, covering it again and ending the exposure. You can read more about the shutter in this article: Photography Basics \u2013 Shutter. As I said earlier, not all cameras support rear curtain flash sync. However, most DSLRs, Compact System Cameras, and advanced fixed lens cameras do have it available as an option. You will normally find it somewhere in the camera settings menu, often grouped with other flash related settings. Bear in mind that some cameras only display certain options depending on other options you have set, so if you can't find the setting easily, then it is probably worthwhile to check your camera manual. This should tell you exactly where in the menus the rear sync / 2nd curtain flash setting is and what other settings (if any) could make it unavailable. Unfortunately, even if a camera does support rear curtain flash, this mode is not always compatible with speedlight flashes. Some camera manufacturers purposefully limit this feature to only be available when the camera detects that a flash from the same manufacturer is attached. However, some third party flash manufacturers have managed to work round this, so the camera thinks that the flash is an official model, and will let you use special flash modes such as rear sync flash. But with many older external flashes, or more basic third party speedlights, you may find that your camera does not allow you to use rear curtain flash. In this case there are a couple of possible workarounds. The first is to use your camera's pop-up flash (if it has one, and if the pop-up supports rear-sync flash) to trigger your speedlight flash off-camera. For this you need an optical trigger for your external flash. Many speedlights come with an optical trigger built-in, or you can buy one separately that attaches to your speedlight's foot. Example of an optical slave trigger for use with speedlight flashes that do not have an optical trigger built-in Then, when your camera fires the pop-up flash at the end of the exposure, this in turn will trigger your external speedlight flash. There are a lot of 'ifs' with this procedure though. There has to be enough time between the camera firing its flash and the end of the exposure for the optical trigger to receive the flash from the pop-up, trigger the speedlight flash, and then the speedlight flash to fire. Given that the flash is meant to fire right at the end of the exposure, this is a very tight timing, and you could find that the speedlight flash fires after the exposure has already finished. You could also find that you end up with double 'frozen' parts in your image. The subject could be frozen first by the pop-up flash, then again a few milliseconds later by the speedlight flash. This will depend on how quickly your subject is moving and the amount of delay between the pop-up flash firing and the speedlight flash firing. The other option, again with using the speedlight flash off-camera, is to use a radio trigger that allows setting a delay for the flash. In this instance you would put a radio trigger in your camera's hotshoe, and another (receiver) attached to the speedlight flash. You then use the trigger to use delayed flash to make it so that the flash will fire near the end of the exposure. For example, for a 3s exposure you might set the trigger for a 2.9s delay. The main disadvantage of this is that if you change your shutter speed, you then also need to change the flash delay. You also want to make sure you get the delay as close to perfect as possible, otherwise you could end up with a little bit of blur after the flash fires. Finally, not many radio triggers offer a delay option, and models with a delay setting tend to cost quite a bit more than the most basic radio triggers. The Cactus V6 - example of a radio flash trigger with delay setting So, if you are considering buying a speedlight flash, then it is worthwhile checking whether it will be compatible with the rear curtain sync mode of your camera. For the freezing effect of rear sync flash to work well, your subject needs to be against a dark background. If there is too much ambient light in the scene, then the camera will record this light on the background, and your frozen subject will appear partially transparent. Circus Train Under the Christmas Tree by Don DeBold on Flickr (licensed CC-BY) Knowing that parts of the scene lit by continuous light will blur (if the subject or camera is moving) while parts lit mainly by flash will freeze can be used to creative effect. You can choose which parts of an image to blur during the exposure by using a continuous light aimed carefully where you want it. Note that you may have to use some kind of light modifier, (such as a grid, snoot, barn doors, or just pieces of card) to help direct where the light shines. A more general tip for using long exposures with flash (it could be rear or first curtain sync flash) is that you don't need to have a moving subject to get an interesting photo. If you have a mostly dark scene with some lights in it, you can move the camera during the exposure, which will blur the lights. But the flash will freeze your subject. You end up with an image of a sharp subject with light trails moving across the image. Goldies Jan.07.2011 by Sharif / Sean Sharifi on Flickr (licensed CC-BY-ND) The main use of rear sync flash is for capturing both a sharp image of a subject, but also capturing their movement. Panning is often a method used to achieve this same aim without flash. But what about if you combine panning with a moving subject and rear sync flash? If you're panning slightly slower than the subject is moving across the frame, then you'll end up with a blurred background, a short blur trail behind the subject, and a sharp subject. Rear Sync Bike by musume miyuki on Flickr (licensed CC-BY) Even if you panned at the same speed as the subject, you'd likely end up with a sharper subject than you would by just panning with no flash. The technique of combining panning and flash is particularly useful when the subject is not moving parallel to you, which is a situation where just panning without flash doesn't work so well. Finally, here's a video that not only explains the theory behind 2nd curtain flash, but also gives a nice example of its use for a creative image: Hopefully you'll agree that combining second curtain flash with a slow shutter speed can be used to capture some great photos that you couldn't get any other way. It can be a hassle if you want to get it working with an off-brand speedlight, but once you've used second curtain sync it's unlikely you'll find much reason for ever using the standard flash mode of first curtain sync again.

But baked in One UI is the ability to turn the rear camera flash into a notification LED. Any incoming alerts or calls will cause the camera LED to blink, so you won't miss a thing. This feature can be found in all Galaxy phones running Android 7 or later, but those using the Galaxy S10 or newer will get the most of it, as that was Samsung's first flagship without the notification LED. It's great if you leave your phone laying face-down to where you can't see the always-on display, but you can also use it with the device face-up and get a subtle glowing effect emanating from beneath your phone. Open Settings, then scroll down and choose \"Accessibility.\" Select \"Advanced Settings,\" then \"Flash Notifications\" on the next screen. Here, you'll find two options: \"Camera flash,\" and \"Screen flash.\" The option you are looking for is a camera flash. There are a few things to note when using this feature. First, the rear flash is very bright, unlike the traditional notification LED, so your eyes might be bothered if you leave the phone face-down at night. You should also note that all alerts will cause the LED to flash, but only incoming phone calls will cause the LED to flash repeatedly. Alerts from other apps will only flash twice, so be careful not to miss it.

Any ideas? ????"], "https://www.elprocus.com/ambient-light-sensor-working-and-applications/": [" The \u2018lux\u2019 is the standard international unit of the ambient light used for the illuminance. The typical performance of this sensor ranges from below 50 lux to over 10,000 lux. Here 50 lux can be generated inside dim light whereas over 10,000 lux at noontime. The lux is the SI unit for illuminance and that is equivalent to one lumen for each square meter. This is used in photometry for measuring the intensity which is perceived through the human eye when light hits through a surface. In the year 2004, there are the phones are many phones are designed with ambient light sensor and 30% of the phones are sold out. Whereas in the year 2016, 85% of the phones are inbuilt and sold out. An ambient light sensor is one kind of component which is utilized in mobile devices, smartphones, notebooks, LCD TVs, and automotive displays. Ambient light sensor working principle is, it is a photodetector, used for detecting the sum of ambient light nearby & appropriately reduces the mobile screen\u2019s light. So this avoids the screen brightness whenever the users are modified for vision within a dark room otherwise less brightness as the mobile is utilized outdoors during the daytime. By dimming the mobile screen one can prolong the lifetime of the battery. There are three types of ambient light sensors which are namely photodiodes, photonic ICs, & phototransistors which combine a photodetector & an amplifier in one device. The ambient light sensor is considered like harvesting energy source to control bathroom fixtures, remote weather sensors, heartbeat monitors & low power devices. The ambient light can be measured accurately using the harvesting system at the heart of energy. The design of a harvesting system illustrates an easy, commercial circuit which offers a voltage that is proportional to the strength of ambient light. The sensor used in the circuit is an LDR (light-dependent resistor), and the resistance of this will change with ambient light strength. When the sensor is in darkness, then the resistance will be decreased from millions of ohms in darkness as well as few hundreds of ohms in clear light. It is capable of detecting small or large fluctuations within light levels, it can differentiate among one light bulbs, straight sunlight, entire darkness, etc. Every application needs a suitable circuit as well as a physical arrangement for the correct lighting scenario. The sensor which is used in this circuit can be connected in a clear and waterproof field. The above ambient light sensor circuit gives an o/p voltage that reacts to both the light intensity & the input voltage with the LDR which is working as the gain resistor to the instrumentation amplifier (AD8226). The transfer function of the instrumentation amplifier is given below. VOUT = G (VIN+ \u2013 VIN-) + VREF In the above equation, \u2018G\u2019 is the gain of the circuit, and \u2018VIN+ as well as VIN-the positive & negative input voltages, and \u2018VREF\u2019 is the voltage at the reference pin. When the VIN- (negative input) and reference pin are connected to ground and VIN+ (input pin) is applied toward the positive input, then the gain will be G = VOUT/ VIN+ = 1 + 49.4 k\u03a9 /LDR  LDR = (49.4 k\u03a9) / (VOUT/ VIN+) \u2013 1 Whenever the LDR value is known, then the value can be decoded into the light level. Therefore, the task turns into one of observing op-amp\u2019s output with an input voltage. Here the positive voltage can be an AC voltage, or a DC voltage, or a balanced version of the power supply. So, the gain exactness can depend on the precision of two inside thin-film resistors which are trimmed. The above circuit is used to calculate ambient light by changing the photo resistor\u2019s resistance to a voltage and it can be calculated at a distant place. The instrumentation amplifier was selected due to its broad operating range of power supply which ranges from 2.7 V to 36 V, rail-to-rail o/p, functional completeness, and low quiescent current. This circuit handles with a gain resistor which ranges from a few ohms to infinity. Because these amplifiers turn into less-expensive and its improved act makes them perfect replacements intended for op-amps (operational amplifiers). The applications of the ambient light sensor include the following. The ambient light sensor is used to control the backlight of an LCD display based applications to control display brightness of mobile for reducing battery life. The applications of this sensor range from consumer electronics to automotive. This is the main benefit of mobile applications. These sensors are also used in all types of light sources like natural sunlight, incandescent lamps, and fluorescent. For instance, AMIS74980x ambient light sensor from AMI Semiconductor\u2019s is used within both automotive as well as consumer applications. The main feature of this sensor is, allowing the display controller to regulate the intensity in less dark current. Likewise, the ambient light sensor like ALS-SFH5711 from OSRAM hypes human eye characteristics intended for mobile & automotive applications. These devices are used to replicate the sensitivity arc of the person\u2019s eye, allowing mobile displays and the levels of its brightness to be attuned more accurately. These sensors are used in automotive applications like headlight control & cockpit dimming. The APDS-9004 ambient light sensor from Avago Technologies is used for backlighting control in DVD players, consumer LCD displays, mobile phones, notebook PCs, digital cameras, etc. The main feature of this sensor is an automatic alteration to save power & to increase the LCD screens life in handy display devices. Additionally, these sensors control the backlighting based on the program set by the maker. This sensor is also be used in indoor as well as outdoor lightings for turning on/off which include street lighting, electronic signals as well as signs. Thus, this is all about an overview of an ambient light sensor. From the above information, finally, we can conclude that this sensor decides how much light can be accessible within the region surrounding the phones. It automatically regulates the intensity of the mobile screen in order to preserve the life of mobile battery & to adjust the mobile screen to relieve eye tension. Here is a question for you, what are the benefits of a light ambient sensor?

Now that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is out, we expect the brand to introduce its first flagship with it in the form of Motorola X40. The phone cleared TENAA certification in China, and its global counterpart, Motorola Edge 40 Pro cleared FCC. The phone will likely be followed by a Motorola Edge 40. Although the spotlights are on the new flagships, the company is also preparing new mid-range and low-end phones, presumably for the G and E series. Today, a budget Motorola phone passed 3C and TENAA certifications. We are talking about the same low-end phone since it passed by 3C and TENAA with the same XT2335-3 designation. As usual, the 3C certification does not bring many details regarding this Motorola phone. However, TENAA is way more open to details. According to TENNA, the mysterious Motorola XT2335-3 packs a 6.5-inch IPS LCD screen with a modest HD+ resolution of 1,600 x 720 pixels.\u00a0 The phone also packs an unnamed Octa-Core CPU that has its main cores running at up to 2.2 GHz. We\u2019re not expecting a powerful chipset, hopefully, it will bring something with 5G connectivity. But it\u2019s hard to set things into stone right now. The curious part is about the RAM and Storage configurations.  The handset will have variants with 4 GB, 6 GB, 8 GB, and even 12 GB of RAM. Storage-wise, it has 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, and 512 GB of Internal Storage. That sounds like overkill. It\u2019s weird to imagine a budget phone with 12 GB of RAM and 512 GB of Internal Storage. Numbers are good, but they are not everything. 12 GB of RAM can be overkill if the processor turns out to be weak. The budget Motorola device will have a dual-camera setup. However, we have the main camera with 50 MP resolution and a decorative 2 MP for depth sensing. The device also gets an 8 MP selfie shooter. We don\u2019t think this phone will occupy the same stage as the Motorola X40. We expect a quieter release to happen in China in the coming weeks. The device cleared two important Chinese certification processes, so it\u2019s just a matter of time until it gets released. A technology enthusiast. Fascinated for technology.

Abdul Hamid was born on 1 January, 1944 in Kamalpur of Mithamoin Upazila under Kishoregonj district. His father\u2019s name is Late Hazi Md. Tayeb Uddin and mother\u2019s name is Late Tomiza Khatun. Early life and education\nMr. Md. Abdul Hamid passed his Matriculation from Nikli G.C. High School and both I.A and B.A from Gurudayal College of Kishoregonj. He obtained Bachelor of Law degree from Central Law College under Dhaka University. Afterwards, he started his profession as a Lawyer. Political career\nMr. Md. Abdul Hamid joined Chhatra League in 1959 and thereby his political career began. While studying in the college, he took leading part in anti-Ayub Movement in 1961. He was imprisoned by the then Pakistan Government in 1962 for his active participation in the student movement and opposing Hamoodur Rahman Education Commission Report. In 1962-63, he was elected General Secretary of Student Union in Gurudayal College of Kishoregonj and in 1965-66 the Vice-President of the same student union. Mr Hamid was the Founder President of Chhatra League of Kishoregonj Sub-division Unit in 1964 and also elected the Vice-President of Chhatra League of Mymensingh District Unit in 1966-67. He was again imprisoned in 1968 for leading student movement. Towards the end of 1969, he joined Awami League. In 1971, on being instructed by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, he started the movement in Kishoregonj amid tumultuous protest against Pakistani regime to create public opinion in favour of independence. In the wake of movement, he hoisted the flag of independent Bangladesh inscribed with the map in a huge student gathering at Rothkhala field in Kishoregonj on March17, 1971 in which thousands of students and people participated. On receiving the historic proclamation of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu for independence through a telegraphic message in the morning of 26 March in 1971, he instantly joined the Liberation War. With the cooperation of Bangalee Army officers in the early part of April 1971, Mr. Hamid procured approximately tk. 11 Crore and 78 lac from Kishoregonj, Bhairab and Bazitpur branches of National Bank of Pakistan and deposited the whole amount safely in the National Bank of Pakistan at its Brahmanbaria Branch considering that as a safe place of custody at that time for using it for the War of Liberation. Thereafter, he went to Agartola, India to take part directly in the War of Liberation. At that time, most of the Members of Parliament of greater Chittagong, Noakhali and Comilla had been staying there. Mr. Hamid discussed various strategies of Liberation War with them. Side by side, he exchanged views with the local public representatives and high government officials in Agartola. Later, towards the end of April, he again came back to Bangladesh to further organize people and went back to India. Taking several associates with him, he reached Balat via Tekarhat, Gumaghat, Panchara and Moilam of Meghalaya. He set a Youth Reception Camp in Balat for those who came from Bangladesh to participate in the Liberation War. He was the Chairman of that camp. The primary recruitment of the youth who came from Kishoregonj, Netrokona and Sunamgonj to join the war as freedom fighters, was mainly done in this camp. He was also one of the prominent members of Zonal Administrative Council constituted at Meghalaya to direct the Liberation War and for the better management of the refugees. He also acted as the sub-sector commander of Bangladesh Liberation Force (Mujib Bahini) for Kishoregonj and Sunamgonj Districts. He carried out those responsibilities for the entire period of Liberation War. After the victory of liberation war on 16 December, 1971 he organized meeting at various refugee camps in Meghalaya to motivate the Bangalees who took refuge there to return home. After the homecoming of the refugees, he returned to the country on 10 January 1972. Mr. Abdul Hamid became the Chairman of Kishoregonj District Relief & Rehabilitation Committee in Independent Bangladesh. In 1974, he was elected Vice-President of Kishoregonj District Awami League. During 1976-1978, Mr. Hamid was imprisoned by the then Military Government after the brutal killing of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He was the President of Kishoregonj District Awami League from 1978 to 2009 and was the President of Kishoregonj District Bar Association for 5 times during the period 1990-96. In the Pakistan National Assembly Election of 1970, Mr. Hamid was elected the junior most member from Mymensingh-18 Constituency. In 1972 he became the Member of Constituent Assembly (The Constituent Assembly was formed with the members of National Assembly and Provincial Assembly elected in the historic general election of 1970). As a pro-people and grass-root level popular leader of Bangladesh Awami League, he was elected Member of Parliament for several times. In the General Election of 1973, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2009 he was elected Member of Parliament from Kishoregonj-5 Constituency as a nominee of Bangladesh Awami League. Mr. Md Abdul Hamid was unanimously elected the Deputy Speaker in the Seventh Parliament on 13 July, 1996 and held the post till 10 July, 2001 .Later he became the Speaker of the Parliament on 12 July 2001 and remained so till 28 October 2001. In the Eighth Parliament he served as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition from 01 November, 2001 to 27 October 2006. Mr. Hamid was elected the Speaker in the Ninth Parliament and served office in this capacity during the period 2009-2013. He was also the Chairman of Working Committee, Standing Committee for Rules and Procedure, Standing Committee for Special Rights and Petition Committee of the Parliament. Social Work\nMr. Md Abdul Hamid is an ardent social worker and a patron of education and culture.

Now, there are several storage capacities, so you may be wondering how much to choose.  512 GB is enough for laptops or desktop PCs in most cases. It is a fairly high capacity that supports the installation of numerous applications and the storage of many files. In addition, it is an option with a good quality/price ratio.  Below, we will take a closer look at what 512GB of storage can be used for, and under what circumstances more capacity is preferable. Of course, we will also discuss the cases when not even 512 GB is necessary. Relevant for\u2026 Determining if 512 GB of SSD is a sufficient storage amount. See recommendations A few years ago, having a solid-state drive for storage was quite expensive. In fact, only high-end computers had this technology. Fortunately, they are becoming more popular every day, and the price of SSDs has dropped considerably. Most laptops nowadays come with SSDs, even with high capacities. Previously, only about 128 GB of SSD was allocated, so that the operating system was installed on this drive. For the rest of the files, you had an ordinary mechanical hard drive. Today this is not the case, given that most computers have completely replaced HDDs with SSDs, and for more than obvious reasons. SSDs are much faster, quieter, and even easier to install. The short answer is yes, as 512 GB is sufficient for storing pretty much anything you can imagine, as long as you\u2019re a low-end to a mid-range user. Most applications and computer programs do not exceed 100 GB. In the case of text files, documents, images, and even videos, they don\u2019t accumulate a large amount of storage. Overall, a 512GB SSD offers not only good capacity, but also great speed for watching videos, downloading files, playing video games, and using high-productivity applications. Anyway, right now we\u2019re going to look at various circumstances where we\u2019ll see just how useful that 512GB of SSD is. If you are a student, most of the files you use will be Word, PDF, or Excel. Of course, you may also use programming, design, or architecture software, but you can see for yourself that these types of programs do not consume much storage space. If you are only going to use the computer for educational purposes, you don\u2019t even need the 512 GB, as up to 256 GB is enough, especially if you use cloud storage services for personal photos and videos. If you\u2019re out of college and into your profession, you need a really good laptop. This applies especially to engineering in virtually all fields, be it computer science, mechanical, civil, or industrial engineering. However, Most of the programs used for engineering do not take up more than 30 GB. In this case, instead of looking for a large storage capacity, it is preferable that you dedicate that part of the budget to increase the RAM or to acquire a better processor, which will be more useful to run heavy applications. Another frequently asked question is whether this storage capacity is ideal for Apple devices. Again, this depends entirely on your needs and the type of files or applications you need to store on your computer.  Still, most users just use a Macbook to surf on the internet, use social media, and perform basic productivity tasks. Therefore, even 256 GB is more than enough for these types of users. Gamers are probably the ones wondering the most if 512 GB of internal storage is the most appropriate. Again, the answer is yes because most games are not heavy enough to accumulate 512 GB unless you install many games at the same time.  To date, the heaviest games are Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, requiring 175 GB of storage capacity, and Red Dead Redemption 2, with about 150 GB. Even installing the two games simultaneously, plus the operating system and some basic programs, 512 GB is still enough. For most users, buying more than 512GB is almost never recommended, much less with the advent of so many online storage services out there. Still, there are certain times when it\u2019s worth buying a 1TB SSD, or even more. For example, if you are fully engaged in editing photos, videos and other heavy resources, which will be used in large projects, storage is vital, as is the speed of that storage. In the same way, if you are a hardcore gamer who installs many games at the same time, especially games from the latest generation, 512 GB can also fall short. Even though in circumstances like these it is possible to resort to cloud storage, doing so with such large files is not very convenient. If you have the budget to buy a laptop with 512 GB, it\u2019s definitely worth it. This is a storage capacity that is enough for most users, and even gives you plenty of space to store large files, install video games or use heavy programs. Still, if you don\u2019t have a lot of money for a laptop with this storage capacity, it\u2019s a good idea to cut back on the storage capacity a bit, where 256GB is enough for entry-level users. You should pay more attention to RAM, processor, battery, and even graphics card than internal storage itself. \u00a9 2022 Computer noobs Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Blog About us Contact"], "https://www.stu.ca/economics/dev-gupta/": [" gupta@stu.ca \u00a0 Dr. Dev Gupta received his BA (Hons) from Gujarat University, MA from Delhi School of Economics, and MA and PhD from McMaster University.

From 2001 until 2014, Modi served as Gujarat\u2019s chief minister. He is a Varanasi-born parliamentarian. He belongs to the\u00a0 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He is the second prime minister who does not adhere to the Indian National Congress to win two successive victories in the Lok Sabha or house of representatives of India\u2019s government. He was also the first prime minister born after the Attainment of independence in 1947. He has served as prime minister for the most significant duration of any party other than Congress. \u00a0On May 26, 2014, Narendra Modi took the oath of office as PM of India following the resounding victory of the National Democratic Alliance, led by the BJP, in the 2014 parliamentary elections. After the National Democratic Alliance, led by the BJP, won the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Modi began his term of office. Modi is India\u2019s fourth-longest-serving prime minister and the lengthiest non-Congress leader on December 6, 2020. In Vadnagar, Mehsana region, Bombay State, on September 17, 1950, a Gujarati Hindu household of shopkeepers gave birth to Narendra Damodardas Modi. He was the third of Damodardas Mulchand Modi and Hiraben Modi\u2019s six kids, born between 1920 and 1989. The Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) group, which the Indian government classifies as an OBC, was where Modi\u2019s ancestors originated. Modi received his M.A. in political theory at Gujarat University in Ahmedabad after growing up in a tiny hamlet in rural Gujarat. Earlier in the 1970s, he entered the pro-Hindu RSS and organized a local chapter of the ABVP, the RSS\u2019s student wing. Modi rapidly ascended the RSS ladder, and his affiliation with the group greatly aided his eventual political career. Modi entered the BJP in 1987, and one year later, the Gujarat unit of the party appointed him secretary general. He had a significant role in significantly increasing the group\u2019s influence in the region during the ensuing years. Modi assisted the BJP in winning the 1995 state legislature elections, which in March enabled the party to become the first-ever BJP-controlled administration in India. Modi was one of the BJP MPs who participated in a partnership government in the state in 1990. Unfortunately, the BJP\u2019s hold on the state administration was only in place until September 1996. Keshubhai Patel\u2019s condition was deteriorating in 2001, and the BJP suffered a couple losses in by-elections for state legislature seats. Patel\u2019s reputation had been tarnished by claims of misuse of authority, bribery, and bad management, as well as by how his government handled the 2001 Bhuj disaster. Modi, who had voiced concerns about Patel\u2019s office, was selected as the potential applicant for the chief minister when the BJP\u2019s top leadership was looking for someone. Modi turned down Patel\u2019s offer to serve as his deputy chief minister, assuring L. K. Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was \u201ceither to be entirely accountable for Gujarat or not at all,\u201d despite Advani\u2019s concerns about Modi\u2019s lack of government expertise and his desire to avoid alienating Patel. He succeeded Patel as Gujarat\u2019s CM on October 3, 2001. He was charged with preparing the BJP for the elections in December 2002. After taking the oath of office as Gujarat\u2019s chief minister on October 7, 2001, Modi was elected to the legislative council on February 24, 2002, beating Ashwin Mehta of the INC by 14,728 ballots. \u201cGood governance with good intentions is the hallmark of our government. Implementation with integrity is our core passion.\u201d Modi was designated the BJP\u2019s nationwide group\u2019s secretary in 1995, and after three years, he was made the association\u2019s overall secretary. He kept that position for an additional three years. Still, in October 2001, he succeeded Keshubhai Patel, a senior BJP member who had been blamed for the provincial government\u2019s inadequate reaction to the Seismic devastating events in Gujarat previously that year, which claimed more than 20,000 lives. In a by-election held in February 2002, Modi ran in his first campaign and gained a seat in the Gujarat legislative council. But Modi\u2019s continued political triumph in Gujarat elevated him to a position of authority within the BJP leadership. It paved the way for his re-entry into the ruling elite. Under his direction, the BJP won a significant victory in the parliamentary assembly elections of December 2002, taking 127 of the 182 house seats. The BJP won the state parliamentary elections for Gujarat again in 2007, taking 117 seats, and in 2012, with 115 seats. The organization ran on a platform of expansion and progress for the state. Modi prevailed in his elections and was re-elected as chief minister. Modi and the BJP won the election after a spirited contest in which he presented himself as a realistic contender who could revive India\u2019s struggling economy. The BJP also won a resounding, overwhelming number of seats in the lower house. On May 26, 2014, Modi was sworn in as the nation\u2019s leader. Soon after assuming power, his administration launched several changes, notably initiatives to upgrade India\u2019s transit system and loosen restrictions on foreign direct investments. Early in his reign, Modi achieved two vital political goals. The first Chinese leader toured India in eight years, Chinese President Xi Jinping, paid him a visit in the middle of September. Modi supervised the execution of financial development and the propagation of Hindu culture while serving as prime minister. The administration tried to outlaw the selling of cows for slaughter, among other actions that would be primarily favored by Hindus. The market policies were extensive, bringing both transitory interruptions and fundamental changes across the country. The currency devaluation and substitution of 500- and 1,000-rupee bills with just a few hours\u2019 notice was one of the most extensive. It was intended to prevent \u201cblack money\u201d\u2014the currency used for illegal activities\u2014by rendering it challenging to trade significant amounts of cash. The Goods and Services Tax (GST), which replaced a convoluted regional taxation system and resolved the spiraling tax issue, was introduced by the government the following year, centralizing the consumer tax structure. Modi\u2019s administration abolished the special status of the Kashmir Valley during his reelection, depriving it of independence in October 2019 and placing it beneath the direct supervision of the federal government. Due to the government\u2019s substantial restrictions on travel and communication inside the territory and the uncertain legitimacy of denying Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s population the right to self-determination, the decision drew harsh condemnation and court cases. Modi is a Virgo and was born in The Year of the Tiger. He was born in September, and that makes his Zodiac sign Virgo. Modi was one of the few Indian leaders to achieve so, appearing on the front of Time Magazine\u2019s Asian issue in March 2012 and June 2014. He received the CNN-News18 Indian of the Year award. Narendra was depicted on the front of Time magazine in June 2015. He was included among the 100 Greatest influential individuals around the world by Time magazine in 2014, 2015, 2017, 2020, and 2021. On September 24, 2019, he received the Global Goalkeeper Award. All the cars that Modi rides are owned by the Government of India. He personally does not own any vehicles. According to Ghanchi\u2019s custom, Modi\u2019s parents set up his marriage when he was a little boy. At 13, he became betrothed to Jashodaben Modi, whom he later married. When Modi started his two years of travel which included stops at Hindu ashrams, they hardly ever saw one another and eventually drifted apart. He allegedly concealed that they never wed since doing so would have prevented him from joining the fundamentalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as a \u201cpracharak.\u201d For most of his life, Modi kept his wedding a secret. He initially mentioned his wife when he submitted his candidacy for the 2014 national elections. Modi and his mother, Hiraben, who is 100 years old, remain close. Yes, he can speak English fluently. He is married to Jashodaben, but they are estranged. No, he doesn't have a Ph.D. His net worth is $400 thousand. He is 71 years old today. He was born on September 17, 1950. \u00a0No, he does not have any biological children. He is 170 cm tall. His mother is Hiraben. His salary is $42,000 per year. \n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n  \n\n \u00a9 2022 DMICDC.com. All Rights Reserved.

But is that enough storage for you? 512GB is the standard size for a hard drive in most laptops these days. But if you take a look at some of the latest laptops from major brands, you\u2019ll see that they come with a 512 G SSD drive. So what does this mean for you? It means that if you have a lot of photos, videos, music, and other files, a 512 GB drive will be able to hold them all. And if you don\u2019t use all of the space on your 512  drive, you can always add an additional disk (of any size) to increase your storage capacity. So whether you\u2019re looking to up your laptop storage capacity or just want to make sure you have enough room for all of your files, a 512 G drive is the way to go. If you\u2019re looking to upgrade your laptop\u2019s storage, there are a few things to keep in mind. SSDs (solid-state drives) are significantly faster and more reliable than traditional hard drives, but they also come with a few drawbacks. Pros of an SSD: -Faster boot times and loading times. It-More reliable than a traditional drive. -More space for your files. -Consistent performance \u2013 doesn\u2019t suffer from wear and tear like a traditional drive does over time. Cons of an SSD: It-More expensive than a traditional drive. -Requires special software to be installed in order to work with the drive \u2013 not all laptops have this software installed by default. -May not be compatible with all laptop brands. If you\u2019re in the market for a new laptop, you may be wondering whether or not an SSD is worth the investment. Here\u2019s what you need to know about SSDs and how they differ from traditional hard drives. SSDs are faster and more responsive than hard drives, which makes them great for storing your data. They also retain data longer, so you can save files that you access frequently without having to wait for them to reload onto the hard drive. If you\u2019re planning on using your laptop for work, an SSD is a must-have. Not only will it speed up your computer, but it will also improve its overall reliability. If you\u2019re buying a laptop for personal use, however, you don\u2019t have to worry too much about the type of storage it has. There are a few main differences between HDD and SSD. First of all, an HDD is a magnetic disk storage device, while an SSD is a solid-state storage device. This means that an HDD contains bits of metal that can store data, while an SSD doesn\u2019t. HDD also takes up more space than an SSD. An SSD can hold several times as much data as an HDD, which makes them perfect for laptops. Furthermore, an SSD doesn\u2019t suffer from the same amount of lag as an HDD does. This means that it can boot up and load your programs faster than an HDD can. Overall, the main difference between HDD and SSD is their performance. An SSD is more efficient and will save you space on your laptop, while an HDD will still work fine for basic uses. An SSD (solid state drive) is a type of storage that has grown in popularity in recent years. Unlike a hard disk drive, an SSD does not have a spinning disk inside it. Instead, an SSD is made up of tiny cells that are interconnected. This makes it faster and more efficient than a traditional hard disk drive. One major advantage of using an SSD for your laptop is that it can save you a lot of time. Because an SSD can access data much faster than a traditional hard disk drive, you can start working on a project much faster.  You won\u2019t have to wait for the computer to spin down the hard disk to read your file, and you won\u2019t have to wait for the file to be written to the hard disk before you can access it. Another advantage of using an SSD is that it is more durable than a traditional hard disk drive. A hard disk drive can get damaged over time, which can cause problems with your computer. If you experience problems with your computer, you might need to replace the entire hard disk drive. An SSD, on the other hand, will usually only suffer from minor damage. So if something does happen to your SSD, you can usually just If you are only using the laptop for basic tasks such as browsing the internet, doing some light editing, or playing basic games, Then 512 GB SSD is enough. However, if you plan on using the laptop for more complex tasks such as photo editing or working on large documents, a GB SSD is not enough. A Hybrid or NVMe SSD would be better for this type of use.

Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament from Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest serving prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.  Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has reminisced about helping out after school at his father's tea stall at the Vadnagar railway station. At age 18, Modi was married to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He first publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi has asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of emergency was declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary. Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots in which 1044 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim, or otherwise criticised for its management of the crisis. A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally. While his policies as chief minister\u2014credited with encouraging economic growth\u2014have received praise, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state. Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the lower house of Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social welfare programmes. Modi centralised power by abolishing the Planning Commission and replacing it with the NITI Aayog. He began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and a transformation of the taxation regime, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. He oversaw the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Prime Minister, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings. Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding. Following his party's victory in the 2019 general election, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act and three controversial farm laws, which prompted widespread protests and sit-ins across the country, resulting in a formal repeal of the latter. Described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.

One of the most important things to consider when using this technique is how your shutter is syncing to your strobe.\u00a0 There are two curtains in most cameras, a front and rear curtain. When you have Front Curtain Sync on, the flash will fire when the first curtain opens at the beginning of the exposure. For Rear Curtain Sync, the flash will not fire until the second curtain closes at the end of the exposure. When shooting normally, you will not notice any difference whether you are using Rear or Front Curtain Sync. Where you will really notice a difference is when you drag your shutter and shoot at slower shutter speeds when working with both flash and constant light or ambient light. There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods.\u00a0 Benefit: cleaner subject, light trails free from the face. Trails look more intuitive and natural.\u00a0 Disadvantage: harder to frame and time action, since the subject has to move into the frame, and you cannot use your viewfinder since it is blacked out while the mirrors are flipped up. You might want to consider shooting wider in case the subject misses their mark, and crop in post.\u00a0\u00a0 Benefit: easier to frame and time action, since there is no delay when you release the shutter. You can do this with any camera/flash since it is the default sync setting. Disadvantage: light trails can block or distort subject, making the motion look less natural.\u00a0\u00a0 Now with more modern strobes (like the FJ400 used here) there is another option. We can pick exactly when in the exposure we want the flash to fire by setting a delay on the strobe. This allows you to decide exactly how much light you want in front of or behind the subject. With the FJ400, you can adjust in intervals up to 1/100 of a second. In the example photo, we decided to have the strobe fire right in the middle of the one-second exposure at .50 of a second.\u00a0 Shoot in a dark room. You need to make sure you are controlling your ambient light, so you\u2019ll want to turn off any lights that you do not want to show up when you drag your shutter (this includes the modeling light on your strobe). If you leave it on, your subject will look blurry and not frozen by the flash. Decide the direction that the subject moves. The direction the subject moves can make a huge difference in how your image will turn out. In the example above, we had the subject move camera-left, away from the constant light (a Flex RGBW). Something as simple as telling your subject to move a different direction can change how the light interacts with your subject, and if the light appears in front or behind the subject. Move the camera. Don\u2019t forget other ways to introduce movement into your image. You can have your model move around, but you can also have your model still and you can move the camera in different ways. Zooming in and/or out, panning, and rotating are just some examples. Each movement adds a completely different look and feel to the image. Every image will come out completely differently, so don\u2019t forget to have fun and be creative.

Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala. Photo: PTI New Delhi: The man who holds the strings of Karnataka currently is Vajubhai Vala. Ever since the Congress-Janata Dal(Secular) post-poll coalition has staked claim to form government in the state, people have been keenly watching the moves of Vala, an old Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker and multiple-term minister in the Gujarat state cabinet before he was appointed by the Narendra Modi government to take charge as the governor of south India\u2019s largest state. Now, in the latest,\u00a0despite the Congress-JD(S) combine submitting a list of 117 MLAs to back H.D. Kumaraswamy\u2019s claim to form the government in the state, Vala late Wednesday night invited\u00a0BJP leader B.S. Yeddyurappa\u00a0to form the government. Yeddyurappa now has 10 days to prove his majority on the floor of the assembly. Vala, 80, started his political career from Rajkot, the business hub of Saurashtra, in the early 1970s when he, as a 26-year-old, joined the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the earlier avatar of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Although he participated in the Jayaprakash Narayan-led anti-corruption movement for a while, he never played a prominent role.  It was in the late 1970s when he truly became active in politics and rose to prominence in Rajkot. A journalist in Rajkot recalled that Vala was elected as a corporator in 1975 but he was noticed by the state BJP leadership only when he successfully broke the Congress\u2019 stronghold in cooperative banks and societies in the city.  His ability to connect with people through his oratory skills, which often were laced with interesting anecdotes and his trademark Kathiawadi wit, and self-effacing demeanor soon propelled him to a position of influence. He already had the backing of the RSS, of which he was associated from his days in school, and his sizeable community, the OBC Karadiya Rajputs.  Eventually, he became the mayor of Rajkot in 1983 and that set him off for greener pastures. In 1985, he went on to win the assembly election from Rajkot West, a seat he retained for seven consecutive terms.  His accessibility to common people is what made him a state-wide BJP leader. As a result, the his party adequately rewarded him with important portfolios in BJP governments. He served as finance and revenue minister in Gujarat from 1998 to 2012, following which he was nominated as the speaker of the assembly. What is noteworthy is that he was perceived as a staunch supporter of Keshubhai Patel, who was the BJP chief minister from 1998 to 2001. However, when Narendra Modi was parachuted from New Delhi to take over as the chief minister after a rebellion in the BJP\u2019s ranks, he vacated his Rajkot seat for him to contest. This brought him into the good books of Modi, under whose chief ministerial tenure Vala served as the finance minister for nine years. Although many who were considered Keshubhai\u2019s supporters were shunted out during Modi\u2019s leadership, Vala remained one of his close aides for the entire 13 years he served as the chief minister. Soon after Modi came to power at the Centre, Vala was rewarded with the governorship of Karnataka.\u00a0Credit: YouTube A senior journalist in the state said, \u201cHe is a pragmatic, soft-spoken leader. He could ease a tense situation in the legislative assembly with his humour. He also has the record of the record of presenting 18 budgets in Gujarat assembly. As a speaker, too, he used his humour to control a chaotic house.\u201d In his long political career, Vala has occupied important positions even within the party. He served as the president of BJP\u2019s state unit of Gujarat. After his stint as a minister ended in 2012, he became the speaker of the assembly until 2014. Most who know Vala said that he has been one of the best speakers the state has had after Kundanlal Dholakia and Ashok Bhatt.  However, as his businesses grew alongside his political standing, he started to face the charge that he was using his position to garner personal profits illegally. \u201cIt is widely considered that he has big interests in the real estate sector in Rajkot and Ahmedabad regions. It has also been alleged that in every prime property that was built in the last decade, Vala had a share in it although not directly. Around 10 years ago, his apparent involvement was discussed in a share market scandal in Ahmedabad. However, I must add that none of these charges has been established,\u201d said the senior journalist. \u00a0 However, his indispensability in the party remained undisputed as the BJP leaders saw him as a \u201ccrisis manager\u201d of the party. \u201cBoth BJP workers and leaders would often approach him in times of trouble. He would help them in personal crises. As he kept growing in seniority, he became the go-to person for the national leadership to solve party conflicts,\u201d a farmer leader associated with RSS said, adding that he knew how to keep even his opposers happy.  Interestingly, Gujarat\u2019s current chief minister, Vijay Rupani, too started out as a corporator and then became mayor of Rajkot. He has occupied the Rajkot West seat after Vala retired from active politics. Despite a great degree of anti-incumbency working against him and having faced a stiff competition from his Congress\u2019 opponent Indranil Rajyaguru, Rupani could still hold on to the seat. Much of the credit goes to Vala who converted Rajkot West into one of the safest seat for the BJP over his long political career. Soon after Modi came to power at the Centre, Vala was rewarded with the governorship of Karnataka. There is a running joke in Gujarat that Vala, a crowd-puller, is having a hard time in Karnataka without an opportunity to use his Kathiawadi wit and humour in the Kannada-speaking state.  Perhaps, it is this discomfort that landed Vala in a controversy in 2016. He humorously urged college-going girls to give up \u201cfancy clothes and lipstick\u201d as an education institute, he thought, was not a platform for a \u201cbeauty contest\u201d.  \u201cBoth girls and boys are intelligent\u2026To achieve something in life you need to sacrifice something. Boys have to give up their specific addictions. Girls need to give up their fashion. You (girls) come to college for studies and not \u00a0to participate in any beauty competition. You (girls) don\u2019t need to get your eyebrows done, apply lipstick or trim your hair\u2026\u201d he said in 2016 while delivering the valedictory address of the 103rd Indian Science Congress in Mysuru. His comments were widely panned by women\u2019s rights groups. Today, however, he is definitely faced with a complicated situation of a different scale. His office and loyalty to the Sangh parivar are in conflict. BJP\u2019s national general secretary, Ram Madhav, recollected in a Facebook post that when Vala was the BJP state chief in 1996, it was H.D. Deve Gowda, who as the then prime minister, had dissolved a BJP government. Did he mean that it was Vala\u2019s turn to get back at Deve Gowda\u2019s son H.D Kumaraswami, who has staked claim for the chief minister\u2019s position in Karnataka? He doesn\u2019t make that clear.  With him inviting Yeddyurappa to form the government, he has made his choice clear between constitutional responsibility and party loyalty."], "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Narendra-Modi": [" Our editors will review what you\u2019ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Our editors will review what you\u2019ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Narendra Modi, in full Narendra Damodardas Modi,  (born September 17, 1950, Vadnagar, India), Indian politician and government official who rose to become a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In 2014 he led his party to victory in elections to the Lok Sabha (lower chamber of the Indian parliament), after which he was sworn in as prime minister of India. Prior to that he had served (2001\u201314) as chief minister (head of government) of Gujarat state in western India. Modi was raised in a small town in northern Gujarat, and he completed an M.A. degree in political science from Gujarat University in Ahmadabad. He joined the pro-Hindu Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) organization in the early 1970s and set up a unit of the RSS\u2019s students\u2019 wing, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, in his area. Modi rose steadily in the RSS hierarchy, and his association with the organization significantly benefited his subsequent political career. Modi joined the BJP in 1987, and a year later he was made the general secretary of the Gujarat branch of the party. He was instrumental in greatly strengthening the party\u2019s presence in the state in succeeding years. In 1990 Modi was one of the BJP members who participated in a coalition government in the state, and he helped the BJP achieve success in the 1995 state legislative assembly elections that in March allowed the party to form the first-ever BJP-controlled government in India. The BJP\u2019s control of the state government was relatively short-lived, however, ending in September 1996. In 1995 Modi was made the secretary of the BJP\u2019s national organization in New Delhi, and three years later he was appointed its general secretary. He remained in that office for another three years, but in October 2001 he replaced the incumbent Gujarat chief minister, fellow BJP member Keshubhai Patel, after Patel had been held responsible for the state government\u2019s poor response in the aftermath of the massive Bhuj earthquake in Gujarat earlier that year that killed more than 20,000 people. Modi entered his first-ever electoral contest in a February 2002 by-election that won him a seat in the Gujarat state assembly. Modi\u2019s political career thereafter remained a mixture of deep controversy and self-promoted achievements. His role as chief minister during communal riots that engulfed Gujarat in 2002 was particularly questioned. He was accused of condoning the violence or, at least, of doing little to stop the killing of more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, that ensued after dozens of Hindu passengers died when their train was set on fire in the city of Godhra. In 2005 the United States declined to issue him a diplomatic visa on the grounds that he was responsible for the 2002 riots, and the United Kingdom also criticized his role in 2002. Although in the succeeding years Modi himself escaped any indictment or censure\u2014either by the judiciary or by investigative agencies\u2014some of his close associates were found guilty of complicity in the 2002 events and received lengthy jail sentences. Modi\u2019s administration was also accused of involvement in extrajudicial killings (variously termed \u201cencounters\u201d or \u201cfake encounters\u201d) by police or other authorities. One such case, in 2004, involved the deaths of a woman and three men whom officials said were members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (a Pakistan-based terrorist organization that was involved in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks) and were alleged to have been plotting to assassinate Modi. Modi\u2019s repeated political success in Gujarat, however, made him an indispensable leader within the BJP hierarchy and led to his reintegration into the political mainstream. Under his leadership, the BJP secured a significant victory in the December 2002 legislative assembly elections, winning 127 of the 182 seats in the chamber (including a seat for Modi). Projecting a manifesto for growth and development in Gujarat, the BJP was again victorious in the 2007 state assembly elections, with a seat total of 117, and the party prevailed again in the 2012 polls, garnering 115 seats. Both times Modi won his contests and returned as chief minister. During his time as head of the Gujarat government, Modi established a formidable reputation as an able administrator, and he was given credit for the rapid growth of the state\u2019s economy. In addition, his and the party\u2019s electoral performances helped advance Modi\u2019s position as not only the most-influential leader within the party but also a potential candidate for prime minister of India. In June 2013 Modi was chosen the leader of the BJP\u2019s campaign for the 2014 elections to the Lok Sabha."], "https://www.britannica.com/place/Bangalore-India": [" Our editors will review what you\u2019ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Our editors will review what you\u2019ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.  Bengaluru, also spelled Bengalooru, formerly Bangalore,  city, capital (since 1830) of Karnataka state, southern India. Bengaluru is one of India\u2019s largest cities. It lies 3,113 feet (949 metres) above sea level, atop an east-west ridge in the Karnataka Plateau in the southeastern part of the state, at a cultural meeting point of the Kannada-, Telugu-, and Tamil-speaking peoples. Pop. (2001) city, 4,301,326; urban agglom., 5,701,446; (2011) city, 8,443,675; urban agglom., 8,520,435. The city\u2019s nucleus was a settlement around a mud fort, built in 1537 by a local chief, Kempe Gowda. The fort was reconstructed of stone in 1761. Bangalore was the headquarters of the British administration from 1831 to 1881, when the raja was restored. However, Britain retained an administrative and military presence in the city until Indian independence in 1947. Bangalore subsequently became the capital of the new state of Mysore and remained the capital during the reorganization of states in 1956; Mysore was renamed Karnataka in 1973. Large-scale immigration to Bangalore began in the 1950s as the state invested heavily in the public sector and in education. Employment opportunities were created for tens of thousands of people in southern India, and Bangalore grew to become one of the largest cities in the country. For several decades the city\u2019s economic growth was based largely on manufacturing industries. In the early 1990s, however, a combination of new national economic liberalization policies and the emergence of a strong education system in the city encouraged the development of an information and communications technology (ICT) sector in Bangalore and paved the way for its rapid development into both a national and a global ICT centre. In 2006 the city officially changed its name to Bengaluru, although the old name was still widely used. The following year the Greater Bengaluru Municipal Corporation (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) was created, which superseded the city\u2019s previous municipal government. At that time dozens of communities surrounding Bengaluru were absorbed into the new entity, greatly increasing the city\u2019s size and making its population almost identical to that of its urban agglomeration. Bengaluru consists of the closely built old town, together with a number of modern outlying areas (former suburbs) laid out in a gridiron pattern to the north and south, with many parks and wide streets. A large military area is situated just southeast of central Bengaluru. Outlying areas incorporated into the city in 2007 include large green spaces as well as farmland and are sites of population and ICT-related growth. Bengaluru has pleasant summers and mild winters. Summer temperatures average in the low to mid-90s F (about 34 \u00b0C), and winter temperatures rarely drop below 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C). The city receives about 36 inches (914 mm) of annual rainfall, which has been inadequate as a water supply for its increasing population and industry. Most of the city\u2019s water comes from the Kaveri (Cauvery) River, about 45 miles (70 km) to the south. The municipal government has undertaken projects to develop more reservoir lakes in the city and to reuse water. Prominent buildings include the legislative building Vidhana Soudha (1956) and the High Court building Attara Kacheri (1867), which are situated across from one another. Also of note are the maharaja of Mysore\u2019s palace, the Mysore Government Museum (1866), and Tippu Sultan\u2019s fort and palace. Notable local scenic spots are the Lalbagh (Lal Bagh) Botanical Garden (laid out in the 18th century), Cubbon Park (a garden with a lake, an aquarium, and a library), Hesaraghatta Lake, and Chamaraja Lake Reservoir. Nandi Hills (Nandigunda), a hill-station summer resort 38 miles (61 km) north, is the site of two temples dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. Aircraft, railway-coach, and machine-tool installations in the city are run by the federal government, and the state owns plants manufacturing electrical and telephone equipment, porcelain, and soap. Privately owned entities produce pharmaceuticals, textiles (silk), radio parts, glassware, leather and footwear, agricultural implements, paper, and watches. Sandalwood products and agarbattis (incense sticks) are also manufactured in Bengaluru. From the late 20th century the city became a centre of high-technology industry (notably ICT), and a number of large multinational technology corporations opened offices there. In addition, major domestic firms such as Infosys and Wipro established headquarters in the city. In 1998 an ICT park opened in what was then the suburb of Whitefield, about 10 miles (16 km) east of central Bengaluru. As a self-contained city with hundreds of technology, software, and telecommunications companies, the park became known as the Silicon Valley of India. It became a district of Greater Bengaluru in 2007. The rapid growth of ICT-related activities in the area, however\u2014encouraged by continued government subsidies\u2014contributed to a decline in small- and medium-scale manufacturing industries there. Bengaluru is situated at the focus of southern India\u2019s road and rail systems. It lies on the main north-south national highway through central India, is connected by major roads with Mumbai (Bombay; northwest) and Chennai (Madras; east), and is linked to Kerala state (southwest) via Mysuru (Mysore), through the Nilgiri Hills and Palghat Gap. It is also a regional rail hub, with lines radiating in all directions. Kempegowda International Airport Bengaluru, about 25 miles (40 km) north-northeast of central Bengaluru, opened in 2008, replacing the older Hindustan Airport east of the city centre. The city has a fairly extensive bus network, and taxis and rickshaws are easily accessible. The first portion of a rapid-transit commuter rail system\u2014an east-west line\u2014was inaugurated in central Bengaluru in 2011. A second, north-south line was opened in phases in 2014\u201315. Bangalore University (succeeding a branch of the University of Mysore, founded 1916) was opened in 1964, as was the University of Agricultural Sciences. The city also has several evening colleges and a public library and is the site of the Indian Institute of Science (1909), the Raman Research Institute (1943), the National Aeronautical Research Laboratory (1960), and a division of the National Power Research Institute (1960). Private universities proliferated in the early 21st century. In addition, Bengaluru is a centre for publishing (newspapers and periodicals) and is the regional headquarters of the national radio broadcasting network. It also has a number of other radio and television broadcasting stations. Bengaluru is also home to several sporting stadiums and governing bodies. India\u2019s National Cricket academy is located at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in the city, which hosts cricket matches at both the domestic and the international level. The city has played host to international professional tennis matches, in addition to housing the Bangalore Rugby Club and a domestic-level football (soccer) stadium. The surrounding region is drained by the Arkavati and Kanva rivers, which are tributaries of the Kaveri River. Millet and oilseeds are the main crops, and cattle and sheep are grazed. In addition, granite exports are sustained by the large number of quarries in and around the city."], "https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-14-pro/6.7-inch-display-512gb-deep-purple-unlocked": ["  Carrier-connected iPhone\u00a0SE, iPhone\u00a012, iPhone\u00a013, iPhone\u00a013 mini, iPhone\u00a014 and iPhone\u00a014 Pro models will arrive ready to activate with eSIM and can connect to your cellular voice and data service without a physical SIM card.

Learn how the long-coming and inevitable shift to electric impacts you.\n \nWhether you want to build your own home theater or just learn more about TVs, displays, projectors, and more, we've got you covered.\n \nGet tech's top stories in 30 seconds:\n \nIdentifying the strengths of the underlying technology of a cell phone\u00a0is simple as long as you understand the meaning of 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G,\u00a0and 5G. 1G refers to the first generation of wireless cellular technology, 2G refers to the second generation of technology, and so on. As you might expect, subsequent generations are faster and contain improved or new features. Most wireless carriers currently support both 4G and 3G technology, which is handy when your location allows your phone to operate only at 3G speeds.\n \nSince 1G was introduced in the early 1980s, a new wireless mobile telecommunications technology has been released roughly every 10 years.\u00a0All of them refer to the technology used by the mobile carrier and device itself. They have different speeds and features that improve on the previous generation. The next generation is 5G, which launched in 2020.\n \nRemember analog phones back in the day? Cell phones began with 1G technology in the 1980s. 1G is the first generation of wireless cellular technology. 1G supports voice only calls.\n \n1G is analog technology, and the phones using it had poor battery life and voice quality, little security, and were prone to dropped calls.\n \nThe maximum speed of 1G technology is 2.4 Kbps.\n \nCell phones received their first major upgrade when their technology went from 1G to 2G. This leap took place in Finland in 1991 on GSM networks and effectively took cell phones from analog to digital communications.\n \nThe 2G telephone technology introduced call and text encryption, along with data services such as\u00a0SMS, picture messages, and MMS.\n \nAlthough 2G replaced 1G and is superseded by later technology versions, it's still used around the world.\n \nThe maximum speed of 2G with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is 50 Kbps. The max theoretical speed is 384 Kbps with Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE).\u00a0EDGE+ can get up to 1.3 Mbps.\n \nBefore making the major leap from 2G to 3G wireless networks, the lesser-known 2.5G and 2.75G were\u00a0interim standards that bridged the gap to make data transmission \u2014 slow data transmission \u2014 possible.\n \n2.5G introduced a new packet-switching technique that was more efficient than 2G technology. This led to 2.75G, which provided a theoretical threefold speed increase. AT&T was the first GSM network to support 2.75G with EDGE in the U.S.\u00a0\n \n2.5G and 2.75G were not defined formally as wireless standards. They served mostly as marketing tools to promote new cell phone features to the public.\n \nThe introduction of 3G networks in 1998 ushered in faster data-transmission speeds, so you could use your cell phone in more data-demanding ways such as for video calling and mobile internet access. The term \"mobile broadband\" was first applied to 3G cellular technology.\n \nLike 2G, 3G evolved into the much faster 3.5G and 3.75G as more features were introduced to bring about 4G.\n \nThe maximum speed of 3G was around 2 Mbps for non-moving devices and 384 Kbps in moving vehicles.\u00a0\n \nThe fourth generation of networking, which was released in 2008, is 4G. It supports mobile web access like 3G does and also gaming services, HD mobile TV, video conferencing, 3D TV, and other features that demand high\u00a0speeds.\n \nThe max speed of a 4G network when the device is moving is 100 Mbps. The speed is 1 Gbps for low-mobility communication such as when the caller is stationary or walking.\n \nMost current cell phone models support both 4G and 3G technologies.\n \n5G is a wireless technology with a limited rollout that's intended to improve on 4G.\u00a0\n \n5G promises significantly faster data rates, higher connection density, much lower latency,\u00a0and energy savings, among other improvements.\n \nThe anticipated theoretical speed of 5G connections is up to 20 Gbps per second.\n  2G networks are being closed down worldwide to save operational costs and use radio frequencies for new networks. For instance, AT&T and T-Mobile will phase out their 2G networks by 2022. As a result, some older devices will no longer be able to connect. The iPhone, retroactively named the iPhone 2G, was the first iPhone model offered by Apple.

Fact: FALSE. Modi's family has confirmed that his father died of bone cancer in 1989 and at that time Modi was away on Kailash Mansarovar yatra but came back for the funeral. *** A purported newspaper clipping blaming Narendra Modi for his father's death that has resurfaced on social media amid the Lok Sabha election. The article, published in Hindi (without a date or a byline) is headlined: \u201c\u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u092d\u093e\u0908 \u092c\u0939\u0928 \u0928\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0939\u0940 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u093f\u0924\u093e\u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u094c\u0924 \u0915\u093e \u091c\u093f\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u093e\u0928\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u00a0(Narendra Modi\u2019s brothers and sister blame him for their father\u2019s death)\". The article says that Modi\u2019s father, Damodardas Mulchand Modi, used to make ends meet by pickpocketing and stealing coal and iron from a railway station where he worked as a tea seller. He traded the stolen items for gold, which, in turn, were stolen by Modi when he was young. His father, unable to cope with his son\u2019s actions, suffered a cardiac arrest. The family could not get back the stolen gold despite lodging an FIR and Damodardas subsequently died because the family couldn't afford the medical expenses. The story also claims that former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee suppressed the case and dismissed an FIR against Modi in 1996. The article's snapshot was shared by multiple social media users over various platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp. However, fact-checking website AltNews traced back the article to have been first shared in 2017 by a Congress member named\u00a0Velaram M Patel on Facebook.  The AltNews report says when they contacted Modi's family to verify the claims made in the article, his elder brother Soma Modi said, \"My father had bone cancer and died in 1989.\u201d He added that the prime minister was at Kailash Mansarovar Yatra at the time.\u00a0This information was confirmed by Modi\u2019s younger brother Prahlad Modi to\u00a0Alt News. \u201cThis is completely false,\u201d he asserted. \u201cOur father died in 1989 of bone cancer. Narendra was an RSS pracharak at the time and was home for father\u2019s funeral.\u201d According to Modi's biographer Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay's book\u00a0\u00a0Narendra Modi: The Man, the Times, Modi left his village and broke away from his family in 1967. He came home for a few hours in 1989 when his father passed away. The book also says that Modi had just returned from his pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar when his father was on his death bed. \u201cI gave him sacred water from Mansarovar,\u201d the book quotes Modi. It adds that in 1989, when Damodardas passed away, Modi was General Secretary, Organisation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Boom Live has also called the story fake and pointed out that there is no media agency called 'The Delhi News Network' (as mentioned in the dateline of the article) and it is a fictitious name created to lend credence to the fake article.

The entire Lok Kalyan Marg is also named as Delhi Race Course, which is now closed to the public. Rajiv Gandhi was the first PM to stay at Lok Kalyan Marg in 1984 and now it is the present residence of Narendra Modi since 26th May 2014. Whereas protocol is the system of rules governing formal occasions or the accepted way to behave in a particular situation. SPG is headed by Secretary; decide protocols for PM activities, developing operating procedures and delineating responsibilities of multiple agencies involved in various aspects of security. These provisions are contained in the Blue Book which lays down the security guidelines for the protection of the PM. Benefits given to former Prime Minister and President of India Interesting facts about the residence & protocol of PM: \u2022 The bungalows of the Prime Minister\u2019s residence at 7 Lok Kalyan Marg is designed by Robert Tor Russell, who was the part of British architect Edwin Lutyen\u2019s team, when he was designing New Delhi in the 1920s and 1930s. \u2022 Do you know that 7 Lok Kalyan Marg became the Prime Minister\u2019s official residence during Prime Minister VP Singh\u2019s tenure? He permanently converted the place as the PM\u2019s residence. Before him, the Prime Ministers lived at the other bungalows allotted to them as MPs.  Source: www.google.co.in \u2022 7 Lok Kalyan Marg consists of 5 bungalows 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 lined with putranjiva trees; 5\u00a0Lok Kalyan Marg at present is the Private Residential Zone for our PM and 7th is his office. Bungalow 9 is occupied by the Special Protection Group (SPG), the elite force responsible for the Prime Minister\u2019s security, is housed and also has a tennis court. Bungalow 3 is the guest house for the PM\u2019s guests. Bungalow 1,Lok Kalyan Marg is a helipad for the service of PM which is being used since 2003. \u2022 These bungalows are not big bungalows. His house consists of two bedrooms, an additional room, a dining room and the main living room that can accommodate about 30 people. \u2022 Interestingly, around 2 km long underground tunnel which connects the Indian Prime Minister\u2019s residence to Safdarjung Airport where WIP helicopters land was constructed to reduce the traffic congestion. It is constructed beyond Kamal Ataturk Marg, Golf Course and Safdarjung Tomb and then an underground drive to surface at the helicopter hanger at the airport. Work of this tunnel was begun in 2010 and was completed by July 2014. Also, Narendra Modi is the first PM to use it.

They are massive, manicured and big enough to run a horse. The abundant gulmohar, semal and arjuna trees grown in the premises are also the home to several birds, including peacocks. And there is only one entrance to 7 Lok Kalyan Marg and that too is guarded by SPG.  Source: www.google.com \u2022 The workplace at 7 Lok Kalyan Marg has two small rooms on either side as you enter for each 2 personal secretaries. Visitor room is on the right side. Further ahead is a chamber to meet the guests. Adjacent to that is the living space for larger meetings, behind which is the dining room where breakfast and lunch meetings are hosted. \u2022 A corridor from 7\u00a0 Lok Kalyan Marg takes you to panchavati which can be segmented into two or three conference rooms or a larger banquet hall. On the walls are artworks loaned by the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA). During visits PM collects a no. of gifts, received paintings, mementos, metallic bowls etc which are either displayed at 7\u00a0 Lok Kalyan Marg or sent to toshakhana (Treasure house)  \u2022 When you enter\u00a0 Lok Kalyan Marg the first building that you enter is 9 RCR. Further ahead is the parking and then the reception area. Beyond this is the even more heavily guarded enclosed space that houses 7, 5, 3 and 1 Lok Kalyan Marg. Even relatives can\u2019t be dropped without unannounced. Friends also can\u2019t come up to meet PM. Only those visitors whose names have been given to SPG by the PM\u2019s personal secretaries are allowed in. This rule applied to everyone including security adviser, top bureaucrats, relatives and guests. And visitors are expected to carry an identity card.  Source:www.images.indianexpress.com \u2022 Once this barrier is crossed, SPG ferries the visitor to the PM. There is a dedicated fleet of cars- Tata Nanos, at one point of time for that. And the whole area is no-fly zone. Even the residential bungalow has an additional security and nearby high-rise hotel Samrat the top four floors are taken over by the government. \u2022 This fenced fortress offers many perks that many other big bungalows can only dream of like it has a power station, doctors and nurses from All India Institute of Medical Sciences on duty round the clock and an ambulance on standby that always accompanies the PM\u2019s motorcade- it include six BMW\u2019s. This all was made to order at the Vajpayee tenure. Two BMW\u2019s are used by the PM in Delhi, two are for VIP guests and the remaining two are flown with the PM wherever he travels in the country.

The reason it garnered such attention was not only because it promised to give a glimpse into the life of Narendra Modi, who was, until then an inaccessible political figure not particularly open to doing many interviews, but also because Marino, who was a relatively unknown Britsih writer, was selected as the biographer of a man who would soon become the most important politicians of the country. The book chronicles Modi\u2019s early years, his induction into the RSS, his career in Gujarat politics, and his journey towards the prime ministership of India. The writer claims that he had interviewed Modi for several hours while researching and writing this book. While most of the things related to Modi\u2019s political career which is stated in this book is public knowledge now, Marino\u2019s writings also give an insight into the emotional turmoil and the family issues Modi faced in the path of his political journey. On his 70th birthday, let\u2019s revisit the book that chronicles Modi\u2019s early days of induction into RSS, his desire to join a Sainik school, and how it weighed in on his relationship with his father. In the book, Narendra Modi, A Political Biography, Marino writes, \u201cThe attraction to the RSS was, at the age of eight, obviously not political in the sense of hewing to a particular ideological position. Narendra came to the RSS by way of contact, at the age of six, with a Congressman named Rasikbhai Dave, whose office was close to his father\u2019s tea stall at the railway station. It was a time of agitation for a separate Gujarat state, then part of the Bombay State. Gujarat would earn statehood in May 1960, a few months before Narendra\u2019s tenth birthday. He (Narendra) collected pro-Gujarat lapel badges from Dave and then acted as his \u2018agent\u2019, distributing them to his school friends.\" Interview: Authors of Sanjeev Kumar\u2019s Biography Decode His Life And Career\u00a0 Mindful Interactions May Lead to a Harmonious Workplace, says Study The book states: Politics may look distant and hazy to a six-year-old boy \u2013 this was 1956 \u2013 but helping to create your own state would be something he could grasp. \u2018I got a sense of participation,\u2019 recalls Modi. \u2018But there was no deep political understanding.\u2019 It was in the evenings, after he finished helping his father at the tea stall, that Narendra, a couple of years later, began to attend the local youth meetings of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. That part of the RSS that caters for an eight-year-old is best described as a sort of Boy Scouts group. Yet it is part of a larger organization that is right-wing, nationalistic and ideological. The name literally means \u2018National Volunteer Organization\u2019. The RSS was banned in 1948 in the aftermath of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s assassination by one of its former members, Nathuram Godse, yet it was also commended for averting a coup against Nehru. Acquitted by the Supreme Court of involvement in Gandhi\u2019s murder, the ban on the RSS was revoked by the government in return for formalizing itself with a constitution. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, then home minister, advised the RSS to stay out of politics and remain a sociocultural organization. By the time Narendra began to attend its local shakha most evenings, where he would have been one of the youngest participants, the RSS was acquiring quiet respectability as a disciplined force. It was the kind of environment, of ideas and debate at RSS meetings, rather than the rote learning of school, that stimulated him. There he could learn more about worldly matters, and perhaps congregate with the adults who fascinated him. It was during this phase of his life that he met his guide and mentor in RSS, Laxmanrao Inamdar or \u2018Vakil Saheb\u2019 as he was popularly known. Inamdar was instrumental in inducting young Modi as a \u2018balswayamsevak\u2019, a junior cadet. In the book, the author writes: \u2026Aged thirteen, Narendra was about to leave Vadnagar Primary School No. 1 for the local high school, and at such a juncture the idea of applying instead to a junior officers\u2019 academy was not entirely outlandish. It was exactly the sort of idea that would have been inspired in Narendra by attendance at RSS shakha evenings. But his father, Damodardas, forbade the move. The Sainik school was quite a distance away, in the Jamnagar district on the Gulf of Kutch, which meant Narendra moving away to board there. The cost \u2013 there was not a spare rupee in the Modi household \u2013 or perhaps the awareness of the social divide, also gave Damodardas pause. Modi\u2019s father\u2019s refusal to send him to Sainik School coincided with the news of Modi\u2019s childhood betrothal with a girl from a nearby village, about which he wasn\u2019t informed beforehand. The book states: The tradition of childhood betrothal among Gujarati Ghanchis still exists, but in the 1950s and 1960s was more deeply ingrained than today. Narendra at three years of age had been \u2018engaged\u2019 by his parents to a girl from a nearby town. He was not made aware of it until many years later. The girl\u2019s name, courtesy a tabloid, was revealed in a 2009 \u2018scoop\u2019 to be Jashodaben. There would have been a ritual or symbolic formalization of the agreement between the two families when the children were on the cusp of their teenage years \u2013 an engagement, but not the same thing as a wedding between a bride and a groom of legally marriageable age. This was exactly when Narendra was told the Sainik military school was out of bounds to him. Some years later would come a meeting, with many family members present, during which he could have the opportunity to observe his betrothed but not necessarily speak to her. The final stage, signalled by Jashodaben turning eighteen, would be the commencement of an initial period of cohabitation. Whatever actually happened, the chronology of events suggests that as soon as Narendra fully understood the situation he decided, literally, to make his move. He abruptly left Vadnagar and his family home when he was seventeen and Jashodaben only fifteen years old. As one observer put it: \u2018It was a child marriage, and neither was it consummated nor was there cohabitation. Modi refused and went away as he was never interested in marrying. A case of null and void.\u2019 The tradition of leaving home at an early age to seek spiritual knowledge is part of both Hindu and Buddhist faiths \u2013 as the examples of Lord Ram and the Buddha attest. In the book, the author concludes: \u2026Chronology is the first element of deduction, and careful consideration suggests the abandoned betrothal, within the tightly knit and traditional Ganchi society in mid-twentieth century Vadnagar, was likely the breaking point. Exactly how healthy relations between father and son were even before that, however, is uncertain. Was there some lingering resentment on Narendra\u2019s part over the decision to deny him entrance to the Sainik school? Did that disappointment compound with the disagreement over Jashodaben? More importantly was Narendra\u2019s increasing focus on the RSS, and his developing friendship with Vakil Saheb, an additional source of friction? Significantly or even emblematically, Modi still remembers how very disappointed his parents were when he missed Diwali celebrations one year. It was the very day that Vakil Saheb was inducting Narendra into the RSS and repeating the vows with him. Damodardas might have felt his son\u2019s choice only as a small betrayal or disobedience, but as Narendra spent increasing amounts of time at the RSS shakha before he took off on his two-year sojourn, a sense of rejection on his father\u2019s part could have been reinforced to the point where the relationship was severely strained. Inevitably fathers see their sons growing up and slipping away, escaping their influence, and sometimes a fierce love causes them to resent it. When it also happens that a replacement father figure is involved, especially one so locally glamorous as Vakil Saheb, the hurt can be significant and the paternal feelings of redundancy and emotional loss powerful. Yet the fulfillment of the son\u2019s new direction can often lead to great things. The tragedy, however, lies only in long-term alienation, especially when death intervenes.

For more information on your mobile providers' plans for 3G retirement and how you can prepare, contact your provider directly. Mobile carriers are shutting down their 3G networks, which rely on older technology, to make room for more advanced network services, including 5G. As a result, many older cell phones will be unable to make or receive calls and texts, including calls to 911, or use data services. This will affect 3G mobile phones and certain older 4G mobile phones that do not support Voice over LTE (VoLTE or HD Voice). Learn more about other connected devices, such as medical devices and home security systems that may be impacted below. Some mobile providers have already completed the shutdown of their 3G networks, while others are scheduled to occur later in 2022. Plans and timing to phase out 3G services will vary by company and may change. Consult your mobile provider's website for the most up-to-date information. If your mobile carrier is not listed here, you may still be affected. Many carriers, such as Cricket, Boost, Straight Talk, and several Lifeline mobile service providers, utilize AT&T's, Verizon's, and T-Mobile's networks. In addition, international visitors to the United States with 3G phones will be affected and are urged to plan accordingly. Note: These are dates for completing the shutdowns. Carriers may begin retiring parts of their networks sooner.  Contact your mobile provider or consult your provider's website for more information about their 3G retirement plan and whether your phone, or other connected device, may be affected. It is important to plan now so that you don't lose connectivity, including the ability to call 911. Some carrier websites provide lists of devices that will no longer be supported after 3G networks are shut down. You may need to upgrade to a newer device to ensure that you can stay connected, and carriers may be offering discounted or free upgrades to help consumers who need to upgrade their phones. Some devices may only require a software update to enable VoLTE (HD Voice) or other advanced services. If you purchased your phone independent of a mobile provider, you should be able to check whether your device is 4G LTE (with VoLTE or HD Voice) enabled by checking your phone's settings or user manual, or by searching your phone's model number on the internet, to determine whether you need to purchase a new device or install a software update. No, other devices, such as certain medical devices, tablets, smart watches, vehicle SOS services, home security systems, and other connected products may be using 3G network services. And don't forget about devices that use cellular connectivity as a back-up when a wired internet connection goes down. If the device is not labeled, contact the monitoring company or other service provider to confirm how the device connects and whether your device may be impacted. As mobile carriers seek to upgrade their networks to use the latest technologies, they periodically shut down older services, such as 3G, to free up spectrum and infrastructure to support new services, such as 5G. Similar transitions have happened before. For example, some mobile carriers shut down their 2G networks when they upgraded their networks to support 4G services. Mobile carriers have the flexibility to choose the types of technologies and services they deploy, including when they decommission older services in favor of newer services to meet consumer demands. As mentioned above, your mobile service provider may be offering special deals on new devices, including some deals that might include a free cell phone. In addition, although they do not cover the cost of new devices, other FCC programs may be able to assist eligible consumers with the cost of phone or internet services: Additional Resources To learn more about 5G, visit our FAQs page.

For an LTE radio system to facilitate bidirectional communication, it is necessary to implement a duplex scheme so that a device may transmit and receive without collision. In order to achieve high data rates, LTE operates full duplex\u00a0whereby both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) communication takes place simultaneously by separating DL and UL traffic either by frequency (i.e., FDD), or time periods (i.e., TDD).While less efficient and more electrically complex to deploy,\u00a0FDD tends to be more commonly deployed by operators due to refarming of existing 3G spectrum arrangements. By comparison, deploying TDD requires less spectrum as well as eliminating\u00a0then need for guard bands permitting a more efficient stacking of spectrum. UL/DL capacity can also be dynamically adjusted to match demand simply by devoting more airtime to one over the other. However, transmission timing must be synchronised between base stations, introducing\u00a0complexity, along with guard periods being required between DL and UL subframes, which reduces capacity. The continuing evolution of\u00a0carrier aggregation\u00a0has resulted in several new bands added, including B29, B32, B67, and B69\u00a0used for downlink-only\u00a0carrier aggregation, termed Supplemental DL bands[5]. Supplemental DL bands 252 and 255 have been included as part of the LTE-U expansion into unlicensed 5 GHz bands\u00a0U-NII-1 and U-NII-3, respectively. The below table lists Frequency Division Duplex LTE bands, compiled from 3GPP 36.101 (Rel. 16) [April 2019], and LTE-U SDL Technical Report.\u00a0 The increasing asymmetric demand for downlink data has also resulted in the introduction of\u00a0Band 46, a downlink-only Supplemental DL\u00a0band operating in the 5 GHz U-NII\u00a0frequency range. Band 47 has\u00a0been introduced for applications such as Vehicle to Everything (V2X)\u00a0communications, which is positioned in\u00a0the\u00a0U-NII-3 5 GHz unlicensed\u00a0band. Cellular V2X (C-V2X) may require the use of unlicensed bands to solve regulatory issues related to LTE-Direct, where\u00a0devices broadcast\u00a0directly to nearby devices[6]. Like all unlicensed band LTE\u00a0technologies, V2X operates Band 47 only in carrier aggregation with the operator's licensed band. The below table lists Time Division Duplex LTE bands, compiled from 3GPP 36.101 (Rel. 16) [April 2019].

With technology becoming more reachable to customers, almost every new smartphone now comes with a multiple-camera setup on the rear to support portrait mode. However, despite two or even three cameras we\u2019ve seen some examples of failed edge detection, a dedicated depth sensor can greatly help resolve this issue and give better results. Over the past few years, smartphone cameras have become extremely promising. New smartphones these days come with high-resolution cameras capable of shooting videos in 4K and even 8K HDR, however, the one thing missing from these smartphones until recent times was the Bokeh effect produced by the large sensor and lens on a DSLR.  In the past few years, an increased number of smartphones have started coming with a dual-camera setup allowing them to get a perception of depth in a photo and apply a software bokeh to the image.  While this can look great in some cases, it can be a massive failure in some attempts. With further advancements in smartphone cameras, new devices are coming with a dedicated depth sensor to better track the depth in a particular scene and apply the software bokeh accordingly.  These are mainly of two types, either a dedicated ToF (Time of Flight) sensor or a depth-sensing camera. In this article, we check out the top 10 smartphones in the market right now that have a dedicated depth sensor.\u00a0 The Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra comes with one of the best camera setups in the market right now, the device not only has a 108MP primary sensor but also comes with a 48MP periscope lens that supports 10x hybrid optical zoom or a total of 100x overall zoom.  The smartphone also comes with a 0.3MP TOF 3D sensor with an f/1.0 aperture for depth sensing. A ToF or Time of Flight sensor allows devices to map the image with a 3D depth and offers depth detection for a better bokeh effect.  The smartphone is powered by the Exynos 990 chipset and comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB internal storage in the highest-end variant.

He cleared the examination in 1978 and was awarded the degree in 1979,\" said Tarun Das, the DU registrar. Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Credit: Reuters/Amit Dave  New Delhi: Delhi University on Tuesday put its\u00a0stamp of approval on the authenticity of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bachelor of Arts graduation degree which, along with his MA\u00a0degree in \u201cEntire Political Science\u201d obtained from Gujarat University, was displayed by Union minister Arun Jaitley and BJP president Amit Shah before the media on Monday. The university registrar\u2019s statement came on a day when the the Aam Aadmi Party continued to question\u00a0Modi\u2019s educational qualifications as also the authenticity of the degrees that have come\u00a0into the public domain after AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal wrote\u00a0to the Central Information Commission to complain about the denial of information in the matter. \u201cWe have checked our records and it has been authenticated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s degree is authentic. He cleared the examination in 1978 and was awarded the degree in\u00a01979,\u201d said Tarun Das, the DU registrar. Das\u00a0also sought to make light of the AAP\u2019s claims that the degree was fake because the name on the certificate\u00a0did not match with that in the statement of marks and also that the marks did not tally properly. \u201cWe would like to state that Narendra Damodardas Modi had qualified for \u00a0the degree of Bachelors in Arts. His enrolment number was CC 594/74 and his examination roll number was 16594,\u201d the registrar\u00a0said, putting the record straight. His assertion came hours after AAP leaders Sanjay Singh and Ashutosh \u2013 who on Monday had pointed to some alleged irregularities in the degrees shown by Jaitley and Shah and termed them fake \u2013\u00a0went to the Delhi University to scrutinise the documents. The two AAP leaders wanted to meet vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi but were told that he was busy. Returning from the campus, Singh questioned why the university was falling shy of revealing the truth on the authenticity of the degrees. \u201cThere is an atmosphere of fear here. If all is well with the degree then why don\u2019t they reveal details?\u201d he claimed. Meanwhile, the prime minister\u2019s\u00a0school education was\u00a0also the subject of speculation on\u00a0social media. Twitter and Facebook were abuzz with questions of\u00a0how Modi\u00a0got admission in Delhi University if he had only passed his Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination \u2013 which many believed was the equivalent of class 10 matriculation. But\u00a0this controversy too appears to have no basis. The Gujarati channel, ABP Asmita recently ran a programme covering Modi\u2019s education. A senior Gujarat journalist said investigations had\u00a0revealed that Modi studied up to class\u00a07 in the\u00a0Boys Primary School, Vadnagar, \u00a0and then did his class 8-11 schooling\u00a0from B.N. Vidyalaya, Vadnagar, getting his SSC from the Gujarat Board in 1967. The report also said he then did a one year pre-science course \u2013 equivalent to class 12 \u2013 from M.N. College, Visnagar. A former student at the\u00a0School of Correspondence, Delhi University, where Modi was enrolled for his BA, Anees Mohammad, told The Wire that it was quite normal at the time for students to be admitted to the DU after passing class 11. Mohammad, who was also a\u00a0National Students Union of India leader at the school, where he had enrolled in 1978, said that\u00a0till 1977, the School of Correspondence used to admit students after class 11 examinations. \u201cThe 10 + 2 system came into being only in 1978 and I was in the first batch to be covered by it. Prior to that we had an 8 + 3 system for higher secondary and after class 11 admission was given in colleges.\u201d Stating that the eligibility for admission was 33%, he also said that pass marks in the distance education were also 33 per cent. Since the question of Modi apparently failing in the third year and taking four years from 1974 to 1978 to complete his graduation has also been raised by the AAP leaders, Mohammad said this\u00a0was quite possible as the number of attempts allowed were many. Moreover, he said, the course also provided for appearing in back papers, in which a student had failed. \u201cIf the total score of a student was more than the pass marks required in a given year, they were promoted to the next class even if they failed in one or two papers. They were then allowed to sit for these back papers in the subsequent years.\u201d"], "https://szbailing.en.alibaba.com/product/60715176698-805012044/GSM_GPRS_4G_EC25_E_module_B1_B3_B5_B7_B8_B20_RS232_DB9_serial_port_LTE_FDD_modem.html": [" \n Alibaba.com Site: International - Espa\u00f1ol - Portugu\u00eas - Deutsch - Fran\u00e7ais - Italiano - \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 - P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 - \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 - \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e - \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 - \u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 - T\u00fcrk - Nederlands - ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t - Indonesian - \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea\n \nAliExpress\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\t|\n\t\t    \t\t1688.com\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\t|\n\t\t    \t\tTmall Taobao World\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\t|\n\t\t    \t\tAlipay\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\n\t\t    \t\t|\n\t\t    \t\tLazada\n \n\t\t\t    Browse Alphabetically:\n\t\t\t\tOnetouch\n\t\t\t    | Showroom\n\t\t\t    | Country Search\n\t\t\t    | Suppliers\n\t\t\t    | Affiliate\n \n\n\t\t\t\tProduct Listing Policy\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t- \n\t\t\t\tIntellectual Property Protection\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t- \n\t\t\t\tPrivacy Policy\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- \n\t\t\t\tTerms of Use\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t- User Information Legal Enquiry Guide\n \n\n\u00a9 1999-2022 Alibaba.com.

No products in the cart. If you have fiddled with the built-in flash on your camera or with an external flash unit, you may have probably heard about the term flash sync. For the uninitiated, flash sync or, as it is sometimes referred to, flash sync speed is nothing more than syncing the speed of the flash with that of the shutter on your camera. There is some advantages in doing it. The shutter on your camera is composed of two curtains \u2013 the front and the rear. They are sometimes also referred to as the first and the second curtain. When you press the shutter button it activates a mechanism that moves the first curtain. It in effect exposes the sensor to light coming through the barrel of the lens. Once the first curtain has reached the other end, the rear (or second) curtain starts to travel. It covers the sensor and it is no longer sensitized by light. Ok, now we understand what the curtains do, but how does it relate to flash and what\u2019s rear curtain sync? More importantly, why rear curtain sync is important to learn? Rear curtain sync is basically syncing the flash so that it fires just before the rear curtain starts to move. Ok, so how is that expected to impact your photography? Read on. You are shooting at your daughter\u2019s birthday party. She is in a playful mood with her friends. The room is lit with home lights and basically something that isn\u2019t good enough for a proper exposure without a flash. So you mount an external flash to your camera. Now, the problem is with your Nikon you are limited to a shutter speed of 1/250 of a second (1/200 of a second for Canon cameras) or less. This is because of the flash-sync speed limitation I discussed in an earlier article. This creates a problem, especially if you use the default shutter mechanism, i.e.; front curtain sync. What happens is the flash fires immediately after the first curtain has finished traveling. So, the flash fires, freezing the subject, but as the rear curtain moves over the course of the next fraction of a second, the movement of the subject (remember, she is in a playful mood) is captured as a blur. You are shooting light trails in low light conditions. But you decide to use the flash to freeze the movement of some of the cars in the shot. If you use the default front curtain sync, the flash will fire first, freezing the cars. But the lens will remain open and continue to make the exposure. This will result in the front lights to appear shooting out but the backlights will appear protruding into the car. This is unacceptable. To avoid these problems rear-curtain sync is used. In the first scenario the flash will fire at the end of the exposure, freezing the subject and the blur of the initial movements, though recorded, will come after the subject has been frozen. In the second instance, the backlights will appear more natural, coming after the car and not shooting into it. Needless to say, both are more natural and are thus acceptable. You would argue that the blur is unavoidable in either of the technique, so why do we have to shoot in rear curtain sync and not in the default front curtain sync. The thing is blur, if any, is acceptable right after the subject and not in front of it. That\u2019s not natural. In 90% of low light situations, rear curtain sync thus gives a more appropriate result compared to front curtain sync. Your email address will not be published.

He has been representing the Prime Minister of India since 2014. He served as Gujarat's chief minister for thirteen years before becoming the Prime Minister of India. Narendra Modi is the only Prime Minister after Ex-Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who has been elected as the Prime Minister of India by a single vote. Childhood Life: Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on September 17, 1950, in an ordinary family in Vadnagar, Gujarat. His father's name was Damodardas Murlichand Modi, who was a tea seller by profession and his mother Hiraben Modi was a housewife. Narendra Modi is the third of his parents' six children. Due to poverty, he used to sell tea with his father at Vadnagar railway station. Student Life:\u00a0 In 1967, he passed his high school from a school in Vadnagar. At the age of eight, he discovered the RSS or the State Volunteer Association. He too joined here and was met by a man named Lakshman Inamdar, who appointed him as its servant. He graduated from the Open Learning School in Delhi in 1978 with a degree in political science. Marital Life: Modi was married to Jashodaben Chimanlal at an early age. But they did not live together for long. It is also said that they were never married. He confessed Jashodaben as his wife during the election in 2014. Political Life: In 1975, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency, Modi was appointed as the editor of the 'Gujarat Lok Sabha Samiti'. As a result, he had to travel around various places in disguise. He helped the BJP in campaigning in the municipal elections by 1986 and after helping the BJP, his mind was drawn to being a political leader. Then in 1987 he was elected as the editor of the BJP team.\u00a0 In 1990, he was appointed a member of the BJP's National Election Committee. He then established a school in collaboration with Shankar Singh Vaghela, BJP MP from Gujarat. After that, in 1999, Modi had participated in the Gujarat Assembly elections for the BJP. He won in this vote. After the victory, he was appointed the national secretary of the BJP and took over the party affairs of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, including Delhi. He took over as Gujarat Chief Minister, winning the elections in 2001.\u00a0 The following year, riots broke out in the state of Gujarat, causing many ordinary people to die. Modi blamed the Muslim people for the riots, saying it was a terrorist attack. The day after the tragic incident, the strike called and the people of Gujarat became Muslim haters. Modi tried to fulfill the damage caused by the riots. But the riots case went to court, centered on the complexity of Modi's involvement in the riots, but Modi was acquitted for lack of evidence.\u00a0 Then there was the election of 2014. For the second time, Modi again sworn in as Chief Minister after winning a huge vote. Thus, after serving as Chief Minister of Gujarat for a long thirteen years, the best moment of his life finally came. He was elected as the Prime Minister of India by winning the Lok Sabha by a huge margin. He was sworn in as Prime Minister on May 25 this year and took over the Indian government. In the first year of his rule, his goal was to investigate all domestic and foreign companies. He then repealed almost 120 such laws, which were completely obsolete. He started the 'Digital India' project to improve various government services. Through this project, he focused on improving the production of electric commodities, increasing literacy rate, speeding internet access, providing free LPG to the residents of the village.\u00a0 In order to improve the economic sector, he expanded his foreign investment policies, and even promoted foreign investment in defense and railways. Encouraging foreign goods to be spelled as Indian products. In the first year of his rule, the GDP stood at 12.5%. The expenditure on health and family welfare is reduced by about 15% and the budget for education programs is reduced by 22%. Also sitting in the first cabinet meeting, he decided to investigate black money. As a result, to cancel the use of black money, cancel the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes and launch new notes. In 2018, he had launched the 'Ayusman Bharat Yojana' project. He started campaigning for a 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' from which he was still active. Through this project, he landed in the countryside for the purpose of creating free toilets in the countryside, so that ordinary people are not allowed to leave the stool, urine.\u00a0 From his swearing-in, he emphasized foreign policy, and on his swearing-in he invited the prime ministers of all countries. He was the only Prime Minister in India's history to do so. To make this policy more effective, he traveled to different countries and attended various conferences and signed agreements. He was again elected as prime minister for the second time, winning by a single majority.

Most commonly used to sense when a phone is held up to the users ear to turn off the display.  This saves both battery life and prevents accidental screen touches. Accelerometer and gyroscope Accelerometers in mobile phones are used to detect the orientation of the phone. The gyroscope, or gyro for short, adds an additional dimension to the information supplied by the accelerometer by tracking rotation or twist.  An accelerometer measures linear acceleration of movement, while a gyro on the other hand measures the angular rotational velocity. Both sensors measure rate of change; they just measure the rate of change for different things. In practice, that means that an accelerometer will measure the directional movement of a device but will not be able to resolve its lateral orientation or tilt during that movement accurately unless a gyro is there to fill in that info.  With an accelerometer you can either get a really \"noisy\" info output that is responsive, or you can get a \"clean\" output that's sluggish. But when you combine the 3-axis accelerometer with a 3-axis gyro, you get an output that is both clean and responsive in the same time.\" Accelerometers are also used to provide 'steps' information for a vendors 'health' application. Digital compass The digital compass that's usually based on a sensor called the magnetometer and provides mobile phones with a simple orientation in relation to the Earth's magnetic field. As a result, your phone always knows which way is North so it can auto rotate your digital maps depending on your physical orientation.  Barometer The barometer assists the GPS chip inside the device to get a faster lock by instantly delivering altitude data. Additionally,\r\n\r\nthe barometer can be utilized to provide 'floors climbed' information to a phones 'health' app. the barometer can be utilized to provide 'floors climbed' information to a phones 'health' app. With the advent of more accurate indoor navigation, the barometer can assist in determine what floor a user is on within an airport for example. Biometrics Biometric related sensors provide levels of enhanced security by capturing and validating human related metrics.  Including Finger Print recognition, IRIS (eye) scanning and full facial recognition. Biometric sensors provide a more secure but more convenient way to unlock phones and pay for purchases. Additionally, biometric sensors can be used to collect a users heart rate and SpO2 (the estimate of arterial oxygen saturation) for use within a vendors 'health' application. Augmented & Virtual Reality The highly accurate sensors detailed above, when combined with the powerful CPU & GPU's of modern smart phones, allow very realist and responsive Virtual Reality applications to be created.  When the sensors are combined with a smartphones camera they facilitate Augmented Reality applications.

So here\u2019s what you need to know about cameras and their MP. MP refers to the megapixel, which is the measurement of a camera\u2019s resolution. 1 megapixel is the equivalent of 1 million pixels. So the higher the megapixel count (1MP, 2MP, etc.), the better the resolution the camera has.  In general, with each increase in MP, the resolution increases by 1 million pixels. Here\u2019s a quick list of the megapixels and their respective height and width dimensions in screens.   So should you get a 4MP or 8MP? Well, it depends on what you need the camera for. As a general rule of thumb, a higher resolution is better, but that also means you have to account for more storage and bandwidth. In situations where you want a clearer picture, a higher resolution camera is preferable. But in situations where you may only need to see basic movement, lower resolutions may be preferable to save bandwidth. If you are going to show it on a large monitor the higher resolutions will make a difference. We start off most people with 4MP Cameras now and then we can discuss if they have a need for 8MP. Also, if you want the ability to virtually zoom in and get more data you will also want as many pixels as you can like the 8MP/4K cameras. (Not to be confused with optical zoom, which varifocal and pan tilt zoom cameras can do) And of course, pricing can come into play. The higher the resolution, the more expensive the camera will usually be. So, it also comes down to what you\u2019re willing to pay for and how much budget you have for your cameras. Need help in choosing a camera with the right resolution? Talk to us and we can help you out in getting the best security cameras for your setup.

Mr. Patel said, \u201cMr. Modi was enrolled in the Gujarat University for post-graduation only, so we don\u2019t have details of his B.A.\u201d Asked why the varsity had rejected dozens of applications under the Right to Information Act, he said, \u201cThe details of the marks and degree can only be shared with the candidate himself, and the varsity does not maintain records beyond 20 years.\u201d \u201cIn the last seven years, as many as 70 applications on Mr. Modi\u2019s education degree and qualification details under RTI were rejected by the Gujarat University and now all of a sudden, the VC has found his mark sheet and shared it with the media,\u201d Congress spokesman Shaktisinh Gohil said. \u201cHow could he get admission in M.A. in Gujarat University? While filing applications for M.A., he must have attached his B.A. degree. Why is the university not disclosing it,\u201d Mr. Gohil asked. Giving details of the marks break-up, Mr. Patel said, \u201cIn the first year of M.A., he secured 237 out of 400 marks, in the second year, he scored 262 out of 400.\u201d The break-up of marks in the second year shows that Mr. Modi obtained 64 in political science, 62 in European and social political thought, 69 in modern India/political analysis, and 67 in political psychology. According to Mr. Modi\u2019s brother Prahlad, he had enrolled for pre-science in Visnagar in Mehsana district but subsequently had shifted to Ahmedabad. Date of birth row Meanwhile, as per the university records, Mr. Modi\u2019s date of birth is mentioned as August 29, 1949 while as per Mr. Modi\u2019s website and official records, it is September 17, 1950. \u201cWill Mr. Modi clarify which one is genuine and which is fake? The country would certainly want to know the details of his degrees, educational qualifications and real DoB,\u201d Mr. Gohil said. \nCOMMents\n  SHARE\n BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

If you are in the process of buying a new laptop or a computer, you are probably wondering is 512GB enough storage? In today\u2019s day and age, we need more and more storage for various things. Storage is an important aspect of any computer, so you have to pay attention to the type and capacity.\u00a0 Capacity plays a vital role in your computer performance and usefulness. Also, the capacity could significantly raise the overall price of the laptop. Therefore, this article examines if 512GB is enough for an average user. This way, you can decide whether this storage is sufficient for your needs.\u00a0 512GB is enough storage for most users to fulfill all their needs. Is 512GB enough to fulfill your needs? It depends on what you are going to use it for. If you have large files and play a lot of games, then a 512GB SSD is enough. Is 512GB sufficient for programming and gaming? Yes, it is enough for both demanding software and simple everyday tasks.\u00a0 Whether you are a laptop or a desktop user, 512GB is more than enough for your operating system. Today, most people use either Windows 10 or the newest operating system, Windows 11. But you need to know that when you plan to install the Windows operating system, you need to have enough free space.\u00a0 Windows 10 requires only 30GB of storage. Windows 11, on the other hand, needs 64GB of free space on your storage. You might need even more storage for installing updates. So, keep that in mind when you choose a storage capacity.\u00a0 When choosing a storage device, you should be aware of the fact that the advertised storage capacity is not the same as the actual capacity. The manufacturers advertise a certain capacity when in reality, you get less than that number.\u00a0 This difference can be up to 10 percent. Accordingly, when 128GB is advertised, you get about 100GB, 256GB is about 218GB, and 512GB is actually about 456GB.\u00a0 The MacBook Air comes with different SSD capacities. So, you can purchase one with up to 2TB of storage. When choosing capacity, you should be aware of the fact that extra storage capacity can increase the price. So, you should choose the one according to your needs.\u00a0 Most average users will find 256GB sufficient for their needs. However, if you plan to play modern games and store a lot of movies, 512GB would be a better choice.\u00a0 Even though MacBook Pro has various capacities, most people will find 512GB sufficient. Some Pro versions come with 4TB or even 8TB storage which is exactly what professional, demanding users need.\u00a0 A Mac desktop computer with 256GB is simply not enough for everyday tasks. If you opt for this capacity, it will give you headaches in the long run. So, opt for at least 512GB capacity.\u00a0 Students usually use a computer for research, doing homework, tutoring, classes, or learning programs. Unless their studies require some extra demanding software, 512GB should be more than enough for any student. It should be enough to store all the necessary data throughout four years of college.\u00a0 For gaming, on the other hand, it depends on how hard-core you are. It should be enough to store all your games if you are an average player.\u00a0 512GB is enough to store up to 24 PC games. If you use Windows 11, which takes up about 64GB, you will be left with 448GB. If you don\u2019t plan to store over 20 games on your computer, 512GB should be enough.\u00a0 Music production software can take up a lot of storage. If you consider the storage for ongoing projects, you need a significant amount of storage. However, if you don\u2019t want to spend a lot of cash but still want to have enough storage for all of your projects and software, 512GB is a perfect solution.\u00a0 Another good thing about the newer generation of SSDs is their write and read speed, which is very important for music production. On average, good SSDs can provide you with about 500MB/s speed, which is excellent for producing music.\u00a0 A 512GB SSD provides enough storage for music production while simultaneously, it will not cost you a fortune to purchase. Anything less than 512GB would cause you problems. You will need to clean the disc space regularly, which can be tiring.\u00a0 If you plan to do video editing, 512GB is enough storage. Different apps like Adobe Premiere Pro, Apple Final Cut Pro, CyberLink PowerDirector 365, or Corel VideoStudio Ultimate can be installed and used with 512GB storage. However, if you want to store videos, especially when it comes to 4K or 8K videos, you might need more storage. In this case, it is recommended not to use internal storage. Instead, you can purchase external storage, but the one that comes with a bigger capacity. You can purchase an HDD instead of an SSD, which costs less but offers more capacity.\u00a0 It is always better to get an SSD instead of an HDD for programming purposes. The reason for this is speed. When programming, speed is more important than larger capacity. So, if you can\u2019t choose between a large capacity HDD and a smaller capacity SSD, it is always better to choose an SSD.\u00a0 If you plan to use software like GitLab, Bitrise, Flosum, or Bitrise, 512GB is more than enough. Even a 256GB disc could be enough for programming, which means that 512GB is a perfect choice. However, if you need more storage, you can always get yourself external storage.\u00a0 AutoCAD, as 2D and 3D drafting, design, and modeling software, requires space and speed to run smoothly. Since AutoCAD, just like programming, requires speed, an SSD is a far better choice than HDD.\u00a0 There are fast processors, and lots of RAM in modern computers, so slow HDDs can\u2019t keep up with them. In general, it is recommended to get an SSD for the operating system and an external HDD for storing extensive data.\u00a0 AutoCAD, alongside the operating system, has its place on the internal SSD storage. 512GB is enough for AutoCAD. You could even make it with 256GB but complemented with an external 1TB or 2TB HDD.\u00a0 8GB is more than sufficient for simple everyday tasks. However, 8GB is a bare minimum for playing games. And since you can fit only a smaller amount of games on 512GB storage, this combination is unfortunately not enough for gaming. 16GB RAM can meet most of the modern software and gaming requirements. However, if you are not a huge gamer, the 512GB and 16GB RAM should be enough. But if you plan to install more than 10 to 20 different games, you might want to consider getting at least 1TB of hard drive space.\u00a0 People don\u2019t often check their computer storage. However, it is sometimes necessary for storage management or making your computer run smoothly. If your storage is full, your computer might slow down.\u00a0 You can easily check the status of your computer storage. However, it differentiates depending on whether you use Mac or Windows.\u00a0 To check how much free space you have on your Mac, follow these steps: You will see the overall status of your storage. It is divided into categories. Therefore, you can see how much space is used by apps, documents, system data, music, books, podcasts, mail, photos, bin, etc.\u00a0 You will also see how much free space you have left, which is usually marked with white color on the graph. If you want to know more details about each category, simply hover over the specific graph. From here, you can also manage your storage if you click Manage on the right side.\u00a0 There are two ways to check the storage on a Windows computer. You can check the storage status on your computer via Settings or File Explorer.\u00a0 Here you can find out your overall storage, how much space is used, and how much free space you have left. You can also find out the data about different categories such as pictures, music, videos, system, apps, etc. The other way you can find out info about your storage is via File Explorer. Here is how you can do it. 512GB is a lot of storage for an SSD. For most demanding activities and different software, 512GB is sufficient storage, especially if it is an SSD. However, external storage is a better solution if you want to store large files, such as 4K or 8K videos. In this case, you could get an HDD of a larger capacity. This way, you could get more space for less money.\u00a0 It depends on your needs. 512GB is more than enough for an average user who plays a lot of games and stores a lot of movies. But if you are a serious gamer who wants to have more than 20 games on the computer simultaneously, then 1TB is a better choice.\u00a0 It depends on the type of files you want to store. For instance, you could store up to 128,000 compressed 12 MP JPEG photos, 1,000 minutes of 4K 30fps videos, over 132,000 mp3 files, or 24 PC games.\u00a0 Even though a lot of people can find 256GB more than enough for their everyday needs, 512GB is still a better choice. There is a tendency for our files to use more and more storage in the future. Smartphone cameras are getting better, but the pictures and videos simultaneously take up more storage space. For that reason, 512GB is a far better choice at the moment.\u00a0 Is 512GB enough for your needs? Basically, it depends on what you will use the storage for. For most modern software and apps, 512BG is sufficient. Internal storage is a place where you place your operating system and where all the programs are installed. Therefore, it needs to be large enough and fast. If you are a programmer or a gamer, getting a fast SSD and lots of RAM is recommended.\u00a0 If you intend to use a computer for simple everyday tasks, 512GB is more than enough. In this case, you will most likely never encounter a low disc space problem.\u00a0 However, if you intend to store large files, such as high-resolution videos, lots of music, and movies, then you might need more than 512GB. People usually get large capacity HDD external storage for these purposes.\u00a0 Hello, I'm Alex and this is my website, Spacehop.

But one factor contributing to a camera\u2019s quality of capture is often missed in product specifications: the aperture. As a freelance photographer, I believe cameras need less megapixel count and more of the aperture value, sometimes called the f-value, though they are not exactly the same (aperture is measured by the diameter of the lens opening while f-value is the ratio of the focal length to the lens opening\u2019s diameter). That is, if you are not into the printing business. As I have mentioned in a previous article, megapixel only matters when you are printing large copies of your photos. That is so because large printing materials such as tarpaulins, billboards, etc. Read also: Forget about megapixels, your smartphone\u2019s sensor quality is what matters The smartphone camera aperture \u2013 not the sensor size or the thing called MP \u2013 controls much of your photo\u2019s sharpness, exposure, brightness and focus. Here is why. Like digital single lens reflex cameras, many mobile devices currently sprouting in the market as though mushrooms have improved imaging capability due in large part to the introduction of wide-aperture compact lenses. Here are some of the high-end smartphones with wide aperture (rear camera only): Here is a photo taken using Samsung Galaxy S7 (f/1.7) and an iPhone 6S (f/2.2):  For non-photographers, here is a quick guide: the smaller the f-number, the wider the aperture. Otherwise, you see a photo with relatively less focus, brightness and crispness. It means that a camera sensor\u2019s ability to let in more light is dictated by the size of aperture opening. So the wider the aperture, the more light comes in. This is especially helpful in low-lit environments where you need to have as much exposure as you need for a good quality image. If your smartphone does not have a wide aperture, you will get underexposed and/or noisy photos. This can be aided with the use of slower shutter speed or higher ISO, but these settings are mostly used on DSLRs. Though some phones currently have pro modes where you can control the shutter speed and the ISO value, a majority of users don\u2019t touch those settings and capture photos in auto mode only.  The advantage, however, of wide apertures is that you do no longer need to adjust the shutter speed and ISO in low-lit environments, meaning your smartphone camera will be more flexible in different lighting conditions. A slower shutter speed, for example, is not applicable if you are shooting a person, especially a moving person or object. You will need a relatively faster shutter speed to freeze the motion and avoid a blurry capture of your image. Meanwhile, a higher ISO could sometimes lead to noisy images, or images with infinitesimal specks on it. It happens because you are, in effect, stretching the sensor\u2019s light sensitivity to a level where there is no light anymore to detect, therefore resulting in digital aberrations that seem to register light where there is none. As I have made mention above, the f-value is the ratio of the camera\u2019s focal length to the diameter of aperture opening. So the focal length of a camera is another factor to consider when weighing in on the image quality of your smartphone camera. For comparison, I listed below some high-end smartphones along with their equivalent focal length and aperture: From this comparison, we can see that the Samsung Galaxy S8 gathers more light than the rest of the competitors. The size of the aperture opening is also responsible for the depth of field, which results in more or less bokeh: the isolation of the subject from the background. Here is the cheat: the smaller f-value, the more isolated the subject is from the background. In the sample photos above, there is not much difference, though, in terms of isolation because the smartphone cameras used don\u2019t go that far from each other when it comes to aperture. This is because of the crop factor of the image sensor. You can\u2019t really expect much blur in the background using smartphone cameras because the shooter is much smaller in a mobile device than in a DSLR, so all you get is also a small image sensor. Here is the formula: the focal length and f-value multiplied by the crop factor. So the next time you choose which smartphone best suits your taste when it comes to photography, look at the full specs of the device and head directly to the f-value.

That is backwards \u2026 Higher f-number is smaller aperture according to your own chart. Correct?? \nTuan Do says  Feb 26, 2017 at 8:31 pm Thanks a lot for pointing it out. I\u2019ve just fixed it.\nBest \nFact Checker says  Sep 13, 2017 at 9:00 am Why would you fix it if it wasn\u2019t wrong?! 1/1.7 = 0.5882 1/2= 0.5 So yes, the higher the \u2018f-number\u2019, the wider the aperture. This is basic maths, don\u2019t write articles about camera\u2019s if you have trouble with that. \nTuan Do says  Sep 13, 2017 at 11:05 am No, it was me making a mistake. I know this is confusing too. The f-number actually refers to the number, and the ratio describes the size of the aperture. You can check out this guide from Nikon:\n\u201cThe maximum aperture indicates the brightness of the image that the lens creates on the image sensor : lenses with wider maximum apertures (lower minimum f-numbers) create a brighter image on the image sensor than lenses with small maximum apertures (higher minimum f-numbers)\u201d\nhttp://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/basics/19/02.htm \nMridul says  Jan 10, 2021 at 11:44 am Just focus on the digit next to \u201c/\u201d\nThe smaller the better \nIsaac says  Mar 13, 2017 at 11:32 am I get it you prefer Android but to be fair, the Samsung S7 should be compared to the iPhone 7\u2026..not the iPhone 6S. \nJakob says  Apr 2, 2017 at 6:09 am I get it, you prefer iPhone, but\u2026 When demonstrating the effect of aperture, you want to use phones on either end of the aperture scale. \nJADENk says  Apr 21, 2020 at 8:58 pm The iphone 7 has a F/1.8 aperture, while the 6s has a F/2.2 aperture, using the 7 would basically be no different to the S7, so using the 6S gives a bit more insight to the difference between apertures. He could\u2019ve used the 6S and the 7 for the demonstration but he didn\u2019t. Deal with it. I personally think the green on one of the tomatoes looks better on the 6S anyway but at a glance they look very similar besides the fact the 6S shot is more zoomed in. I can\u2019t believe I bothered commenting on this my email is going to be flooded with shid now. \nDeepak says  Jun 18, 2017 at 12:01 pm Does a 2.2 aperature 13mp smartphone is a good option to buy \nwowzers says  Jul 18, 2017 at 12:17 am i hope you didn\u2019t buy that crap yet haha \nAnneel says  Jun 25, 2017 at 2:19 am Good article \nDeepak says  Jul 23, 2017 at 11:27 am Please upload detail with pdf download format \nshrek says  Aug 11, 2017 at 7:45 pm hello, so does the galaxy a5 2017 with 16mp f/1.9 is better photo quality than 13mp f/2,2 of OPPO F3? because of aperture? am i right?\nso why does OPPO is a camera phone? \nzahin says  Aug 31, 2017 at 3:02 am oppo is a camera phone only by name \nUluk says  Sep 3, 2017 at 4:44 am Because it has dual front cameras.

So Oppo F3 is one of best Selfie smartphone. \nImran says  Dec 21, 2017 at 12:13 pm I have to buy one smartphone but confused about front camera as specified in Coolpad cool play having 8 MP+ F2.2 where is Infinix having 16 MP+ F2.0\nI don\u2019t know about these technical terms but I want good picture quality. Please help me to choose right phone in terms of picture quality as I mentioned above!!!! \nit's me says  Jan 9, 2018 at 7:32 pm infinix is better because of higher mp (16) and lower f number (2). The lower the number after \u2018f\u2019, the brighter and sharper the picture so f2.0 is better than f2.2. \nPrincess says  Jan 14, 2018 at 2:21 pm So which one is a better camera phone to buy?\nGalaxy s7 f/1.7 12mp\nOr\nOppo A77 f/2.2 13mp\nPlease help, thanks. \nKogaion says  Jul 1, 2018 at 2:13 pm S7 all the way, in this case. As described in the article, the lower number after the f means more light to the sensor, which is usually better when trying to shoot in low light conditions.\nAs a rule, try to get a camera with a smaller f-number. Megapixels aren\u2019t so important unless you\u2019re going to print extremely large images. \nSandip Mishra says  Jan 21, 2018 at 10:59 am Dear Tuan, your article is very informative. Thanks. Just like me, many people without technical skill buying camera smartphones which many times proved futile. Your article will surely guide us.

The true is: new age camera phones (2020-2021 year) with the large sensor, large megapixel count camera sensor usually come together with larger area, better lens, You\u2019re right about \u201cthe lens is the most important factor\u201d but you\u2019re wrong when you simple just looking at the focal length and f number spec, its wrong, because not always that camera phone with your \u201cbest spec\u201d have the better,bigger lens aperture area than the other. \nPerson in the internets says  Apr 29, 2021 at 11:34 am You missed the only real reason you need a larger aperture in a smartphone. Diffraction. Tiny sensors need large aperture lenses so the tiny pixels can be utilized. Its the combination of pixel size & aperture size that defines how many of those megapixels you can actually utilize. \nJohn says  Jan 13, 2022 at 12:23 pm Which phone is good for a next level camera ? budget 26k below\u2026. please let m know.

How does your phone detect everything from motion, ambient lighting, temperature, humidity, proximity, phone positioning, etc?  All of this is made possible through the help of sensors. In this article, you\u2019ll learn about all the smartphone sensors and what they do. Before we go into details, you might be wondering what a smartphone sensor is. To put it simple, a smartphone sensor is a device installed on a phone that measures physical input in the nearby environment and converts it into data that users can interpret. This list below includes all the standard sensors that are embedded in smartphones.  As its name suggests, the accelerometer measures acceleration. It is with this sensor that your phone is able to detect your steps on pedometer apps and recognizes whether you are moving or not.  Its utilization of its features relies on axis-based motion sensing, which is how your phone recognizes whether it is facing upwards or downwards, as well as whether it\u2019s in landscape or portrait mode.\u00a0 If you have ever turned your phone on its side and your screen rotator feature flipped the image so that it was still right-side-up, you have seen the accelerometer in action.  When the tiny sensors that make up the accelerometer stress due to motion, they respond by interpreting the level of stress to how fast they are moving. It is the accelerometer that allows your GPS app to inform you of how fast you are moving. The gyroscope picks up motion-sensing where the accelerometer leaves off. Gyroscopes are not new. They have been long used in planes to detect altitude (as opposed to lateral motion), but in phones, they are now so common, we likely don\u2019t think much about their presence.  When you play a game that allows you to shift your view or influence your action by simply tilting your phone to the side, you are making use of the gyroscope which interprets your small shifts and turns relative to prior phone positions, even though you are not physically moving in any direction. While the gyroscope mainly operates on the phone\u2019s physical orientation and the accelerometer measures motion, the magnetometer measures the direction and global positioning based on sensing of magnetic fields. The magnetometer, for instance, works in tandem with the GPS sensor to turn the map in a particular direction when you are using the Apple Maps or Google Maps apps.\u00a0 In essence, this sensor is the main reason your phone can pinpoint your location relative to other places, allowing for detailed directions to be provided in navigational apps.  And yes, if you are wondering if this sensor can actually detect the magnetic properties of metals, it most certainly can. It has long been used in metal detectors and is made use of in metal detector apps as well. While the magnetometer assists in the magnetic location aspects, the GPS sensor is the main driver for your phone recognizing your global position.  The GPS pings space satellites without the need to use the phone\u2019s data. If you have ever noticed that your phone is aware of where you are positioned even when you have no signal, that is why.  However, the GPS connectivity is draining to your phone\u2019s battery, as the GPS sensor is perpetually seeking to connect to satellites. This is why turning the GPS off is one of the primary suggestions among battery-saving tips for smartphones.\u00a0 Check this out: 20 Tricks and Tips to Get the Most Out of Google Maps The proximity sensor determines how far objects are from the phone. For instance, a caller using a phone held up to their ear has the screen go dark when the phone is touching their face.  If the object is too close and the screen is on, it can trigger unintended actions to be taken by the user contacting the touchscreen. The proximity sensor determines that a user\u2019s face is close enough to their screen, and proceeds to shut the screen off.\u00a0 If you have ever noticed that the brightness on your phone auto-adjusts based on the lighting of the environment you are in, you have witnessed the ambient light sensor at work.  This sensor detects light around you, then communicates that information back to the phone\u2019s OS, which in turn turns the brightness up or down, depending on the lighting situation. The microphone is a sensor meant specifically for the detection of sound and volume of the sound. As the sound waves trigger the microphone sensor, the phone responds accordingly.  In the most traditional sense, it registers the sound to communicate for phone calls. In other respects, it is also utilized in voice search commands, spoken text dictation, and recognition of incoming sounds for identification, such as the one used by music identifier apps like Shazam. There is a constant flow of electrical currents through the smartphone screen. Touching the screen alters the flow, and the alteration triggers the touchscreen sensors to respond by performing various actions related to the touchpoints applied to the screen.  These current changes dictate the actions on the particular part of the screen at the moment, triggering whatever the requested command is to the device is based on what was touched. Our phones hold many of our most important details, so they are something we try to keep from getting lost from our possession. However, they are also small and therefore can slip from our possession easily or can be simply misplaced.  The concern is that anyone who finds the device will be able to get into it. But the security of smartphones has been enhanced by fingerprint access, meaning only the owner can get in.  Fingerprint sensors take an impression of the lines and ridges of your thumbprint, which is unique only to you. It then measures the distance between the ridges to verify that the user is in fact you.\u00a0 Working in tandem with the accelerometer, the pedometer is predominantly used by fitness apps to count steps. If you have a goal to take 15,000 steps per day, as long as your smartphone is on your person, the pedometer will sense your body movements and count your steps.  Modern pedometer sensors are smart enough to recognize when you are in motion and yet not actually walking.  If you jumped, rode a bike, sat in a moving vehicle, or even ran in place, the pedometer would recognize that you are not actually walking and would not count the steps.  While the accelerometer will also detect steps, the pedometer is a more refined sensor, as step counting is its primary task. If you have been to a restaurant that is actively trying to be \u201cgreen\u201d you have probably been asked to scan a QR code with your phone to retrieve the establishment\u2019s menu.  This is possible due to the barcode and QR code sensor that detects the light reflected by the scanned code, generating an analog signal that represents each bar in a barcode with a different voltage.  The combination of these signals is converted to a digital signal, which is then converted in the unique manifestation of that barcode\u2019s information. Certain stores have customized apps to let you scan barcodes on products to price check them as well as to show detailed information, an important aspect in which this sensor is also a vital component. Certain phones include a barometer, which is a sensor that detects air pressure. These are an important component of weather-related apps, as well as those that inform the user of their current altitude.  Besides atmospheric pressure, a barometer can detect distance from sea level and works with the GPS to figure out the air pressure in your current location. By using optical sensors and LED lighting, the heart rate sensor is able to detect the speed and pattern of your heart rate. Because there is a change in light intensity of the skin when a pulse pounds, the heart rate sensor is able to measure the heart rate by counting the frequency of those light changes. The thermometer sensor exists in nearly every modern smartphone device. It serves two important and particular purposes.  The first is to monitor the temperature of the device itself. If the device gets overheated, the temperature sensor communicates to the phone that it needs to shut down in order to cool off to prevent frying the device.  Secondly, the temperature sensor reads the ambient temperature and can let you know the current temperature, rendering it in Fahrenheit or Celcius, depending on your preferred temperature measurement settings. If you want to take your own temperature, you might need to download one of the best thermometer apps that we recommend. Please check it out. A less common sensor included in modern smartphones is the air humidity sensor which is able to measure the ambient air quality. When it calculates the humidity levels in the air, it relays the information to the user, letting them know of the current air quality. The Geiger counter operates on a sensor that measures marine radiation levels. It has only been released in Japan, however, and as of today, exists built only into the Sharp Pantone 5 device.\u00a0 The Soli sensor is a tiny radar that was introduced by Google on the Pixel 4. Soli allowed you to track your movements on a microscopic scale at high speed and accuracy. Think about you interacting with your phone through hand gestures.  We hope you\u2019ve learned about all the sensors embedded in your smartphone. Without those sensors, your phone wouldn\u2019t be able to performs all these functions.

First, the basics: The \u201cG\u201d stands for generation, meaning 4G is the most current generation of cell phone network coverage and speeds. 3G technology created the first networks fast enough to make smartphones practical. Before that, they were too slow to allow you do all the things that make smartphones great, like streaming videos, surfing the web and downloading music. But it\u2019s 4G that\u2019s really allowed smartphone technology to spread its wings. That\u2019s because it\u2019s much, much faster than 3G. So when you want to download a new game or stream a TV show in HD, you can do it without buffering and lags that make the experience not worth the wait. 4G is pretty much everywhere now, but even if you happen to be in a place that only has 3G, your phone will automatically switch to 3G so you\u2019ll experience no call problems\u2014just slower Internet speeds. LTE stands for Long Term Evolution. It\u2019s a term used for the particular type of 4G that delivers the fastest mobile Internet experience. You\u2019ll usually see it called 4G LTE. Using a 4G smartphone on\u00a0Verizon\u2019s 4G LTE network\u00a0means you can download files from the Internet up to 10 times faster than with 3G. With 4G LTE, using the web from your phone is just like using it from your home computer. For 4G LTE to work, all you need is a smartphone that\u2019s configured to work with it.

In a nutshell it stands for \"fourth-generation\" and the European Commission (EC) says it should be able to download a one-hour movie in six minutes.  But there are no national or international standards for mobile data speeds. 1G, or the first generation of mobile data, was introduced in 1991.  As was 2G, but it was 1G's digital brother. It was analogue and the phones looked a bit like this... Known as an SMS, 2G made it possible to send text messages between friends.  There were also picture messages called MMS (multimedia messaging service) brought in with 2G. And also GSM, GPRS, EDGE on mobile phones like this one.  3G and its 2mbit/s (or 0.25 megabytes per second) data came in at around the time the first wave of smartphones arrived in shops. It's not that fast but it gave wireless access to internet which was the first step - and it made video calling possible. To give you an idea of quite how slow it is as standard, if you wanted David Brent: Life on the Road from iTunes it will supposedly take more than five hours to download the 4.26GB file. And the faster speeds meant that mobile gaming was brought to a whole new level.  The same film that would have taken you more than five hours to download on 3G supposedly takes less than 8 minutes on 4G. But 4G isn't available everywhere yet, some parts of the UK don't even have 2G let alone 3G or 4G.  Well the EC predicts that will be around sometime between 2020 and 2030 and will let you download a one hour HD movie in six seconds.  Who knows what phones will look like then?

As a result, brands are always trying to cram in as many megapixels as possible to lure consumers and photography enthusiasts. Over the past year, we\u2019ve come across phones having 48MP and 64MP cameras. And now, the limelight is on 108MP sensors, seen on phones like Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, Mi 10, and the freshly-unveiled Motorola Edge+. So, what\u2019s the reality behind the 108MP smartphone cameras, and what are their advantages and disadvantages? Let\u2019s have a quick look at the same below. Read on. 50MP vs 108MP vs 12MP | Courtesy: MrWhoseTheBoss You may already know that a camera consists of a sensor that captures light to create photos. These sensors are divided into millions of pixels to capture light individually, making up for each megapixel. So, just like a 12MP camera has 12 million pixels, a 108MP camera\u2019s sensor boasts a whopping 108 million pixels onboard. The 108-megapixel camera\u2019s larger pixel count allows it to capture more information, compared to 64MP, 48MP, and traditional 12MP cameras. Hence, you get a more detailed image that can be zoomed in digitally or printed on a larger scale without becoming blurry or grainy. Now, cramming in more pixels into a camera sensor means the pixels get smaller. And that\u2019s primarily because of limited space for the camera module inside a smartphone\u2019s body, especially when you already have about nine times more pixels than a regular camera. Since each pixel is required to capture light information, the smaller size results in lesser clarity and more color noise in dimly-lit conditions. To tackle this issue, smartphone companies deploy special pixel binning techniques. The main idea behind binning is to combine data from neighboring pixels into one, to enhance the overall image quality. Galaxy S20 Ultra | Credits: Danny Winget The Galaxy S20 Ultra\u2019s primary camera has 108-megapixels laid out in a 1/1.3-inch sensor, with each pixel having a size of 0.8\u00b5m. The Nonacell pixel binning used here combines 9 pixels to 1 make a super-pixel with a resulting size of 2.4\u00b5m. The final picture bears lower 12-megapixel resolution but looks better in reality. In the image given above, you can clearly see the better dynamic range in the binned image. Similarly, the Xiaomi Mi Note 10\u00a0uses Tetracell technology in its 108MP camera to combine four pixels into one, yielding 27MP images with a resultant pixel size of 1.6\u03bcm. The 4-into-1 binning technique is present on almost all 48-megapixel and 64-megapixel camera smartphones. Pixel Binning helps the camera compensate for smaller pixel sizes, especially in low-light. As a result, it gets to deliver brighter and clearer pictures with better clarity, dynamic range, and lesser noise. Though the overall resolution may be compromised, that you won\u2019t mind giving up for the smaller image size. The high-resolution 108MP cameras come with certain positives and negatives. To start with, they let you capture amazing shots in daylight with high levels of details that won\u2019t pixelate on zooming in. And then comes low-light photography, where the software processing has to compensate for smaller pixel size through pixel binning. Note that the high-resolution images often result in slow-processing times and extensively large files. For example, an average 12MP picture would measure about 2-5MB. At the same time, the image clicked at 108MP resolution will give you an approximate size of 20-30MB. That\u2019s why most smartphones with a high megapixel count employ pixel-binning by default to capture lower resolution images. S20 Ultra\u2019s Thin Plane of Focus | Danny Winget That\u2019s not it\u2014the huge sensor size, coupled with a fixed wide aperture, results in a narrower plane of focus. You get a limited area to focus during close-ups, resulting in premature isolation of objects from the background. It may look good in some instances while bad in others, and this can\u2019t be rectified using pixel binning. The use of variable aperture in future phones should mitigate such limitations, though. 108MP cameras aren\u2019t pure gimmicks, counting in the fantastic performance of Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. But it\u2019s important to note that more megapixels don\u2019t necessarily mean better colors, better dynamic range, or better low-light performance. For instance, a Pixel 4 or an iPhone 11 Pro would still be my choice for everyday camera use except for when I want insane zoom or super-high-resolution images. Moreover, most flagship smartphones these days come equipped with telephoto lenses for optical zoom. This rectifies the need for a high-resolution sensor in many scenarios except for when you want to zoom after taking a picture. The Huawei P40 Pro would be an ideal example as the company went with a 50MP sensor, which has by far larger pixels than its 108MP competition. In the end, having more megapixel on offer is indeed useful for attaining extensively high levels of detail. But then again, factors like image processing, sensor size, pixel size, aperture, and more are equally important in deciding image quality.

In this article we will tell you what sensors each Apple Watch has, in addition to explaining what each one consists of. Contents Each Apple Watch has a multitude of sensors that are used for one thing or another. In addition to a microphone, speaker, processing chips or GPS, we highlight those that serve to perform some type of health measurement or help during sports training. Below we explain what all of them consist of, although making it clear that not all of them are present in each generation, as you will see in the following sections.  This sensor basically allows the watch to keep its screen on or off, in addition to varying the brightness depending on the type of light you have at that time. For the latter, this option must be activated in the settings. This is the sensor that receives the movement stimuli. You may have ever wondered how the Apple Watch knows that you are standing, exercising or if you are asleep. Well, precisely this accelerometer is the one who is capable of detecting it. Like the previous one, this also helps to detect the movement of our body, knowing at all times if you are standing or not. Thanks to this, the Apple Watch can more accurately detect the movements of any part of the body even if the device itself is on the wrist. It should be noted that in its latest versions it can even detect falls. In this case we find three versions, the traditional heart rate sensor, the improved one (optical) and the one that also allows for electrocardiograms (electrical). The first two are capable of measuring the beats per minute of the heart and the last one detects electrical activity (Lead I) as long as the app dedicated to it is used and the finger is kept on the digital crown in which it is hosts.  This sensor is capable of detecting the height at which you are, either above sea level or above the ground. Being barometric, it bases its measurements on the relationship between atmospheric pressure and altitude. The homonymous application available in some watches is based precisely on the information obtained by this sensor. It is capable of working even without having WiFi or Mobile Data, since its functionality is to be able to say exactly where the north, south, east and west are. Wow, what has been a traditional compass of a lifetime but on a watch.  The most recent devices of the brand have this sensor in charge of measuring the level of oxygen we have in the blood. It achieves this through a complex internal analysis mechanism that is performed in seconds after comparing data obtained with a beam of red light that is reflected in the veins. Once the different sensors that an Apple watch can incorporate are known, it is necessary to know which of these incorporates each generation. As we have already told you before, not all the sensors mentioned are in all of them, although a good part is.  If you have never had an Apple Watch, it is very likely that you are wondering if it shows when you take a measurement with any of these sensors, if you notice discomfort and even pain. The answer is blunt: no. The way to proceed with the measurements is completely silent, invisible and painless. Maybe you can see a green or red beam of light depending on the measurement, but having the watch in continuous contact with the wrist is hardly noticeable.  In those related to health, just look at the results. If you see that they are strangely anomalous or that they cannot even be carried out accurately, there is a possibility that you do not have the device correctly positioned or you have not followed the instructions for use. However, there is also the possibility that one of these is defective, especially if the watch has suffered a blow. The way to solve it is by going to Apple\u2019s technical service or, failing that, to an authorized one. There they will be able to verify more exactly what is the origin of the problem. If the failure is due to a problem other than misuse and the device is also under warranty, it is very possible that you will receive a replacement without any additional cost.

It\n\nseems to work fine on my D1x and even on my trusty F100. As Julia pointed out, that first flash (called the \"preflash\") is normal: it's how the iTTL flash metering works on your D200. It will not show up in your picture, because it happens before the shutter opens. Only the second flash (called the \"main flash\") will show up in the picture. Is the preflash disturbing your subjects? If it is, there are three workarounds. Do an FEL, as Chad suggested. This produces the most accurate flash exposures. If memory serves, you have to do it before every shot, because the FEL settings \"go away\" in a few seconds when the metering system times out. It sounds like you ran into that, already. Shoot with the flash in it's \"A\" mode. The flash will meter via its onboard sensor, instead of through the camera's metering system, so preflashes are not required. This is easier than FEL, but exposure is less accurate, especially with wide angle or telephoto lenses. Shoot with the flash in \"M\" mode. There is no preflash, but it's very difficult to keep up with changing exposure conditions. \nDetroit Reds Wings - Original Six Hockey with Motown Style!\n\nFifty-two, fifteen, and eight. Watch your back, Dallas! Detroit Pistons - Number 1 in the NBA!\n\nSixty and fourteen, we're gonna stomp some Texan! Ciao! Joe http://www.swissarmyfork.com Change auto meter-off delay (custom setting c3) to \"no limit\" and FV lock will stay activated until it is pressed again to deactivate the setting.  This will wear on your battery life so ensure that you deactivate c3 when you are done shooting or turn off your camera.  That is about as permanent as you can get - any thing further and your risk, with changing conditions, that your flash metering will be inaccurate.

DJI has pared down this offering a bit with their latest sub-250g release, the Mini 3. Is it worth the investment? Above $2500 cameras tend to become increasingly specialized, making it difficult to select a 'best' option. We case our eye over the options costing more than $2500 but less than $4000, to find the best all-rounder.

Enabling this technology reduces the overall size of the system virtual address space and therefore system resource maximums. For more information, see What is 4GT. Limits on physical memory for 32-bit platforms also depend on the Physical Address Extension (PAE), which allows 32-bit Windows systems to use more than 4 GB of physical memory. The following table specifies the limits on memory and address space for supported releases of Windows. Unless otherwise noted, the limits in this table apply to all supported releases. The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows\u00a011. The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows\u00a010. \u00a0 The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows Server\u00a02016. \u00a0 The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows\u00a08. \u00a0 The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows Server\u00a02012. Windows Server\u00a02012 is available only in X64 editions. \u00a0 The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows\u00a07. \u00a0 The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows Server\u00a02008\u00a0R2. Windows Server\u00a02008\u00a0R2 is available only in 64-bit editions. \u00a0 The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows Server\u00a02008. Limits greater than 4 GB for 32-bit Windows assume that PAE is enabled. \u00a0 The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows\u00a0Vista. \u00a0 Windows Home Server is available only in a 32-bit edition. The physical memory limit is 4 GB. The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows Server\u00a02003\u00a0R2. Limits over 4 GB for 32-bit Windows assume that PAE is enabled. \u00a0 The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows Server\u00a02003 with Service Pack\u00a02 (SP2). Limits over 4 GB for 32-bit Windows assume that PAE is enabled. \u00a0 The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows Server\u00a02003 with Service Pack\u00a01 (SP1). Limits over 4 GB for 32-bit Windows assume that PAE is enabled. \u00a0 The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows Server\u00a02003. Limits over 4 GB for 32-bit Windows assume that PAE is enabled. \u00a0 The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows\u00a0XP. \u00a0 The following table specifies the limits on physical memory for Windows Embedded. \u00a0 Devices have to map their memory below 4 GB for compatibility with non-PAE-aware Windows releases. Therefore, if the system has 4GB of RAM, some of it is either disabled or is remapped above 4GB by the BIOS. If the memory is remapped, X64 Windows can use this memory. X86 client versions of Windows don\u2019t support physical memory above the 4GB mark, so they can\u2019t access these remapped regions. Any X64 Windows or X86 Server release can. X86 client versions with PAE enabled do have a usable 37-bit (128 GB) physical address space. The limit that these versions impose is the highest permitted physical RAM address, not the size of the IO space. That means PAE-aware drivers can actually use physical space above 4 GB if they want. For example, drivers could map the \"lost\" memory regions located above 4 GB and expose this memory as a RAM disk. 4-Gigabyte Tuning IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE Physical Address Extension \u00a0 \u00a0"], "https://www.wyzant.com/resources/answers/791717/write-a-linear-function-f-with-the-values-f-2-2-and-f-1-1": [" WYZANT TUTORING Aiden B.

You already know the reasons why you want to avoid using that onboard flash. It washes out your subjects' faces. It creates harsh and ugly shadows behind everything in the scene. It causes red eye. It is, well, ugly. In most cases, it's better to turn up your ISO than to rely on your flash. ISO technology is leaps and bounds ahead of where it used to be, and today even point-and-shoot cameras can provide good, low-grain images at high ISOs.  So now that I've said that, I'll go on to say this: when used correctly and at the right time, flash can provide your photos with interesting and cool effects. So don't exclude it from your bag of tricks altogether.\n You've probably found yourself in a situation where there is plenty of ambient light to take a shot, but not enough ambient light to get a sharp, well exposed image of a moving subject. With the right camera settings, this situation is actually a golden opportunity. You can combine your onboard flash with a slow shutter speed to capture an image with a correctly exposed background, a very cool motion trail and a sharp subject.  You can't just make this happen right out of the box, though; you'll need to take advantage of your camera's rear curtain flash setting.   Most advanced DSLRs have different flash modes. The most basic of these modes is Front Curtain Sync, sometimes just called \"fill flash\". This is the default mode for most cameras, and the one you don't want to use in this situation. Here's why: In this mode, the camera fires the flash at the beginning of the exposure. So if you set your camera up with a slow shutter speed using front curtain flash, what you'll end up with is an image where the motion blur appears in front of the subject instead of behind her. This doesn't look natural - in most cases you'll want the blur to appear behind the subject so that she appears to leave motion trails as she moves forward.\nRear curtain sync, as you might have already guessed, is the opposite of front curtain sync. The shutter opens up first, and the flash fires at the end of the exposure, when the shutter is about to close. Now you get an image where the motion blur appears behind the subject instead of in front of her. Like a front curtain flash image, the subject herself will be sharp, while her movement will be captured in a blur behind her.  Rear curtain flash was used here, because the girl\u2019s image appears at the end of her light trail  This trick works best in low light situations, not in no-light situations. You need ambient light to illuminate the background and/or to capture that motion blur. The more ambient light you have, the more intense that motion trail is going to seem. Without any ambient light you'll get a sharp subject on a black background regardless of how slow your shutter speed is.  A tripod is important when using rear curtain sync. Without one, you'll end up with camera shake as well as motion blur. For the best results, you will also need a camera that can be set to a fully automatic mode. This type of photography - as with many other types of nighttime photography - does require some experimentation, so start with an aperture somewhere in the f/5.6 to f/8 range and a shutter speed of about one second. Take a few shots and see what you come up with. If you think your motion trails are too short, increase your shutter speed - this will produce a longer trail.   Chances are some of your images are just going to look weird - photos taken with this technique don't always produce a perfectly lit/frozen subject. You may end up with a double image of your subject depending on how much ambient light there is and what settings you used. Shoot multiple shots at different settings until you find one that works, then shoot some more until you end up with a great image.  If you find that you like this type of photography, you may want to switch to an external flash. Using an external flash instead of your built-in one will help you adjust the amount of light that reaches your subject. With this technique, washed out faces and black \"halo\" effect shadows can still be a problem, just as they can be a problem for standard photos shot with a direct flash, so it's often helpful to have a flash unit that gives you a little more control.   This trick can make for interesting studio images as well as shots out in the field. Using this technique on a black background can produce some very compelling shots - just make sure that you put your background far enough away from your subject that the flash doesn't reach it. If you're using an external flash you can also experiment with side lighting, which will keep the light from falling on the background. This will produce an image with a strong motion trail and no background to distract the viewer from the effect. In the absence of an external flash you can use all those same tricks for softening flash that you probably already know - for example, use a reflective surface such as a piece of white foam core to bounce the flash in whatever direction you want it to go. At fast shutter speeds, it really doesn't matter if your flash is set up for rear curtain or front curtain sync. Your shutter speed will be fast enough that the difference won't affect your final image. And let's face it, you want to avoid using that onboard flash for all those usual reasons, anyway. So why not just set your camera up for rear curtain and leave it there? That way, you'll be ready for those one-of-a-kind rear curtain flash shots whenever the opportunity arises. See the 21 Outstanding Examples of Rear Curtain Flash article for more examples of rear curtain flash. Most people think this post is Awesome. What do you think? Hi David,\nI get a lot from your articles and I think Johan's print version suggestion is a very good one.\nIt would be handy to print then and have as a reference manual for when you need it.\nI really enjoy the lessons!

It gives me immense pleasure to share the 15th Edition of CSMOP . The new Edition incorporates the Administrative Reforms ushered in the Central Secretariat under the\u201d Initiatives for Increasing Efficiency in Government\u2019 and under the \u201cSpecial Campaign for Disposal of Pending Matters\u201d. The 15th Edition has focused on the 4-pronged approach of Delayering, Delegation, Operationalization of Desk Officer System, Digitization of Central Registration Units and implementation of e-Office Version 7.0 as part of the silent transformation underway in the context of Increasing Efficiency in Decision Making in the Government. Government directions for weekly implementation of the Swachhta Campaign in all Ministries/Departments , and Monthly monitoring/review have been incorporated . The introduction of Nodal Appellate Authorities and revised timelines for grievance redressal also finds mention in the report. For those who are working in the Government and for future entrants, the manual will be an invaluable source of training , guidance and reference. Dated: July 13, 2022 (V. Srinivas) TABLE OF CONTENTS \u00a0 INTRODUCTION CHAPTER- 1 1.1 The prime objective of all public service is to meet the citizens\u2019 needs and to further enhance their welfare. At the same time, those who are accountable for the conduct of that business have to ensure that public resources are managed with utmost care and prudence, as per the laws and the laid down rules & procedures. It is, therefore, necessary in each case to keep appropriate record not only of what has been done but also of why was so done. 1.2 The efficiency of Government to a large extent depends on evolution of adequate processes and procedures and ability of its functionaries to follow them. Accordingly, the efficiency of persons handling information in a Department is judged by their ability to dispose of issues with speed and quality following the procedures prescribed for the purpose. To achieve the twin objectives of efficiency and speed for public good, various Departments of the Government of India over the last decade or so have taken a number of initiatives like introduction of eOffice system. 1.3 The procedures prescribed in this manual attempt to balance the conflicting consideration of speed, quality, transparency and propriety. In a dynamic context, this balance cannot be rigidly or permanently fixed. 1.4 In order to create awareness about these processes and practices especially at the cutting edge level and to sensitize new entrants inducted at various levels in the Central Secretariat, the Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances, as a nodal agency in the field of \u2018Organisation & Methods\u2019, has laid down various procedures for performance of secretariat work by the functionaries in various Ministries/Departments of the Government of India in the form of Central Secretariat Manual of Office Procedure (CSMOP). The First Edition of the Central Secretariat Manual of e-Office Procedure (CSMeOP), brought out in the year 2012, was a step forward towards evolving a paperless environment of decision making process while concurrently achieving speed and accuracy. 1.5 The procedures laid in earlier manuals (relating to physical paper work) have been dovetailed with the new eOffice applications that aim at paperless office. The procedures laid down in this new edition of manual have been adopted for use after careful examination of methods and procedure followed in Ministries/Departments/Offices in Government of India. While doing so the organizational needs of operating functionaries at the initiating level have been the primary concern. The Departments are expected to proactively adapt and to ensure that their teams too switch over to the e-Office. 1.6 First published in March, 1955, CSMOP has been updated from time to time in accordance with the changing scenario. This is the sixteenth revised edition in the series. Newly inducted officials must be trained on the procedures contained in the CSMOP and Refresher Courses should also be organized. 1.7 This Manual also lays down the essential procedures for efficient information and file management i.e. processing, handling and control of official information either on paper or in digital form in the Central Secretariat across Central Ministries and Departments. To provide sufficient flexibility, the Manual suggests the issue of Departmental Instructions which could supplement or vary, within broad limits, the prescribed procedures to suit special conditions and requirements. The various provisions of the Manual which visualize issue of Departmental Instructions are listed in Appendix 1.1. Each Department may devise suitable arrangements, including inspections to ensure compliance of provisions contained in this Manual and Departmental Instructions issued by it.

In 2014 he led his party to victory in elections to the\u00a0Lok Sabha\u00a0(lower chamber of the Indian parliament), after which he was sworn in as\u00a0prime minister\u00a0of\u00a0India. Prior to that he had served (2001\u201314) as chief minister (head of government) of\u00a0Gujarat\u00a0state in western India. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Modi was raised in a small town in northern Gujarat, and he completed an M.A. degree in\u00a0political science\u00a0from Gujarat University in\u00a0Ahmadabad. He joined the pro-Hindu\u00a0Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh\u00a0(RSS) organization in the early 1970s and set up a unit of the RSS\u2019s students\u2019 wing, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, in his area. Modi rose steadily in the RSS\u00a0hierarchy, and his association with the organization significantly benefited his subsequent political career.\u00a0 Modi joined the BJP in 1987, and a year later he was made the general secretary of the Gujarat branch of the party. He was instrumental in greatly strengthening the party\u2019s presence in the state in succeeding years. In 1990 Modi was one of the BJP members who participated in a\u00a0coalition government\u00a0in the state, and he helped the BJP achieve success in the 1995 state legislative assembly elections that in March allowed the party to form the first-ever BJP-controlled government in India. The BJP\u2019s control of the state government was relatively short-lived, however, ending in September 1996. In 1995 Modi was made the secretary of the BJP\u2019s national organization in\u00a0New Delhi, and three years later he was appointed its general secretary. He remained in that office for another three years, but in October 2001 he replaced the incumbent Gujarat chief minister, fellow BJP member\u00a0Keshubhai Patel, after Patel had been held responsible for the state government\u2019s poor response in the aftermath of the massive\u00a0Bhuj earthquake\u00a0in Gujarat earlier that year that killed more than 20,000 people. Modi entered his first-ever electoral contest in a February 2002 by-election that won him a seat in the Gujarat state assembly. After a vigorous campaign\u2014in which Modi portrayed himself as a\u00a0pragmatic\u00a0candidate who could turn around\u00a0India\u2019s\u00a0underperforming economy\u2014he and the party were victorious, with the\u00a0BJP\u00a0winning a clear majority of seats in the chamber. Modi was sworn in as\u00a0prime minister\u00a0on May 26, 2014. Soon after he took office, his government embarked on several reforms, including campaigns to improve India\u2019s transportation\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0and to liberalize rules on direct foreign investment in the\u00a0country. Modi scored two significant diplomatic achievements early in his term. In mid-September he hosted a visit by Chinese President\u00a0Xi Jinping, the first time a Chinese leader had been to India in eight years. At the end of that month, having been granted a U.S. visa, Modi made a highly successful visit to\u00a0New York City, which included a meeting with U.S. Pres.\u00a0Barack Obama. \u00a0 \u00a0 Modi\u2019s policies backfired in 2021. Protests escalated (culminating in the storming of the\u00a0Red Fort\u00a0in January), and extraordinary restrictions and crackdowns by the government failed to suppress them. Meanwhile, despite the remarkably low spread of COVID-19 in January and February, by late April a rapid surge of cases caused by the new\u00a0Delta variant\u00a0had overwhelmed the country\u2019s health care system. Modi, who had held massive political rallies ahead of state elections in March and April, was criticized for neglecting the surge. The BJP ultimately lost the election in a key battleground state despite heavy campaigning. In November, as protests continued and another set of state elections approached, Modi announced that the government would\u00a0repeal\u00a0the agricultural reforms. wow \n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n"], "https://pigtou.com/512-gb-or-1-tb-ssd/": [" It\u2019s no news that SSD is now the more preferred storage medium, offering several amazing features over the regular Hard Disk Drive. However, when it comes to getting a new laptop or upgrading your current one, the question of how much storage is needed comes into play. Besides figuring out features like GPU, or the RAM, storage space is another essential feature you need to get right. Without laying it on thick, a proper storage space plays an essential role in optimizing your system. What you get will certainly depend on budget, model, purpose, what needs to be stored, etc. For the average Joe who only stores text files and a couple of songs, getting a 512 GB or a 1 TB storage space might be going overboard. However, larger storage space is needed for storage-intensive activities like gaming or programming. In this article, we will go into detail on how to choose the right storage space for you. There are various reasons why you might want to expand your system\u2019s storage space. Depending on what you do and how much you love storing things like high-resolution movies, space requirements vary. If all you do is a couple of paperwork and surf the net, you probably don\u2019t need a storage space of 1TB. However, if you are a gamer with many AAA games installed, each close to or over 100GB, getting a 512 GB SSD or higher would be the wisest choice. Our angle of approach in this article will focus on storage space needs based on the activities of gamers, programmers, and graphic designers. Regular games do not take that much space, a little over 1 GB at most. However, if you are one with a taste for the big leagues, you can confirm these games eat up storage space. Blockbuster games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare or Destiny 2: Shadowkeep can easily take more than 100 GB when regular updates and other files are factored in. If you only like having one of these games on your system at once, you can probably do with a 512 GB SSD storage space. For the lovers of multiple games, however, this just might not do. Most gamers tend to switch between various games multiple times per day. This will require a lot more space, and a 1 TB storage space is ideal as the baseline in this scenario. Factoring in about 100 \u2013 200 GB for your OS and other non-game files, a 512 GB SSD is not ideal for most gamers. A baseline of 1 TB SSD will give a lot of wiggle room, especially for heavy games. Using an SSD in place of an HDD also plays a significant role in the gaming experience. You would see many improvements in loading, installation, and update times using the former. While you can easily code on most laptops, not all are well suited for this purpose. Before purchasing a laptop for programming, you must consider features like Display, RAM, Mobility, and CPU. Furthermore, the storage space of a system plays an essential role in programming. Having sufficient storage space coupled with the ideal RAM and GPU will eliminate any form of lagging and occasional crashes that occur while coding. Getting an SSD is the recommended choice. However, the question remains, which is ideal, 512 GB SSD or 1 TB? The answer depends on how much you are willing to exchange for a smoother programming experience. If you are tight on budget, a 256 GB SSD will probably serve you well. However, a 512 GB SSD is an ideal benchmark for any programmer. With time you can upgrade to 1 TB for a smoother experience. The type of programming you do also determines how much storage space you\u2019d need. For instance, a video-game programmer needs at least 1 TB storage space, while a web developer can do with 512 GB SSD. Note that these storage spaces do not factor in the space OS and other system applications. With simple tools like paint or instant artist, you can make pretty cool designs. These applications do not require an intense amount of space. However, enough storage space is required when it comes to big players like Adobe Photoshop or CorelDraw. When you start experiencing lags while using specific graphic applications, it might indicate you need to upgrade your storage space. Graphic designers need a 512 GB SSD storage space to work effectively. Designers tend to combine multiple tools on a project. For instance, you might create vector icons on Adobe Illustrator and complete the whole design in photoshop. This means you will need more space to accommodate all these applications. As it stands, most storage spaces are non-expandable. You cannot add more space to your 256 GB SSD for an upgrade. So, what do you do when you require much more space on your PC than you have?\u00a0 Your best shot is to purchase a new SSD with your preferred storage space. Switching from an old to a new drive involves some technicalities. You should consider giving it to a technician.\u00a0 However, here are a few easy steps you can follow yourself. Voila, you can then enjoy the relative ease your new disk drive brings. A Solid State Drive (SSD) is regarded as a proper upgrade to Hard Disk Drive (HDD) as it has better capabilities than the latter. You get to enjoy faster operation with no noise with the SSD. It, however, costs more. On average, most HDDs have about 3 \u2013 5 years. On the other hand, SSD can last more than five years, and their lifespan depends on how well they are handled. Many factors contribute to how fast your system runs. If you discover your system is running at a much slower rate, this might be due to little or no space left on your drive. However, other factors like a virus, low RAM, or overheating can also cause this.\u00a0   "], "https://www.data-alliance.net/blog/5g-4g-3g-standards-lte-gsm-cdma-ism-wcdma-hspa/": [" \n \n \nLTE (4G), GSM (3G & 2G), CDMA (3G & 2G), 5G and ISM. The fundamental differences between these four modern technologies is the way they transmit and receive information. \nLTE (Long Term Evolution) is a 4G communication standard designed to be 10x faster than standard 3G. the technology provides IP-Based communication of voice and multimedia and streaming at between 100 Mbit per sec and 1 Gbit per second. LTE has an algorithm that is able to send large chunks of data via IP. This approach streamlines the traffic and reduces latency. \r\n\tGSM is an abbreviation for Global System for Mobile Communication. GSM is a digital cellular technology used to transmit data and voice communication at a frequency range of 850MHz to 1900MHz.\u00a0\r\n\tGSM technology uses a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technique to transmit data. The GSM system converts the data into a digital signal and sends it through two different time stamped channels at a rate between 64 kbps and 120 kbps. \nCDMA stands for Code Division Multiple Access. CDMA uses a multiple access mode of communication. This is where several transmissions are made over the same channel simultaneously. Using a speed spectrum, each transmission is assigned a unique code that corresponds to the source and destination of the signal. \nISM: Industrial, scientific and medical radio bands reserved for medical, scientific and industrial use and not intended for telecommunication. Originally this band of radio frequencies was intended for use in industrial, scientific and medical ISM machines that operate at this range in order not to interfere with the wider. \r\n\t5G promises to boost cellular data transfer to speeds rivaling the fastest fiber optic networks. In general, 5G offers better broadband bandwidth, capacity and reliability to levels far beyond 4G. \r\n\t5G which stands for 5th-generation wireless systems consists of improved 5th generation cellular networks deployed in 2018 and beyond. The networks use 4G or new specified 5G frequency bands to operate. \r\n\tThe primary technologies behind 5G include 26, 28, 38 & 60GHz millimeter wave bands. These 5G \tfrequency bands offer speeds as high as 20Gbps.

Please click here to learn how.  Over one hundred years ago on September 1889, Sundar Singh was born in Rampur, in the region of Patiala northern India. He was raised in the luxury of his family's wealth. As a Sikh, Sundar was taught about Hinduism and came along with his parents to Hindu temples. By the age of seven he had already memorized Bagawadgita, the songs of blissful people, which is a long and intricate verse containing lessons of life. At sixteen, not only had he mastered Veda, the ancient sacred books of Hinduism, but he had also read Koran, the sacred book of Islam. He then got acquainted with some Sadhus who taught him Yoga. A Sadhu is a Hindu who devotes his entire life to his religion and forsakes all the worldly pleasures. Sundar remained single and jobless. He travelled all over India wearing a yellow robe without any food and without having any permanent residence. He lived only on the charity of others. It was his mother who first encouraged him to become a Sadhu. She once told him, \"Do not be selfish and materialistic like your brothers, but seek for your peace of mind and hold steadily onto your faith. Be a Sadhu.\" However, he never achieved peacefulness in his meditations. Owing to his mother's connections with some women from a British mission in Rajpur, Sundar was able to enter the school run by the missionaries. It was there that Sundar was first exposed to the Bible. He wasn't interested in the Bible at that time. Instead, he ardently buried himself in the occult art of Hinduism. His mother died when he was 14 years old. Since then his life changed dramatically. Convinced that what Jesus had taught was completely wrong, he tore the Bible apart and burned it. He even threw stones at preachers and encouraged others to do likewise. Still, however hard he tried, he couldn't find the peace he had been seeking for in his own religion. He reached a point in his life where committing suicide crossed his mind. Three days after he burned the Bible in front of his father, he woke up at 3 a.m. and said to himself, \"Oh God, if you do exist, show me the right way, or I will kill myself.\" He was thinking of throwing himself in front of a train that usually passed at 5 a.m. every morning behind their house in the hope that he would find peacefulness in his future reincarnation. He repeated his prayer once again. All of a sudden he saw a brilliant light. At first he feared that the room was on fire. But nothing happened. He then thought that it might be an answer to his prayer. While watching the light, he suddenly saw Jesus' figure in the radiance. He then heard a voice in Hindi saying, \"How much longer are you going to search for me? I have come to save you. You prayed for the right path. Why have you not followed it?\" At that time, Sundar realized that Jesus had not died and that He was alive. Sundar fell on his knees before Him and experienced an astonishing peacefulness which he had never felt before. The vision disappeared, but peace and joy lingered within him. Thereafter his life was transformed. He wanted to be baptized. Although his family tried to prevent him from his intention, he was determined. In 1905, on his birthday, he was baptized in an English church in Simla. At that time, he decided to become a Sadhu Christian, so that he could dedicate himself to the Lord. As a Sadhu, he wore a yellow robe, lived on the charity of others, abandoned all possession and maintained celibacy. He was convinced that this was the best way to introduce the Gospel to his people since it was the only way which his people were accustomed to. In addition, he also wanted to be free to devote himself to the Lord. Having become a Christian, he was renounced by his father and ostracized by his family. On October 16 1905, Sundar wearing a yellow robe, barefooted and without provisions, resumed his nomadic life from village to village, but this time he followed in Jesus' footsteps. In 1906, he went to Tibet for the first time. That country attracted him, primarily because of the great challenges it presented against evangelism. \"There will be very strong opposition and persecution there. High above the tranquil snowclad Himalayan peaks, there will be a lot of time and opportunities to meet God and to read the Bible,\" he thought. On his way to Tibet, he met Stoker, an American missionary who also wore a yellow robe. Sometimes they spent the night together under a tree or in a mountain cave at an altitude of 5000 meters above sea level, without enough food. Happily they endured all the hardship for the sake of spreading the Gospel. When Sundar became ill, Stoker got them a place to stay in a house belonging to a European. Inspired by Sundar's faithfulness towards God and sincere love towards other people, the host repented his sins and gave his life to serving the Lord. Following the advice of his friends, Sadhu enrolled himself in St.John School of Theology in Lahore. After studying for two years there, he resumed his travel. An eyewitness reported his experience with Sundar, \"I encountered Sundar Singh as he was walking down a mountain trail to proclaim the Gospel to us. He then sat on top of a tree, wiped the sweat off his face and sang a hymn about the love of Jesus to us. The audience was not impressed by the song. One man came forward from the audience, pulled Sundar down from the tree and knocked him to the ground. Silently, Sundar got to his feet and began praying for these hostile people. He then told us about the love of Jesus who had died to redeem all sinners. Because of that I repented and so did the attacker.\" That was not the only time when Sundar won souls for the Lord by adhering to Jesus' instruction which says, \"Do not take revenge on someone who wrongs you. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, let him slap your left cheek too.\" (Matthew 5:39). One day in Nepal, Sundar was ambushed by four robbers in the middle of a jungle. One of them brandished a sword. Meekly, Sundar bowed his head thinking that his life was about to end. This attitude surprised the perpetrators. Since he was penniless, they took his blanket away from him and let him go. But then, one of the robbers called him back and curiously asked his name. Sundar introduced himself, opened his Bible and started telling him the story of the rich man and Lazarus the poor. The robber said that the end of the rich man's life was unpleasant and asked what would happen to himself. Sundar then told him about the Gospel and God's forgiveness. The robber took Sundar home with him and repented. In 1912 Sundar decided to imitate Jesus' seclusion and fasting for 40 days even though his friends advised him against it. He failed to fast for 40 days because he became weak. However the experience strengthened his spirit. He could thus overcome all doubts, anger and impatience. In the following years, he was often persecuted but he was also miraculously delivered by the Lord. In 1914, Sundar preached in Nepal, a country with a very strong root of Buddhism. In the town of Rasa, he was sentenced to death by a local Lama on the grounds of spreading a foreign religion. He was thrown into a dry well the top of which was then covered and locked from the outside. He was without food and drink, naked inside the well together with corpses of executed murderers. He stayed in the horrible well for 2 days until a stranger came and helped him out of the well. After relocking the well, the stranger left without saying anything. Not long after that, Sundar was recaptured and taken to the Lama. The Lama was very surprised since he had always kept the only key to the well with him. Realizing that Sundar was under the protection of a very powerful God, they became fearful of him and begged him to leave them. In 1918, Sundar visited Madras where thousands of people gathered to listen to him preach. There Sundar focussed his preach on Jesus Christ the redeemer. He testified, \"Jesus' presence always brought astonishing peace to me no matter how bad the situations I was in. Whenever I was in a prison, he was always there for me. He transformed the jail into a heaven and the burdens became blessings. There are many Christians who do not feel His glorious presence as something real. Because for them Jesus only occurs in their minds and not in their hearts. Only when someone surrenders his heart to Jesus can he find Him.\" Sundar often used parables in his preachings. He once said, \"One day after a long journey, I rested in front of a house. Suddenly a sparrow came towards me blown helplessly by a strong wind. From another direction, an eagle dived to catch the panicky sparrow. Threatened from different directions, the sparrow flew into my lap. By choice, it would not normally do that. However, the little bird was seeking for a refuge from a great danger. Likewise, the violent winds of suffering and trouble blow us into the Lord's protective hands.\" Sadhu Sundar Singh journeyed much. He travelled all over India and Ceylon. Between 1918-1919, he visited Malaysia, Japan and China. Between 1920-1922 he went to Western Europe, Australia and Israel. He preached in many cities; Jerusalem, Lima, Berlin and Amsterdam among others. Sundar remained modest despite his fame. His attitude made his father repent. Sundar never thought of himself. He only desired to follow Jesus' example: to repay evil with kindness and to win over his enemies by love. This attitude often caused his enemies to feel ashamed of themselves. Once, he was preaching in a public market when a fanatic from a different religion suddenly punched his right cheek. Calmly, Sundar turned his left cheek towards the assailant. The attacker left. But that night Sundar received a message from the attacker asking for forgiveness. On another occasion, Sundar told some harvesters about the parable of the weeds. They became annoyed and cursed him. One of them threw a stone at Sundar's head. At that instant, the stone thrower was struck by such a painful headache that he had to lie down on the ground. Without hesitations, Sundar took over that man's chore and helped them harvest the crops. They soon became friendly to him and invited him home. Their hearts were then open to the Gospel. The next day after Sundar left, they noticed that their harvest became more abundant. Sundar visited Tibet every summer. In 1929, he visited that country again and was never seen since. Sundar manifested into his life the verse written in Mark 8:35 which says, \"For whoever wants to save his own life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for me and for the Gospel will save it.\"  Join thousands of others to get the FREEDOM POST newsletter for free, sent twice a week from The Christian Post.

Amazon is selling the 512GB foldable for $1,500, a very nice $420 below the official price. That's substantially less than you normally pay for the base model, and matches an offer on Samsung's website. The Galaxy Z Fold 4 is ultimately a refinement of its predecessor, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Samsung has patched up some of the enthusiast phone's remaining weaknesses with better rear cameras, improved battery life and added design polish. This remains the device to get if you want a powerful phone that can double as a tablet, particularly if you like to juggle multiple apps. The catches at this point are the same ones you've seen for past models, and to some degree foldables in general. The Galaxy Z Fold 4 is bulky compared to conventional smartphones, and you'll have to live with quirks like the display crease. The rear cameras won't beat what you get on the S22 Ultra, and the under-display selfie cam is mediocre (if better hidden). If you're an early adopter or are willing to pay for the biggest screen you can get, though, you'd be hard-pressed to find better hardware at this sale price.

He is currently the Member of Parliament (MP) fromVaranasi.Modi was a key strategist for the BJP in the successful 1995 and 1998Gujaratstate election campaigns. He became Chief Minister of Gujarat in October 2001 and served longer in that position than anyone else to date. He led the BJP in the2014 general election, which resulted in an outright majority for the BJP in theLok Sabha(the lower house of the Indian parliament) \u2013 the last time that any party had secured an outright majority in the LokSabha was in 1984.Modi is aHindu Nationalistand a member of theRashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh(RSS).[3][4]He is a controversial figure both within India as well as internationally[5][6][7][8]as his administration has been criticised for failing to act to prevent the2002 Gujarat riots.[8][9]Modi has been praised for his economic policies, which are credited with creating an environment for a high rate of economic growth in Gujarat.[10]However, his administration has also been criticised for failing to make a significant positive impact upon the human development of the state.[11]Early life and educationModi with his mother Heeraben on his 63rd birthday on 17 September 2013.Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to afamily of grocers belonging to thebackwardGhanchi-Teli(oil-presser) community, inVadnagarinMehsana districtof erstwhileBombay State(present-day Gujarat), India.[12][13][14]He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi and his wife, Heeraben.[15]He helped his father sell tea at Vadnagar railway station. As a child and as a teenager, he ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus.[16][17]In 1967, he completed hisschoolingin Vadnagar, where a teacher described him as being an average student, but a keen debater who had an interest in theatre.[16][18]That interest has influenced how he now projects himself in politics.[19]At the age of eight, Modi came in contact with RSS and he began attending its local shakhas where he came in contact with Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known asVakil Saheb, who is known as his political guru and mentor. Inamdar inducted Modi as abalswayamsevak, a junior cadet in RSS. During his morning exercise session at thekeri pitha shakhaof RSS, he also came in contact with Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, leaders of theJan Sanghwho later founded the BJP's Gujarat state unit in 1980.[15][20][21][22][23][24]Modi's parents arranged his marriage as a child, in keeping with the traditions of the Ghanchi caste. He was engaged at the ageof 13 to Jashodaben Chimanlal and the couple were married by the time he was 18. They spent very little time together andwere soon estranged because Modi decided to pursue an itinerant life,[16][25]and reportedly the marriage was never consummated.[26]Modi kept the marriage secret for most of his career only acknowledging the existence of his wife when filing his nomination for a parliamentary seat in the 2014 general elections.[27][28]As per Modi inKishore Makwana's Common Man Narendra Modi, published in 2014, after leaving home at 17, he went toRamakrishna Missionashram inRajkotand then to theBelur MathnearKolkata. Then he went toGuwahatiand later joined another ashram set up bySwami VivekanandainAlmora, in theHimalayanfoothills. Two years after, he returned to Vadnagar and after a brief halt at his house, Modi left again for Ahmedabad, where he lived and worked in a tea stall runby his uncle where he again came in contact with Lakshmanrao Inamdar who was then based at Hedgewar Bhavan, the RSS headquarters in the city.[15][20][21]He then worked in the staff canteen ofGujarat State Road Transport Corporationuntil he became a full\u2013time pracharak (campaigner)[29]of the RSS in 1970.[23]In 1978, Modi graduated with anextramuraldegree through Distance Education inpolitical sciencefromDelhi University.[15][26]In 1983, while remaining as apracharakin the RSS, completed hisMaster's degreein political science from Gujarat University.[18][30]He still continues to visit Belur Math occasionally[31][32]and talks about his reverence for the Ramakrishna Mission.[33]Early political careerModi became a member of the RSS after theIndo-Pakistani War of 1971.[26]After Modi had received some RSS training inNagpur, which was a prerequisite for taking up an official position in theSangh Parivar, he was given charge of Sangh's student wing,Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, in Gujarat. During 1975\u201377, when Prime MinisterIndira Gandhideclared a state ofthe emergency, political opponents were jailed and political organisation including RSS were banned. Modi went underground in Gujaratand to evade arrest was occasionally disguised as aSikh, saint, elderly man etc.and printed and sent booklets against the central government to Delhi. He also organised agitations and covert distribution of the Sangh's pamphlets.[16][26][34][35]He also participated in the movement against the Emergency underJayaprakash Narayan. He was made the general secretary of the Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti and his primary role was to co-ordinate between activists in the state.[15][36]During this period he wrote a book titledSangharsh ma Gujarat(Gujarat's struggle) in Gujarati which chronicles events, anecdotes as well as his personal experiences.[35][37][38]The RSS assigned Modi to the BJP in 1985.[23]WhileShankersinh Vaghelaand Keshubhai Patel were the established names in the Gujarat BJP at that time, Modi rose to prominence after organisingMurli Manohar Joshi's Kanyakumari-SrinagarEkta yatra(Journey for Unity) in 1991.[16]In 1988, Modi was elected as organising secretary of BJP's Gujarat unit,[39]marking his formal entry into mainstream politics.[26]As secretary, his electoral strategy was central to BJP's victory in the 1995 state elections.[23][40][41]In November 1995, Modi was elected National Secretary of BJP and was transferred to New Delhi where he was assigned responsibility for the party's activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.[40][42]Vaghela defected from the BJP after he lost the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, having previously threatened to do so in 1995.[16]Modi was promoted to the post of general secretary"], "https://routemaps.info/lok-kalyan-marg-to-new-delhi-metro/": [""], "https://www.vivo.com/pk/products/param/v23e": [" X80 V23 5G V23e Y22 Y35 Y02s \n\n X80 V23 5G V23e Y22 Y35 Y02s \n\n Sunshine Gold Sunshine Gold Moonlight Shadow Sunshine Coast 128GB = Rs. 64,999256GB = Rs. 69,999 Processor MediaTek G96 \nMore\n\n RAM & ROM 8GB+128GB 8GB+256GB *Actual available RAM is less than 8GB due to the storage of operating system and pre-installed apps. *Actual available ROM is less than 128GB/256GB due to the storage of operating system and pre-installed apps. \nMore\n\n Battery 4050mAh (TYP) \nMore\n\n Fast Charging 44W (11V/4A) *V23e is equipped with vivo standard charger (FlashCharge adapter 11V / 4A), and supports up to 44W.

I understand when to use rear sync flash where the flash fires just before the shutter closes it allows more ambient light to contribute to the image by using a slower shutter speed than 1/60th sec, and it will show some blur if any movement occurs in the pic. Slow sync is similar (allows more ambient light in the image) but the flash goes off when the shutter opens like front sync mode. Why would anyone use is slow sync mode ie., when would one use it?\n\nRear sync seems to give a nicer effect You would use Slow Sync to let camera A mode actually meter the weak ambient, and then to use that metered shutter speed appropriate for the dim ambient, which is likely lower than 1/60 second minimum if in the dim places where you would need flash. Comes about this way: Generally, default flash mode on the Nikons limits minimum shutter speed to 1/60 second when in dim light.  That is, in a dim room where you need flash, when using automation like camera A mode (aperture preferred), the shutter speed will not go slower 1/60 second.   It stops and hangs there at 1/60 second.  Because, if you are using flash, you do not need it to go below 1/60 second.  This is seen by turning your flash off and metering the dim room, and seeing maybe 1/2 second,  then turn flash on, and see shutter speed jump up to the 1/60 second minimum shutter speed.  Slow Sync allows you to use the first shutter speed with flash. Many camera models have a menu called Flash Shutter Speed (e2 on a D300, e1 on a D90) which will set some other default minimum shutter speed, but never faster than 1/60 second.   However, ambient light brighter than 1/60 will certainly go faster (like outdoors in sun, etc).  The 1/60 is a minimum shutter speed. What Slow Sync mode does is that it will ignore this menu about minimum speed, and the shutter speed will be whatever camera A mode meters it to be... maybe say 1/4 second in a dim room.  Slower than 1/60 second is allowed.  Ignoring the minimum shutter speed is all that Slow Sync does.  Said another way, it allows slower shutter speeds. Technically, Rear Curtain sync only fires the flash at the end of the shutter duration.  Nothing more than that. However, Nikon typically enables Slow Sync with Rear Sync (LCD says REAR SLOW then), cannot set Rear without getting Slow too.  This Slow Sync is what allows the slow shutter speed.  Because Rear Sync only has meaning and use with a slow shutter speed (to show the blur that will follow the action).  If the shutter speed were say 1/100 second, you could not tell the difference with Rear Sync. Many people simply use camera M mode for indoor flash, so they can simply set any shutter speed they wish.   Flash is not affected by shutter speed, so the shutter speed only affects the ambient light.  TTL flash is still fully automatic even with camera M mode.  Camera M  mode is only about what do you set the shutter speed to (that is, aperture is exactly the same as you would set in camera A mode). Affordable ultra-wide lenses for Fujifilm GFX cameras are hard to find. How does the Venus Optics Laowa 19mm F2.8 Zero-D GFX perform? We tested it. The third Great Joy 1.8x anamorphic lens actually covers a full frame sensor, so becomes useful to stills as well as video photographers, and it nicely complements the existing focal lengths to make the beginnings of a good, low-cost, anamorphic set.

He has been in the post since 2014. Prior to this, he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat for 13 years. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Modi started his career by working as a tea seller. He led the BJP to win the absolute majority at the 2014 general elections. Well, how well do you know about Narendra Modi? If not much, here is what we know about Narendra Modi to date. Table of Contents Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 in Vadnagar, Bombay State(now, Gujrat), India. He was born to Hiraben Modi and Damodardas Mulchand Modi. Modi has five siblings and belongs to the Other Backward Class category. He used to help his father by selling in a railway station in Vadnagar. So, how old is Narendra Modi in 2022 and what is his height and weight? Well, Narendra Modi\u2019s age is 72 years old as of today\u2019s date 21st December 2022 having been born on 17 September 1950. Though, he is 5\u2032 7\u2033 in feet and inches and 170 cm in Centimetres tall, he weighs about 165lbs in Pound and 75 kg in Kilograms. When he was only 8 years old, Modi started attending the local training sessions of the RSS. He completed his higher secondary education in 1967 in Vadnagar. Following this, he wandered across many states. He was also jailed for a short period at the Tihar Jail. He has earned his BA degree in political science from the University of Delhi\u2019s School of Open Learning. In 1983, he completed his MA in political science as a distance learning student from Gujarat University. At just 13 years old Narendra Modi got engaged to Jashodaben Chimanla.

Modi acknowledged Jashodaben as his wife while filing his nomination for the 2014 Varanasi constituency. He does not have any children. Narendra Modi is a vegetarian and maintains a close relationship with his mother. He is also a teetotaler, and many people describe him as charismatic and energetic. By following hardline Hindutva\u2019s philosophy, his government has drawn criticism. Media also calls him the poster boy of the Bhartiya Janata Party. He is known for his amazing oratory skills. The Prime Minister of India is one such person who always dedicated himself to his work. Despite being married, he became a wanderer at a very young age. Even though he does not have any children, to call him gay will be unfair. His sexual orientation is very much straight. The Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti appointed Narendra Modi as the general secretary during the time of Emergency. When the RSS was banned, he was forced to go underground. At this time, he authored a book about the events of the Emergency. In 1978, he was the regional organizer of the RSS. At the 1987 Ahmedabad municipal election, he organized the campaign of the BJP. This made him the organizing secretary of the BJP in Gujarat. In 1990, he was named to the national election committee of the party.

He remained the CM of Gujarat until 2014. In September 2013, he was named as the prime ministerial candidate by the BJP. Narendra Modi contested from Vadodara and Varanasi constituency and emerged victorious from both the seats. His leadership made the BJP win 282 seats. In doing so, he became the second Prime Minister of the Bharatiya Janata Party. At the 2019 general elections, the BJP won 303 seats, and Modi again became the PM for the second time. During his tenure as the Prime Minister, he has made many reforms. He came up with the Swachh Bharat Mission for providing hygiene and sanitation. Modi demonetized the 500 and 1000 rupees note to prevent corruption. His government also made the state of Jammu and Kashmir to become a union territory. Narendra Modi has been conferred with many recognitions. In 2020, the United States presented him with the Legion of Merit. He has received the Order of St Andrew from Russia in 2019. Saudi Arabia conferred him with the Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud in 2016. The Indian Prime minister has also received the Seoul Peace Prize in 2018. He has won the Champions of the Earth Award by the United Nations. Modi has also received recognitions from many other countries including Maldives, Palestine, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. In 2014, he appeared on the list of the \u201cMost Powerful Person in the World\u201d by Forbes magazine. As of 2022, The approximate net worth of Narendra Modi is $200 thousand. Even though he is the Prime Minister of India, he has always maintained a simple life. His only source of income is his salary as a member of parliament. Narendra Modi does not have any additional source of income. However, he has written many books, including Social Harmony and Abode of Love. There are also reports that Narendra Modi pays his cook from his own salary. He has a monthly salary of $2,132. He also receives other emoluments as the Prime Minister of India.

In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from School of Open Learning at University of Delhi, graduating with a third class. Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of Surat and Vadodara. Five years later, in 1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University, as an external distance learning student. Modi was sworn in as Chief Minister on 7 October 2001. On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people. Modi's cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved. On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term. In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \" for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014. Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister. Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014. Modi abolished the Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog. In October 2014, the Modi's government deregulated diesel prices. He started a monthly radio programme titled \"Mann Ki Baat\" on 3 October 2014. The economic policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, based on a neoliberal framework. Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other proposed reforms included making it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them; some of these proposals were dropped after protests. The reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. Modi launched Ujjwala scheme to provide free LPG connection to rural households. The scheme led to an increase in LPG consumption by 56% in 2019 as compared to 2014. In 2019, a law was passed to provide 10% reservation to Economically weaker sections. Modi's government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017. He was again sworn in as Prime minister on 30 May 2019.

He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Modi, a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is a Hindu nationalist and member of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).Narendra ModiMP14th Prime Minister of IndiaIncumbentAssumed office26 May 2014PresidentPranab MukherjeeRam Nath KovindPreceded byManmohan Singh14th Chief Minister of GujaratIn office7 October 2001 \u2013 22 May 2014GovernorSunder Singh BhandariKailashpati MishraBalram JakharNawal Kishore SharmaS.

He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. He left home after graduating from school, partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected. Modi travelled around India for two years and visited a number of religious centres. He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[a]or otherwise criticised for its handling of it, however a Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings.[b]His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise.[8]His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education indices in the state.[c]Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election, which gave the party a majority in the Lok Sabha, the first time a single party had achieved this since 1984. Modi himself was elected to parliament from Varanasi. Since taking office, Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, increased spending on infrastructure, and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy, and centralised power by abolishing the planning commission and replacing it with the NITI Aayog. He has begun a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Credited with engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.[d]Early life and educationNarendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c.1915 \u2013 1989) and Hiraben Modi (born c.1920).[17]Modi's family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community,[18][19][20]which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government.[21][22]As a child, Modi helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station and later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus.[23][24]Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, with interest in theatre.[25]Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and his teachers and students noted this.[26]Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.[27][28]When eight years old, Modi discovered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) for RSS and became his political mentor.[29]While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sanghleaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980.[30]Engaged while still a child to Jashodaben, a girl from a family who lived close by, Modi rejected the arranged marriage at the same time he graduated from high school.[31]The resulting familial tensions contributed to his decision to leave home in 1967.[32]Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he went have emerged.[33]In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almoraand the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education.[34][35][36]Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi's life.[37]In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which Modi wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati.[38]Modi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968\u201369.[39]Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad.[40]There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.[41][42]In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city.[43][44][45]After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS,[42]working under Inamdar.[46]Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him.[46]Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001.[47]In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Artsdegree in political science from School of Open Learning[48]at University of Delhi,[49][50]graduating with a third class.[51]Five years later, in 1983, he received a Master of Artsdegree in political science from Gujarat University,[52][53]as an external distance learning student.[54]Early political careerIn June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhideclared a state of emergency in India which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as \"The Emergency\", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.[55][56]Modi was appointed general secretary of the \"Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\", an RSS committee coordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.[57]Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.[58][59]Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.[60]During this period, Modi wrote a book in Gujarati, Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In The Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency.[61][62]Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes, as well as several other national political figures.[63]In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a Sikh.[60]Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak(regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency.[64]He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985.[30]In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers.[65]After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.[66]Modi rose within the party and was named a member of the BJP's National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise L. K. Advani's 1990 Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991\u201392 Ekta Yatra(Journey for Unity).[25][67][68]However, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in Ahmedabad; friction with Shankersingh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played a part in this decision.[68]Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani, and as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly elections.[68][30][69][70]In November of that year Modi was elected BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.[69][71]The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections.[25]Modi, on the selection committee for the 1998 Assembly elections in Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as key to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections,[69][72]and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year.[73]Chief Minister of GujaratTaking officeIn 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.[69][74][75]The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement.[25]Although BJP leader L. K. Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was \"going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all\". On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections.[76]On 7 October 2001, Modi was administered the oath of office.[77]On 24 February 2002 he entered the Gujarat state legislature by winning a by-election to the Rajkot \u2013 II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC by 14,728 votes, which enabled him to take office.[78]2002 Gujarat riotsMain article: 2002 Gujarat riotsOn 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[e]The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[81][82]In making a public statement after the incident, Modi said that the attack had been terror attack planned by local Muslims.[3][81][83]The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh across the state.[84][85]Riots began during the bandh, and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.[81][84][85]The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.[81][86]The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed.[87]Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000.[81][88]Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.[89]Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women.[2]The government of Gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots,[1][2][3]and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation.[90]Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom, while others have called it an example of state terrorism.[91][92][93]Summarising academic views on the subject, Martha Nussbaum said: \"There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law.\"[2]The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating.[84][85]The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh, despite such actions being illegal at the time.[3]State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.[94]Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.[95]During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.[2][83][96]In 2012 Maya Kodnani, a minister in Modi's government from 2007 to 2009, was convicted by a lower court for participation in the Naroda Patiya massacre during the 2002 riots.[97][98]Although Modi's government had announced that it would seek the death penalty for Kodnani on appeal, it reversed its decision in 2013.[99][100]On 21 April 2018, the Gujarat High Court acquitted Kodnani while noting that there were several shortfalls in the investigation.[101]Modi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, Modi said that \"What is happening is a chain of action and reaction.\"[2]Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.[102]Modi has not offered an apology for the riots and has stated that he should be rather punished and not forgiven if he is guilty.[11][103]In March 2008, the Supreme Court reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.[90][104][105]In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri (widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre), in April 2009 the court also asked the SIT to investigate the issue of Modi's complicity in the killings.[104]The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.[104][106]In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT's position, he said that Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.[107][108]The Supreme Court gave the matter to the magistrate's court. The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jaffri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013 the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister.[109]2002 electionIn the aftermath of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.[110]Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted.[111]His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved.[112][113]Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002.[114]In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.[115]Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign,[116][117][118][119]and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters.[114]He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 1,13,589 of 1,54,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes.[120]On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term.[121]Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly.[1][116]Second termDuring Modi's second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development.[74][1][116]Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivarorganisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad(VHP),[122]entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry,[74]and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP.[122][123]Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions.[122]Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a foreword to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.[124][125]Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister)[126][127]distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.[128][129]Questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed under the aegis of the International Religious Freedom Act,[130][131]the only person denied a US visa under this law.[132]The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[133]and the EU[134]lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington.[135][136]During the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism.[137]In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \" for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings.[138]In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a \"spiritual experience\" for Valmiks, a sub-caste of Dalits.[139][140]However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct.[141]After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat's 1,600-kilometre (990 mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats.[142]In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post,[143]and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election.[144]Development projectsThe Sardar Sarovar Dam during a 2006 height increase.As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth \u20b96.6 trillion were signed.[74]The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them.[145]Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.[146]As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cottonincreased to become the largest in India.[145]The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use[147]led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007.[148]Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4\u20136% of the area intended.[145]Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent \u2013 the highest of any state.[147]However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992\u201397 INC government was 12.9 percent.[149]In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata's to Gujarat.[150]The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed.[149]Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised,[145]according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.[151]Development debateModi addressing graduates of the Gujarat National Law University in 2012.There has been a contentious debate surrounding the development of the state of Gujarat during Modi's tenure as chief minister.[152]The GDP growth rate of Gujarat averaged 10% during Modi's tenure, a value above that of the country as a whole, and similar to other highly industrialised states.[150]Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office.[153]Some scholars have stated the rate of growth did not accelerate during Modi's tenure,[153]although the state is considered to have maintained a high growth rate during Modi's Chief Ministership.[95]Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank's \"ease of doing business\" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years.[154]In 2013, Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for \"economic freedom\" by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states.[150][155]In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.[1]Tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states, as was land. Modi's policies to make Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones, where labour laws were greatly weakened.[116]Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the \"alarming\" category on the India State Hunger Index.[156][157]A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found that Gujarat under Modi had a poor record with respect to immunisation in children.[158]Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.[95]It showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined.[95]With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below most Indian states.[95]The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits, and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities.[95]Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index. Political Scientist Christophe Jaffrelotsays that under Modi the number of families below the poverty line has increased and conditions for rural adivasi and dalits, in particular, have declined.[5]Under Modi, the state government spent far less than the national average on education and healthcare.[95]In July 2013, economics Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen expressed disapproval of Modi's governance record, saying that under his administration Gujarat's \"record in education and healthcare is pretty bad\".[159]However, economists Arvind Panagariya and Jagdish Bhagwati say that Gujarat's social indicators have improved from a lower baseline than that of other Indian states. According to them, Gujarat's performance in raising literacy rates has been superior to other states and the \"rapid\" improvement of health indicators is evidence that \"its progress has not been poor by any means.\"[160]Final yearsModi with Anandiben Patel at a meeting of BJP MLAs after his election as prime minister; Patel succeeded him as Gujarat chief minister.Further information: Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, 2012During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.[116]Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.[116]He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra.[116]His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012.[116]He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji(\"Guru worthy of worship\").[161]According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.[162]While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people,[114]something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt.[163]The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure[164]and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995).[165]In later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates.[166]In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests by Indian-Americans.[167]After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014. Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister.[168] Caution: form this is an advance proof copy of an irs tax form. it is subject to change and omb approval before it is officially released. if you have any comments on this form, you can submit them to us on our web site. include the word in your...

He was awarded the degree in 1979. DU also said that two different roll number's were allotted to Modi in 1977 and 1978 and his name 'Narendra Kumar Damodar Das Mody', which was seen on a marksheet flashed by AAP leader Ashutosh on TV, is nothing but a spelling mistake.  Moments after Amit Shah flashed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BA and MA degrees at a press conference and demanded an apology from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for raking up a false issue, the AAP hit back, claiming that the degrees displayed by the BJP president were fake. \"PM Narendra Modi's degrees shown by Amit Shah and Arun Jaitley are fake and forged,\" senior AAP leader Ashutosh had said as he asked how the two degrees have two different names. \"The BA degree {shown below} has Narendra Kumar Damodardas Modi while the MA degree says his name is Narendra Damodardas Modi,\" he said.  Accusing Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of turning a \"blatant lie into truth\", BJP chief Amit Shah today displayed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's degrees as his party tried to clear the air around the Prime Minister's educational qualifications. \"We are putting both the degrees of the Prime Minister, the Bachelor of Arts from Delhi University and the MA from Gujarat University in public domain,\" Shah told in a press conference he addressed with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.  The BJP on today made public the BA and MA degrees of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and sought an apology from Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for accusing Modi of lying about his educational qualification.  Meanwhile, BJP MLA from Delhi's Babarpur constituency Naresh Gaur on Monday vouched that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stayed with him in 1974 when he came to Delhi to appear for his B.A. first year exams at Delhi University (DU). \"Modi ji stayed with me at the ABVP office at 33, Bungalow Road when he came to appear for his first year B.A. exams. He was an ordinary party worker back then,\" Gaur, a three-time legislator from Babarpur constituency in north-east Delhi, said. However, Gaur said it was the only time that he saw Modi appearing for Delhi University exams. \"In 1975, during the Emergency we were arrested and stayed in jail for close to 10 months. I don't know what happened after that,\" Gaur said. He was speaking on the sidelines of the press conference held here by BJP chief Amit Shah and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Modi's educational qualifications. But, said Gaur, he was \"sure\" that Modi's degree from DU was real. \"I am one thousand percent sure that Modi's degree is real and not fake,\" he said. Gaur said that there were spare rooms at the office where party workers from outside Delhi could briefly stay, and that he himself stayed all the time at the office as a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) pracharak. Bungalow Road is close to Delhi University.

Tribune Photo: Inderjeet Singh \n \n\n\n Vikram Sharma Tribune News Service Jammu, July 31 Gurdwara Sunder Singh, the oldest gurdwara in Jammu, holds significance for being the nerve centre for people escaping various conflict zones and seeking asylum. The gurdwara, built on January 22, 1842, was a concerted effort of a trust constituted under the name of a Sufi saint Baba Sunder Singh of Ali Beigh, now in Pakistan, and is revered to be the oldest seat of obeisance for the Sikh community. \u201cBaba Sunder Singh Trust was formed in 1800 and an inn came into existence around 1825 where people used to take sojourns during their journey. Later, a gurdwara was built adjacent to the inn in 1842,\u201d said Surdershan Singh Wazir, ex-president, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, Jammu. Being a heritage site and adjacent to Raghunath Temple, Jammu, the gurdwara holds another significance for being a shelter provider to the people escaping from different conflict zones in Jammu during the Maharaja period under the British regime. Presently under repair as its lintel caved-in a few months back, the heritage symbol of Jammu is being taken full care of to uphold its pristine craftsmanship. The road on which the gurdwara is situated was later named as Sunder Singh road. \u201cOnly the lintel is being repaired and complete care is being taken not to damage any part of the gurdwara that houses nearly 20 rooms which serve as an inn,\u201d said Joginder Singh, head priest at Gurdwara Sunder Singh. Adding to the history of the gurdwara, the head priest said three brothers Uttam Singh, Sohan Singh and Shram Singh who became the trustees of Baba Sunder Singh Trust later gave a fillip to the old gurdwara and expanded its boundary to add a few more rooms to accommodate more people. He said in the pre-partition days, Baba Sunder Singh Gurdwara used to be a home to many people of the region who participated in langar-making and serving food to the pilgrims as well as shelter-seekers. \u201cImmediately after the partition in 1947, the gurdwara played an important part for being a sanctuary to people of all religions who sought refuge in it,\u201d said Joginder Singh. \u2018Om\u2019, \u2018Swastik\u2019 insignias on front door \r\n                    A\r\n                    -\n \r\n                    A\r\n                    +\n \r\n            SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\r\n         Indian govt tells states to conduct genome-sequencing of sam...

But who can really tell till it is announced?  With BJP nominating former Jharkhand Governor Draupadi Murmu as NDA\u2019s Presidential nominee, chances of Naidu to continue as Vice President has brightened. There is no reason for the NDA to risk a new and untested person as VP who is also the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. He has been more than useful as the RS chairman in keeping the opposition quiet in the House.  But unlike the outgoing President Ram Nath Kovind or the NDA\u2019s Presidential nominee Draupadi Murmu, Vice President Naidu\u2019s family runs a business empire, point out his critics within the NDA. The family runs NGOs, Trusts and foundations, which claim they do not receive or even accept any grant from governments. But donations, CSR funds and schemes funded by the government which they execute depend on Naidu being in office, they say. Once he is out of office, the Trusts could come under closer scrutiny, they maintain.  His critics or even his \u2018enemies\u2019 within the BJP have been gleefully waiting for Venkaiah Naidu to retire. The funds to the NGOs would then dry up, they hoped, and with some luck, the Income Tax and Enforcement Directorate could also come sniffing, given the present government\u2019s perceived allergy to Trusts and NGOs. The Naidu family set up the Swarna Bharatha Trust in 2001 and it has grown phenomenally since July 2002, when Naidu first became minister for rural development in the then AB Vajpayee government. What critics question is Naidu\u2019s continued and overt interest in the family NGO. Even as the Vice President he has continued to attend various events and programmes hosted by the family NGO. \u201cOne in three flights he takes out of Delhi lands in Hyderabad and off he goes to attend one event or the other by the NGO,\u201d claimed one of his critics in Hyderabad, alleging a clear conflict of interest. What is the point of boasting that you don\u2019t accept funds from the government when the Vice President of the country regularly attends your events? An impartial inquiry into the CSR funds diverted by other foundations run by different companies which benefitted when Naidu was the Urban Development Minister, and the contracts related to the development of a new capital of Andhra Pradesh at Amravati, they say, would prove their point. There are legitimate businesses too run by the family, which benefit from access to power. A Toyota dealership receiving a contract worth several hundred crores of rupees to supply vehicles to Telangana Government is perfectly above board but wouldn\u2019t come your way unless you can move powerful strings. Founded in 2001 the Swarna Bharatha Trust has three chapters, one in Hyderabad, another one in Vellore and the third one in Vijayawada. The organization has been conducting skill development programme, vocational training and other educational programmes.

The Public Grievance Division is responsible for this activity since December 1987. From 1997, the Division has also been made responsible for Citizen Centric Initiatives, namely, Citizens Charter. PUBLIC GRIEVANCES REDRESSAL MECHANISM  The Public Grievances Division has undertaken various activities during the years, some of which are on-going activities from the previous years, to improve the grievance redressal mechanism and  to provide a citizen centric governance. CENTRAL PUBLIC GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL AND MONITORING SYSTEM (CPGRAMS)    An online system for grievance redress, called the \u2018Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System\u2019 (CPGRAMS) has evolved since 2007. CPGRAMS facilitates forwarding of public grievances received online from the citizens to both the Central Government Ministries/Departments/Organizations as well as the State Governments concerned. The inflow of these Centre and State related grievances are in two forms (i) online registered grievances through CPGRAMS and (ii) offline grievances received through post. The grievances received through post are digitized, uploaded on CPGRAMS and forwarded online through the System to the Central Ministries/Departments/Organizations concerned.  The Appeal Mechanism/functionality in CPGRAMS in compliance to the Recommendation No.38 made by the Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice in its One Hundredth Report on Demand for Grants (2020-21) has been Introduced in CPGRAMS. The Appeal provision has been made for redressal of dis- satisfied grievances identified through a mandatory feedback ratting to be given by the Citizen on disposal of the grievance by the Nodal Grievance Officers\u201d The functionality of Nodal Appellate Authorities nominated in Ministries/Departments was operationalized on 21.01.2021  The CPGRAMS interlinks 86 Central Ministries/Departments/ Organizations and 37 States /UTs. There are more than 51,000 sub-ordinate users listed on it which includes subordinate and field officers also. CPGRAMS Reforms    At present, the Department has undertaken CPGRAMS Reforms in the top grievance receiving Ministries/Departments. The CPGRAMS reforms envisages to ensure user friendly lodging of grievance by a citizen and enables navigation of the grievance to reach the field office responsible for resolution of the same.  CPGRAMS Reforms will streamline grievance redressal mechanism so that the grievances reach the rightful redressal Office, surpassing the line offices.  The broader salient features of the CPGRAMS Reforms version 7.0 are that it is citizen friendly as there is a questionnaire guided registration process.  Besides, there is a provision of lodging a grievance which will be automatically forwarded to field level directly.  The system will also improve grievance redress time and lodging of grievance is done through drop down menus.    The CPGRAMS  Reforms version 7.0 has so far been launched in the Department of Posts on 25th September, 2019 and in  the Departments of Telecommunications and Financial  Services    (Banking & Insurance Division)  on  5th November,  2019  in  the National Workshop on CPGRAMS Reforms  held at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi.  The CPGRAMS Reforms was launched on 12th February,2020 in another 5 Ministries/Departments, namely Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Road, Transport & Highways and Department of School Education & Literacy.    CPGRAMS version 7.0 was has been activated in the Ministry/Department of Civil Aviation, Labour & Employment, Higher Education and Department of Personnel & Training on 09.03.2021. Citizens can also use a Mobile App for lodging of public grievances and the action Status can also be viewed on the mobile itself. This mobile app is integrated with Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance (UMANG). The app is available in both Android and iOS versions. A new mobile app called My Grievance is also available which is independent of CPGRAMS which is available in Android version.

Most often for incorrect reasons. So here is when NOT to use rear-curtain sync flash \u2026 whenever you don\u2019t need it. Sounds confusing? Well, let me explain \u2026 \u00a0 Your camera\u2019s shutter consists of two curtains that open, and allows the light to hit the sensor or film. This is true for all focal plane shutter film cameras, (as opposed to those with leaf shutters), and true for all digital cameras that have a mechanical shutter, (as opposed to an electronic shutter.) To allow light to hit the sensor (or film), the first shutter opens, and then some short time duration later, the second curtain closes. Now, in using slower shutter speeds than max sync speed, most D-SLRS and speedlights allow you two points at which you can sync your flash. You can either have your flash fire right at the point when the first shutter has opened, (first curtain sync), or juuust before the second curtain (rear curtain) closes. This gives two different effects when your subject is moving laterally across your frame. The way the ambient blur records in relation to the flash-frozen moving subjects, looks different for those two ways of syncing your flash. If you\u2019re photographing people (or any subject) in low light, and you use flash .. while that subject is moving, then rear curtain sync will most likely give you the best effect.\u00a0 (More about that in a follow-up article later on.) However, when your subject is static, there really is no difference in how your photograph will appear .. except when you\u2019re using TTL flash, and you\u2019re photographing people looking at the camera. To explain why, let\u2019s look at this diagram again:  \u00a0 \u00a0  In calculating the TTL flash exposure, the camera and speedlight emits a preflash sequence.\u00a0 It is from this pulse / pulses of light BEFORE the main burst of flash gives you proper exposure, that the camera calculates the TTL flash exposure. When you\u2019re using first curtain / normal flash sync, then the time between the preflash and the main burst are so close to each other, that you can\u2019t distinguish the difference.\u00a0 It looks like one burst of light. However, when you\u2019re using rear curtain / second curtain flash sync, then there might be an appreciable interval between the preflash and the main burst.\u00a0 The slower your shutter speed, the greater this delay between the preflash firing and the main burst. When you\u2019re photographing people, then at slower shutter speeds, they DO react to the preflash, and most people will blink in response.\u00a0 The results is that you will have a greater number of photographs where people are blinking or half-blinking.\u00a0 Not attractive. \u00a0 You can actually see this delay in the preflash and main burst: Set your camera to any ISO and aperture.\nSince this is just a test, you can set a high ISO (doesn\u2019t matter how high), and a wide-ish aperture.\u00a0 f4 is good.\nSet your shutter speed to 1 second.\nBounce your flash.\u00a0 (There\u2019s no real reason.\u00a0 Just do it because\u00a0it is a good idea anyway.) Keep your flash to first curtain sync, and trip your shutter while noticing the burst(s) of light.\nIt will look like a single burst of light. Now set your camera or speedlight to rear curtain sync.\n\u2013 with Nikon it is usually a button on the top of your camera that you push, while rotating the dial.\u00a0 The button will have a lightning symbol on it.\n\u2013 with Canon, it is a setting on your speedlight.\u00a0 It is the button with the lightning symbol and triangles.\u00a0 Push the button until you have to the triangles set.\nYou will now see two distinct bursts of light.\u00a0 The first is the preflash with which the camera determines TTL flash exposure.\u00a0 The second is the actual flash burst that gives you the exposure you will see in the photograph. That delay causes the preflash to appear distinct from the main burst of light.\u00a0 This will often cause people to react by blinking. \u00a0 Rear curtain flash will NOT give you better flash exposure than first curtain sync. I\u00a0frequently see advice on the forums that using rear curtain flash sync will give you better flash exposure.\u00a0 This simple is not true. \u00a0 My advice as to when you should use rear curtain sync \u2013 use it when you have a specific reason to.\u00a0 Such as when you want to avoid the ghosting effect you see with movement and you\u2019re using flash.\u00a0 Any other time, just use first curtain sync.\u00a0 You will have far fewer \u2018blinkers\u2019, and your life will be simpler. \u00a0 Filed Under: flash photography, technique Tagged With: first curtain flash sync, flash photography, flash photography technique, flash sync, rear curtain flash sync, second curtain flash sync \u00a0 If you find these articles of value, please help support this website by using these B&H and Amazon affiliate links to order your photo gear.

Thank you, Neil vN   Books by Neil van Niekerk   \u00a0 \n\n\n \n  1Jeff says  \nDecember 14, 2009 at 12:31 pm  another great article Neil.\nI noticed today that not only do you know the topic, but additionally you always have all the technical terms and description correct as well.  Actually remembering the correct terms is a task in itself. Always look forward to your next posting. \n  2Paul Gallagher says  \nDecember 14, 2009 at 3:28 pm  Thanks Neil, another great article. Could you possibly explain about slow sync flash, I was photography a childs christening last weekend and the priest had to rush of after so turned of all the lights in the church, it was a really dark wet miserable day so to get some more ambient light for the group shots I used the slow sync flash, but my  keep rate was poor due to subject movement. I was using a tripod but went back to the normal mode again. \n  3Neil vN says  \nDecember 14, 2009 at 3:35 pm  Aaaah, you were shooting in one of the automatic modes, and used slow-speed sync.  And your camera chose a shutter speed that was too slow for your needs. Well, that\u2019s what you get for not shooting in manual exposure mode, where YOU choose your shutter speed. ; ) \n  4Paul Gallagher says  \nDecember 15, 2009 at 5:49 am  Thanks Neil, I was on manual then changed to A mode for some reason on the slow sync flash\u2026my bad.  That cleared up that problem, thanks.\nPaul \n  5Paul Gallagher says  \nDecember 15, 2009 at 6:00 am  Hi Neil, I just went and tried it in Manual mode there now and remembered why I chose Aperature Priority mode, its because in M mode it won\u2019t select slow sync flash, I was using F4 at 1/20 sec, why do you think this is, oh its a Nikon D300 and SB900 speedlight?\nPaul \n  6Neil vN says  \nDecember 15, 2009 at 7:55 am  Paul, the idea behind slow sync is that originally most cameras would default to maximum flash sync speed when you added a dedicated speedlight.  This would cause a dark background in most low-light situations. So they added a slow-sync feature to enable the camera to get to slow shutter speeds when you shoot in an automatic mode on your camera. This is a moot point though when you\u2019re shooting in manual mode on your camera, since you can select any shutter speed you need.  Besides, in manual exposure mode the shutter speed is fixed, so by definition, slow sync mode can only work in aperture priority or program modes. \n  7Roel says  \nDecember 15, 2009 at 8:44 am  FWIW: I happen to be testing some flash settings lately, based on the Nikon CLS Guide Blog Post 17(see Neil\u2019s blog roll) and found out that the following works for me to a large extent: 1. set camera to Manual mode\n2. set shutter speed to a \u201cnon-blurring\u201d speed \u2013 see further below\n3. set aperture to a \u201cmedium-fast\u201d number \u2013 see further\n4. set/use ISO to control ambient light On the shutter speed: I\u2019d kick in at 1/125, which is enough to handheld for most of the shots and to stop movement in peoples faces and hands \u2013 something you\u2019ll encounter a lot when using slow/rear-curtain sync. I shoots kids quite often and it\u2019s difficult to keep\u2019em still.  If needed, you can drop to 1/60 or even 1/15, but mind that blur is likely to be visible. On the aperture: I set mine to 5.6 for 3 reasons:\n\u2013 5.6 is the slowest aperture for my entire zoomrange. I use the 18-200 VR (on a D300) mainly, which is rather slow.  On the 50/1.8, f5.6 is right in the sweet spot of the lens. Once set, I can forget about it while zooming.\n\u2013 it gives me reasonable and constant DOF throughout the zoomrange\n\u2013 at 5.6 the flash is not stressed that much, allowing for fast recycling On the ISO: I find myself shooting at ISO 800-1600 a LOT using these settings.  Basically, the flash light will *almost* become a fill, rather than the main light and the results are much more pleasing. As you can guess by now: flash is in iTTL-mode, not manual.  iTTL is forgiving for changing distances between camera and subject. Btw, this also works excellent when simply using the built-in flash of any DSLR on the market.  And 5.6 is an aperture often found on consumer lenses\u2026 illustrating that you don\u2019t need top material to drastically improve your images. R. \n  8Paul Gallagher says  \nDecember 15, 2009 at 5:49 pm  Thanks to both of you for clearing that up for me.  I think I am still stuck in the fact that 400ISO is as far as i can push my camera.  The thought behind this is that my camera for years has been a 20d and technology has greatly came on since that with my D300.\nThanks again to you both for your help.\nPaul \n  9Chris Shepard says  \nDecember 16, 2009 at 9:30 pm  Great Stuff! I love your blog, lots of great info! \n  10marcus says  \nDecember 17, 2009 at 6:38 pm  Thanks Neil,\nEarly indications are that switching from rear curtain to first curtain sync, as per your advice in comments on earlier thread, has solved my blinking issue. Great stuff, I usually shoot with manual flash power, but it\u2019s good to know that I can switch to ittl now without getting the problems with blinking, will probably use ittl much more in future. Appreciate your help on this,\nMarcus \n  11Maarten says  \nDecember 18, 2009 at 10:38 am  If you want to avoid people blinking on the preflash: set your flash to manual, then there is no TTL-preflash. \n  12marcus says  \nDecember 18, 2009 at 7:35 pm  @ Maarten, yes, and I\u2019m comfortable doing that, but it\u2019s also good to shoot ittl sometimes, and not have to constantly think about and adjust flash power every time the camera /flash / subject relationship changes. \n  13Steve says  \nDecember 19, 2009 at 9:29 am  Hi all! Are  you really having lots of problems with people blinking? I always shoot with rear-curtain sync and I don\u2019t notice anything out of the ordinary. For example, I assisted on two weddings this past weekend and got maybe half a dozen blinkers. For 1200 images, that\u2019s negligible. Maybe it\u2019s bacause I don\u2019t shoot any slower than 1/25 or so? \n  14Alvin Yap says  \nDecember 20, 2009 at 8:49 am  Hey Neil,\nWhat about using FEL? My experience is that not wedding photography \u2013 just general people shots and wildlife), but my experience is that front or rear sync I will still get some people with blinks, especially with some people that HAVE to blink when the pre-flash goes off. FEL or manual helps in this case. Oh btw, I was shooting my friends at a bowling alley yesterday with your black foamie trick (I used just black cardboard as my flag) \u2013 it is amazing how I could get soft diffused shadows. Thank you very much for sharing your techniques :) Regards,\nAlvin \n  15Aruna says  \nJanuary 1, 2010 at 3:37 pm  I am new to flash photography and I have been experienceing quite a few problems when photographing people (ghosting due to movement), even when I have the camera on a tripod. I had set the e2 setting \u201cflash shutter speed\u201d to 1/60 and when shooting Apeture priority was getting really crappy photos. After reading this article and the comments, now I figured out my problem, not using a \u201cnon-blurry\u201d shutter speed, and to use manual or shutter priorty, depending on the situation. Still I got lots to learn, and if anyone  has more information or a book you can refer to me, I\u2019d appreciate it. Many thanks to all. \n  16Neil vN says  \nJanuary 1, 2010 at 3:44 pm  Aruna .. glad to hear it\u2019s starting to come together for you. As for a good book on flash photography? You could always check these one out. ;) \n  17Mario says  \nOctober 25, 2012 at 2:52 am  Hi Neil!\nI found this blog through Google, and I have a question I think you might be able to help me solve.\nI\u2019m an party photographer. I shoot people dancing and standing around in dimly-lit night clubs which also have disco and strobe lights around the room for ambiance.\nI\u2019ve incorporated the slow-shutter speed and resulting \u201clight trails\u201d into my signature style. I shoot with a Nikon D7000 with a SB700 speed light with wired attachment so I can do off-camera flashes that give me more dynamic shadows. My problem is this:\nWhen I shoot with a slow shutter speed (usually around 1\u2033 so that I can get lots of light trails) my flash has to fire first, and then the shutter closes a second after. The result of that is that the person I shot is lit-up first, and then the ambient light and light trails are recorded afterward, and they tend to cover-over top of the subject.\nHowever, when I used to shoot with my old SONY ALPHA 100, I used to have a flash attachment that I would keep unattached from the camera, and I\u2019d press the actual red \u201cflash\u201d button on it at what I guessed was the end of that 1\u2033 shutter speed. It was a very weird, basic, and crude way of doing a \u201cwireless rear-curtain sync\u201d, but it worked when I was just starting out. The result(when I did it correctly) was a photograph where all the ambient light and light trails were recorded to the image first, and then the subject was recorded on-top of those light trails, which kept the subject\u2019s facial features from being overtaken by the light trails. I stopped doing things that way because I had to manually focus and it took forever and the people in the clubs didn\u2019t want to wait around while I manually adjusted my focus every time. So, after that novel I just wrote, my actual problem is that I don\u2019t know if there is a way to disable the pre-flash on the rear-curtain sync mode, but that is what I really need. Even if it means not shooting in TTL mode. Like the other person stated above, I get a lot of people blinking or getting confused after the pre-flash and thinking that the photo had been taken. The wired attachment I use allows me to use an infra-red sensor in my hot-shoe that will focus the subject, which is great, but is there any way that the flash can just set off one flash, at the very end of the rear-curtain sync? Any insight you could give me would be much appreciated!\nThanks! \n  18Neil vN says  \nOctober 25, 2012 at 3:23 am  To avoid the pre-flash, use the flash in Auto or Manual. \n  19Sonia Lin says  \nSeptember 22, 2013 at 4:26 am  I really appreciate your article very much. Only through your article did I finally find out how to set my Nikon D7000 for a Rear Curtain Synch Flash if I need it for motion blur shot. Since it is not a setting from Menu for Flash, I searched everywhere (Google, YouTube, Nikon Menu, etc), no one shows or explains where on the camera to set the rear or front curtain flash.  What is \u201cModel Light\u201d in Nikon D7000? Is it a pre-flash? If I turn it off, would it help to avoid the eye close due to pre-flash? If I set as Manual, will there be no   pre-flash Flash?  Thank you very much. \n  20Phalon says  \nOctober 22, 2014 at 12:18 pm  Can you speak more on your \u201cblack foomie trick\u201d to get soft diffused shadows? \n  21Neil vN says  \nOctober 22, 2014 at 1:55 pm  Everything you\u2019d want to know about The Black Foamie Thing. \n  22Arun Vajpey says  \nDecember 19, 2015 at 5:54 am  Great article, Mr vN.  I know that I am not meant to but I have tried both slow-synch and rear curtain synch in certain holiday situations eg with people framed against a floodlit interesting background eg the Coliseum in Rome to get both well exposed. Also, I use a relatively small aperture in \u2018A\u2019 mode such situations to maximise DoF, which then slows down the shutter speed to make rear-curtain flash effective.  Theoretically, this should produce a picture in which both the subjects and the background are in the \u201cacceptable focus\u201d range and reasonably well exposed.  But in practice the trouble is, no matter how much I tell them beforehand, people, especially kids, react to any flash, whether first curtain of slow-synch or pre-flash of rear curtain. And the response is usually more than just blinking. IMO, an overwhelming majority of people are conditioned to think that the exposure is complete the moment they see a flash\u2026and start moving. What I would like \u2013 if such a thing is possible \u2013 is a rear-curtain flash facility without the pre-flash. Then the subjects will not recognize the initial opening of the shutter and will hold steady till the flash + shutter closure. \n  23Neil vN says  \nDecember 19, 2015 at 10:40 am  The only way around not having that pre-flash is to use the flash in Manual or Auto mode. That pre-flash is distinctly a side-effect of how TTL flash metering works. \n  23.1Arun Vajpey says  \nDecember 19, 2015 at 1:01 pm  Thank you. I own  a Nissin i40 and Olympus FL600R but the latter is undergoing repairs as its auto zoom function is jammed rendering it inoperable. The FL600R has its own light metering sensor and a true auto mode which the Nissin i40, great flash though it is, lacks. The Nissin\u2019s \u201cAuto\u201d mode is really nothing but a basic TTL function. \n  24Terry says  \nAugust 6, 2017 at 10:31 am  Hello Neil, So much interesting and valuable information on your blog, thanks for all the work and effort, much appreciated. With regard to your earlier follower\u2019s \u2018Blinkers\u2019 problem when using TTL with the pre-flash, I read recently on a Canon website that you can use FEL [flash exposure lock] to fire the pre-flash separately [star button on rear of my Canon 7D] the camera factors the resulting reflection light into its TTL calculation which is retained for a max of 16 sec, you therefore have this time before needing to press the shutter release to take the image. When the image is taken the camera fires the speedlite at the required output using the pre-flash data obtained earlier but this time it is a single flash. This method of using FEL to separate the pre-flash from the full flash might be a way to solve or reduce this Blinker issue, e.g. frame the shot, hit the allocated FEL button, the pre-flash fires, the Blinkers blink, the camera computes the required flash output [duration] then immediately hit the shutter release and hopefully capture the image without blinkers ruining it. What do you think, does this have possibilities? Terry Pullen \n  24.1Neil vN says  \nAugust 6, 2017 at 11:39 am  I just wonder if people will look away, thinking the photo was taken already? \n  25Beyti Barbaros says  \nJune 4, 2018 at 11:02 pm  What is the best way to combine long shutter speed at night and perfectly lit subject? I don`t want to see any moving patterns from the subject. I think rear curtain speed gives you that. Should I just shoot the background with slower shutter and shoot the subject with regular flash then combine them in photoshop? or does slow sync give me that? \n  26Neil vN says  \nJune 5, 2018 at 10:39 am  Hi there Beyti  I assume your subject is moving?\nThen there are a few factors that come into play:\nWill flash freeze movement at slow shutter speeds?

Los fabricantes han apostado muchas de sus fichas a este apartado implementando m\u00e1s c\u00e1maras y, m\u00e1s recientemente, sensores m\u00e1s grandes. En concreto, Huawei ha lanzado su Nova 4 con el sensor IMX586 de 48 megap\u00edxeles firmado por Sony, y Xiaomi ha hecho lo propio con el nuevo Redmi Note 7 y el sensor ISOCELL GM1 de Samsung, tambi\u00e9n de 48 megap\u00edxeles. Parece que volvemos a la olvidada guerra de los megap\u00edxeles, una batalla que actualmente se resume en una palabra: zoom. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 llegan ahora estos sensores? \u00bfQu\u00e9 ventajas ofrecen con respecto a los actuales? \u00bfC\u00f3mo afectar\u00e1n a la fotograf\u00eda? Arrojemos algo de luz. Tener m\u00e1s megap\u00edxeles nos da una ventaja y es que las fotos resultantes tendr\u00e1n un tama\u00f1o mayor. Con 48 megap\u00edxeles, la foto medir\u00e1 aproximadamente 8.000 x 6.000 p\u00edxeles. Si de esta imagen recortamos un fragmento de 4.000 x 3.000 megap\u00edxeles, este seguir\u00e1 teniendo un tama\u00f1o equivalente al que obtendr\u00eda una c\u00e1mara de 12 megap\u00edxeles, es decir, 1/4 de la foto original. \u00bfQu\u00e9 significa eso? Que podr\u00edamos seguir vi\u00e9ndola en la mayor\u00eda de pantallas sin que pierda calidad. En la pr\u00e1ctica es como hacer zoom pero sin recurrir a un sistema de lentes. De hecho, cuando hacemos zoom en un m\u00f3vil sin telefoto lo que estamos haciendo es exactamente eso, recortar un trozo de la imagen. Por eso se pixela si el sensor no tiene una resoluci\u00f3n alta. Los nuevos Sony IMX586 tienen una superficie de media pulgada, p\u00edxeles de 0,8 micr\u00f3metros y 48 megap\u00edxeles. A pesar de que no son los sensores m\u00e1s grandes, se valen de t\u00e9cnicas mejoradas de conversi\u00f3n fotoel\u00e9ctrica y recolecci\u00f3n de luz para que, aunque el tama\u00f1o del sensor no sea el m\u00e1s grande, no repercuta en la calidad final y no afecte al tama\u00f1o de la imagen final. Una de estas t\u00e9cnicas es el filtro de color Quad Bayer, mediante el cual se combinan dos p\u00edxeles (RGB) adyacentes para que tengan el mismo color, aumentando as\u00ed la sensibilidad del disparo, igual\u00e1ndola a la de los p\u00edxeles de 1,6 micr\u00f3metros. De esa forma se consigue m\u00e1s luz en escenas nocturnas y hasta cuatro veces m\u00e1s rango din\u00e1mico. Algo similar hacen los ISOCELL GM1 de 48 megap\u00edxeles de Samsung, que se valen de la tecnolog\u00eda pixel binning, aunque la firma coreana la ha bautizado como tecnolog\u00eda Tetracell. B\u00e1sicamente, lo que estos sensores hacen es combinar p\u00edxeles m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os para crear p\u00edxeles lo m\u00e1s grandes posibles. Esto es lo que hace Huawei con la tecnolog\u00eda Light Fusion, que combina (virtualmente) cuatro p\u00edxeles en uno, consiguiendo un tama\u00f1o de 1,55 micr\u00f3metros y permiti\u00e9ndoles captar m\u00e1s luz. Estos sensores llegan justo cuando las empresas han llegado a implementar hasta cuatro c\u00e1maras en un mismo dispositivo. El impulso vino con Apple y la doble lente del iPhone 7 Plus (lo que no quiere decir que no hubiera otros modelos antes), Huawei subi\u00f3 la apuesta a tres con el Huawei P20 Pro y Samsung a\u00f1adi\u00f3 una m\u00e1s en su Galaxy A9. Hasta Nokia parece estar trabajando en un Nokia 9 con cinco c\u00e1maras en la espalda. La idea de ofrecer tanta c\u00e1mara era sencilla: darle al usuario la posibilidad de sacar una foto normal o hacer zoom sin perder calidad mediante un teleobjetivo. Ah\u00ed tenemos a Huawei con el zoom \u00f3ptico x3 del Mate 20 Pro o el iPhone XS con sus dos aumentos. La raz\u00f3n de ser de los sensores de 48 megap\u00edxeles radica en que se puede conseguir un buen nivel de detalle al hacer zoom con una sola lente. \n    Compartir\n    \n           M\u00f3viles con c\u00e1maras de 48 megap\u00edxeles, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 volviendo la guerra de la resoluci\u00f3n?\n         \n Compartir Los mejores comentarios: Ver 3 comentarios En Xataka Android hablamos de...

It means that customer will not fallback to 3G/2G network while making/receiving calls. Normal 4G customers who are not using VoLTE, will fall back to 3G/2G network while making/receiving calls. VoLTE network offers less call setup time to make a call. Call setup time improves from 5-8 seconds to 1-4 seconds depending on the type of calls (i.e.; VoLTE to VoTE, VoLTE to Non-VoLTE or VoLTE to landlines). Crystal-clear HD-quality voice calls by using VoLTE service. How to check whether my Handset is VoLTE compatible or not. How to subscribe VoLTE services with free of charge? How to tune Handset setting to enable/disable VoLTE service? Please check the list below for the VoLTE compatible Handsets Brands and its model. iOS customers do not need this step, can directly go to step 3. Prepaid customers: Call: *979*5*8# Postpaid customers: Call: *999*5*1# Please click your Handset Brand: VoLTE voice/video call charging rate will be same as 2G/3G call charging rate according to the purchased voice pack. Video call charging rate will be 35MMK/min on pay-go. Voice over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE) means making voice calls over a 4G/LTE network, rather than 2G or 3G connections which are usually used. Utilizing IMS (IP Multimedia Service) technology, it is a digital packet voice service delivered over IP (Internet Protocol) via an LTE access network. This approach results in the voice service being delivered as data flows within the LTE network, which provides users with a number of advantages compared to other existing voice call networks. Go to Setting >> General >> About and it will show Carrier >> ATOM Myanmar 40.1 Go to Setting >> Cellular>> Cellular Data Options>>Voice & Data and check 4G,VoLTE off. No option to make VoLTE video call on iPhone. When making a call after VoLTE has been enabled, it will not fallback to CS (3G). In the case of customers using unlimited internet and the speed is being reduced when reach FUP, \u20184G calling VoLTE\u2019 for both video and voice call will be available normally since \u20184G calling VoLTE\u2019 does not deduct from package. It cannot because \u20184G calling VoLTE video cannot connect to different service provider networks (including the international calling). However, 4G calling VoLTE voice call can connect to different service provider Networks (including the international calling). For VoLTE roaming, please refer to detail at International Services.

He was widely regarded as one of the most powerful & influenced prime minister in India. Modi has been the chief minister of Gujarat for four consecutive terms. Modi journey from a humble background to achieving the greatest position is inspirational and incredible. In 2014 Narendra Modi led his Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) to a historic won( winning 284 seats out of 544) in Lok Sabha (Lower House in Indian Parliament) Elections. Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 in Vadnagar, a small town in Gujarat. Narendra Modi parents are Damodardas Mulchand Modi and Hiraben Modi. He was the third of six children in the family and his family belongs to Ghanchi Teli (Oil Presser) community in Gujarat. Narendra Modi family is very poor, In childhood, Modi worked with his father who sells tea at the Vadnagar railway station and also he ran a tea stall along with his brother near Vadnagar bus station. Modi did his schooling from Vadnagar. He graduated from Delhi University and he completed masters in political science from Gujarat University. At the age of 8, Modi joined RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh). RSS is a national patriotic organization which promotes Indian culture and moral values of civil society and also RSS offers selfless moral service to the nation with volunteers. During his college days, Modi worked as a Pracharak (Campaigner) in RSS organization. At a young age, Modi got married to Jashoda Ben. It was a child marriage which he reluctantly accepted.\nAt the age of 18, He left the home to travel around India. During this journey, Modi visited temples, religious organizations and met saints and new people. He was a hardcore follower of Swamy Vivekananda. He came home after two years of traveling and moved to Ahmedabad in 1971 where he became the fulltime worker in RSS. In 1975, prime minister Indira Gandhi imposed \u201cEmergency\u201d across the country. The emergency was in effect for 2 years, during this period political opponents were imprisoned, Press was censored and several human rights violations were reported. During the emergency period, people who raise the voice against the government were imprisoned and several organizations who criticize government activities were also put under banning list. During the emergency period, RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) was banned by the government and its main leaders were put behind the bars. Narendra Modi went underground and frequently traveled across Gujarat to avoid arrest and to protest against government decisions. Modi became involved in sending letters, printing pamphlets against a government and safeguard most wanted persons from the police. Modi\u2019s tactics and managerial skills gave him prominent recognition in the RSS. In 1978 Modi became the Sambhag Pracharak(regional organizer) in RSS. As a Sambhag Pracharak Modi worked in many cities in Gujarat and also went to other states. During this period he met many political leaders and worked with them. Modi became one of the key roles of people in RSS organization. With insist from RSS, Modi joined the political party BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) in 1985. Subsequently, Modi started working to organize BJP election campaigns in Gujarat and he led the BJP to win municipal elections in Ahmedabad. In 1990 Narendra Modi helped in organizing L.K Advani\u2019s Ram Rath Yatra and Murli Manohar Joshi\u2019s Ekta Yatra campaigns. Modi led the BJP to win Gujarat assembly elections in 1995 and 1998. The same year Modi was appointed as BJP general secretary. BJP central leaders were not happy with the performance of chief minister Keshubhai Patel. His government has failed to restore the damage which was happened during the Gujarat earthquake (Bhuj earthquake) and at the same time Keshubhai Patel was suffering from health problems and he could not handle the administration alone. The BJP center replaced Narendra Modi in the place of Keshubhai Patel. In 2001 Modi became the Chief Minister of Gujarat. On 27 February 2002, a train (Sabarmati Express) was burned near Godhra Railway station by an anonymous mob. It was carrying a large number of Karsevak\u2019s (Hindu Pilgrims or Ram Devotees) who were returning from the Ayodhya. Two train bogies were completely damaged with the fire and 59 people died and several persons were injured. Post this train incident, communal violence started in several places of Gujarat which was lasted for five days. Police curfew was implemented in all over Gujarat to control the situation. In the riots 1044 people have died, more than 2000 persons were injured and most of the people are displaced including children. Opposition parties and human rights organizations criticized the Narendra Modi government for not taking quick action to curb the riots. Some persons and media claimed Modi given free hand to the mob to create a nuisance on Muslims. Mainly the mainstream media portrayed Modi as he was responsible for the riots. The United States government also criticized and declined Visa to the Modi. They lift the Visa ban after Modi becoming Prime Minister. Modi was forced to step down as the chief minister due to the pressure from the opposition and his own party officials. He went for the elections in the same year, BJP got a massive victory and Modi was re-elected as the Chief Minister of Gujarat for the second time. In 2012 Special Investigation Team led by Supreme Court had found no guilty evidence against Modi in the 2002 riots and he has given clean chit by Supreme Court. In his second term, Modi did not focus on religious politics or religious issues. He implemented many schemes to control corruption in the state government departments and favored privatization. In 2007 elections BJP won 122 seats out of 182 and again Modi was re-elected as Chief Minister. In this term, Modi launched Vibrant Gujarat program to attract corporate and investors to invest in Gujarat and the state government made their policies to be business-friendly. During this term, many industries such as Tata Motors came to Gujarat and established their companies in Gujarat. The major achievement of the Modi government is bringing the electricity to every village in Gujarat which was widely appreciated by the whole nation. The government built more than 110,000 check dams to prevent underground water levels. The electricity and water conservation programs widely helped the Gujarat farmers and the Gujarat agriculture growth rate has been increased to 10.97 percent which was highest in India at that time. The Congress party and media are continuously mocked Narendra Modi about his role in the 2002 riots before every election. But Modi did not respond to their controversial comments and he silently indulged with his work. Overall, Gujarat became the developed state in India under Modi leadership. In 2012 elections BJP recorded victory and Modi was re-elected for the fourth time. In 2013 Modi was named the BJP\u2019s Prime Minister Candidate. Initially, several persons from the BJP expressed their opinion against Modi including BJP co-founder L.K Advani, but at the end, they were convinced and later they changed their opinion. In the election campaign, Modi promised to curb the corruption and mock the Congress party with their major scams and corruption scandals. In election campaigns, the Indian Congress party targeted Modi by linking 2002 Gujarat riots and portrayed him as a right-wing extremist leader. But however the result was different, people were not satisfied with Congress promises and they were annoyed with their previous government because of their poor administration and corruption scandals. In 2014 Lok Sabha elections BJP won 282 seats out of 543 which was the largest majority achieved by a single party since 1984. On 26 May Narendra Modi was sworn in as 15th Prime Minister of India.\nAs a Prime Minister Narendra Modi implemented many significant programs such as Make in India, Smart Cities, Digital India, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and GST (Goods and Services Tax). In 2016 Narendra Modi government demonetized 500, 1000 rupee currency notes, with the goal of curbing corruption, Naxalism and terrorism. This move resulted in the exponential growth in tax returns and digital payments. Make in India was a noteworthy scheme which encourages foreign companies to manufacture the products in India. It was started with the goal of changing India into a global manufacturing Hub. The GST was the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. Under the Modi leadership, Indian foreign policy has been improved, India improved its relations with all the major countries in Asia and in the world.

Since our phones are improving every year and we\u2019re now able to enjoy desktop-class websites on our mobile devices, we also needed network speeds to match. And typically a 3G connection can give you around 5-20 Mbps of speeds, if you have a good signal strength. 4G can technically give you around 150 Mbps of speeds, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019ve seen in our testing in Bangalore, ourselves. Without really going into the technical nitty-gritties, let\u2019s concentrate on the basic tech changes. 3G was an evolution over 2G mostly because data bandwidth was improved and users could then ejoy faster streaming and browsing. Voice calls could\u2019ve been potentially better too, but not like what we will now see with 4G. The 4G tech provided by Jio is completely IP based, meaning even voice calls connect over data network. This was what true 4G was designed on, but older players like Airtel and Vodafone built on their existing infrastructure that supported 2G/3G. This added advantage also gave Jio the room to implement LTE+, which is simply a more advanced (read: faster) version of 4G. The biggest change with LTE+ is the use of two bands to send data at the same time, resulting in lesser congestion and better throughput speeds. LTE-A (or LTE+) is merely a faster version of LTE, with a few\u00a0changes in the actual tech behind it. In some countries, LTE (acronym for Long Term Evolution, or just 4G) is supplemented with LTE-A, the A standing for Advanced. This is the same as LTE+, but since some countries pronounce tomatoes as ta-may-toes, we have some different terminologies for the same thing. Each new generation of wireless technology leaves older phones incompatible with them. So any phone that was made with 3G in mind, will not work on 4G, unless it has the specific hardware for it. Quite simply, new wireless tech has made older phone hardware obsolete. But even if your phone has 4G support, there are still some compatibility factors. This is when things get a little complex, but there is no way around it. To understand the issue, let\u2019s first understand that all wireless technology is possible on a limited bandwidth available. This bandwidth is allocated to different telecom companies in an auction and they can then build their networks on it. In India, we know that 4G is going to be offered in 3 bands initially (850 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 2300 MHz) and 700 MHz to follow in future and only Jio has PAN India license for the 2300 MHz spectrum. Now, all these bands are 4G, but maybe your phone can support completely different bands making it incompatible. The chances of newer phones being incompatible are quite rare, but phones like the Nexus 6 were incompatible with pre-Jio 4G networks in India. VoLTE stands for Voice over LTE and simply is the tech behind all your voice calls. And since Jio is the only carrier in India (so far) with an all IP network, it\u2019s going to roll out VoLTE as standard. Meaning, all your calls will be over the IP network, much like calling someone on WhatsApp. This move also enhances a users experience while browsing and taking calls at the same time. In older 3G services, we\u2019ve all experienced disrupted downloads and messages not going through when we (or the other person) gets a call. The same should technically not happen on VoLTE. Even the telecom standards say that VoLTE is the only way to provide Voice services over LTE, and VoLTE must provide HD Voice. Only then a network can be called a \u201cTrue 4G\u201d network. The only downside here is that when you are travelling to remote places in India without a reliable 4G network, you will be switched back to the older 2G/3G network. I don\u2019t suppose there should be any confusion between 3G, 4G, LTE, LTE-A and VoLTE. But, if there is something in particular that is bothering you, then catch us in our comments section.

But there can also be some struggles when calling someone. Choppy and broken calls are some of the things that can go wrong and we don\u2019t want to fuss ourselves over them. We all get exhausted from saying \u201chello\u201d again and again just to confirm if the person from the other line can hear us. The good thing is, there is a solution for that\u2014the VoLTE. Our calls will never be the same again, thanks to this new innovation in cellular technology. \u00a0 VoLTE stands for Voice over Long Term Evolution. It is intended to replace the current call technology that we have now. With the current technology, calls are transmitted to a separate channel, resulting in a speed downgrade of your internet connection whenever you make a call. VoLTE aims to be the catalyst for voice call technology today. VoLTE is a notable edge of 4G vs. 3G. You may have heard of the term LTE or Long Term Evolution, which is usually associated with 4G Broadband Internet. LTE is the measure for internet speed back when 3G is moving towards 4G. It was the predecessor of 4G so, LTE is slower for it was only a temporary technical standard of 4G Internet until true 4G speeds were reached. The LTE technology was not initially intended for daily voice calls, but a push from major telecom companies around the world made VoLTE possible. VoLTE services commercially rolled out in 2012, which made it the gold standard of voice calling. The main objective of this is to make all our voice calls relayed to VoIP or \u201cVoice over Internet Protocol.\u201d VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling are examples of VoIP services. \u00a0 What VoLTE does is to carry your calls to an LTE network. Instead of legacy voice networks, it transmits data over the Internet, resulting in clearer calls. LTE has a higher bandwidth so it can handle not just audio calls but also video calls. With this in mind, VoLTE is an additional Internet service that carriers provide without charging any extra fees to you. Unlike the previous technology, where you may notice a steep decline in your internet speed during a call, VoLTE lets you browse the Internet seamlessly while still maintaining a high-definition call. Some carriers call this service HD voice. Nevertheless, the concept of VoLTE is essentially the same which is to you a hassle-free audio call experience like never before. \u00a0 Most of the phones today are VoLTE-ready. Some old phones that are capable of 4G have VoLTE functionality in it. Therefore, you don\u2019t really need to change your phone if you want to avail of this new service. Even phones released in 2014 like the iPhone 5S, Samsung Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note 2 LTE, and Moto X can do 4G calls. If you are not sure if your phone is VoLTE-capable, you may ask your carrier if your phone model has this voice call technology. If you\u2019re on a hunt for an upgrade, now is the right time to choose the right phone for you, so you can elevate your everyday call experience. On the bright side, you do not need to shell out tons of money to upgrade your phone. For starters, you can buy a decent VoLTE-capable phone for $100-$250. Usually, VoLTE automatically turns on if you\u2019re in the middle of a call. However, you may notice that the clarity of your calls will still be the same old grainy calls, for some phones will not let you simply turn this feature on. There are different ways to turn on VoLTE on different phones. On the iPhone, you can turn this on by going to Settings>Cellular>Cellular Data Options, then select \u201cLTE.\u201d On some Android phones, this setting is usually found on the \u201cConnections\u201d or \u201cWi-Fi/mobile network\u201d option. \u00a0 Currently, all of the major carriers like Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T have VoLTE services. Minor and prepaid carriers are also following suit on the rollout of VoLTE. Better prepare yourself to change that old phone for most of the carriers are planning to shut down their 2G and 3G services in the coming years. Verizon has shut down their 2G services last December 2019 and plans its 3G shutdown this coming December 2020. T-Mobile and Sprint are reportedly shutting down their 3G services as well by 2021. So if you are subscribed to them, better upgrade your phone if it is still not 4G-capable. US Cellular has recently implemented its \u201cEnhanced Calling\u201d feature, which is their version of VoLTE. If you\u2019re on a tight budget, you can still save up so you can buy a phone that\u2019s VoLTE-equipped so you would not get behind the trend. Then again, the good news is you do not need to buy an uber-expensive phone to get VoLTE. \u00a0 VoLTE and Wi-Fi Calling are both VoIPs. As mentioned above, VoIP or \u201cVoice over Internet Protocol\u201d carries your voice calls to the Internet. They both provide higher quality calls and simultaneous Internet access and voice calls. They also enable you to connect faster on your calls. But there is a key difference in how VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling works. Wi-Fi calling works when you are connected to a Wi-Fi source. It enables you to call even in areas with a poor cellular signal. On the other hand, VoLTE relies on LTE networks, which is a type of cellular connection. There\u2019s a quick way to check the network coverage in your area. If your area is not yet covered by LTE or 4G, then you won\u2019t get this feature too. What\u2019s good about Wi-Fi calling is that it enables you to call whenever you are connected to a Wi-Fi hotspot. Whether you\u2019re in a basement or a deserted town, as long as you are connected to a Wi-Fi hotspot, you can make a high-quality call to anyone wherever and whenever. But once you get out of the Wi-Fi hotspot, your calls may go back to that choppy, muffled, and rugged voice you usually hear in a typical call. The good news is, VoLTE can save the day. If ever you\u2019re cut off from Wi-Fi, your LTE connection will continue to transmit that call, provided that you are covered by an LTE tower. In cases of low reception, there are ways to boost your mobile coverage so you won\u2019t get cut off from VoLTE. \u00a0 With the continuing rollout of VoLTE all around the US, it surely gives the benefits that can elevate our daily call experience. Here are the benefits of having VoLTE in your calls. \u00a0 Even though VoLTE carries calls like how you transmit data on the Internet, it does not charge you extra on your calls. Carriers will still charge you per minute on your monthly bill, so you don\u2019t have to worry about bill shocks. There\u2019s no more need to call through a third-party app if you want higher quality calls. Just go ahead and call your loved ones. \u00a0 You don\u2019t need to open Skype or Messenger anymore. With VoLTE, video calls are now possible without using any other video messaging apps. With its higher bandwidth, it can make video calls without using the Internet. You won\u2019t only hear your loved ones on the other line but also see how are they doing. Although it is still in its infancy, group or conference calls can also be possible. Ideally speaking, VoLTE technology can handle up to six persons, provided that they are all connected through Wi-Fi or VoLTE. As of now, there are no carriers that offer this service, but we are all hoping that this will be possible in the future. \u00a0 Since VoLTE allows more bandwidth for calls, it provides for higher quality calls than the legacy technology. You may notice that the audio quality on both ends is clearer and makes you connect to the other person quicker. Disconnections are also rare, thanks to its faster end-to-end connection. \u00a0 Once you are in a call, your ability to surf the Internet is limited because you will be forced to revert back to 3G technology, resulting in a slower Internet connection. But you don\u2019t have to worry about that anymore; VoLTE lets you browse the Internet while still maintaining that high-quality call. You can watch some funny YouTube shorts while in the midst of a VoIP call. Or maybe, you want to check out some tweets of your favorite artist. As long as you are connected to a 4G network, your call will not be interrupted and your Internet will not bog down. \u00a0 With this latest innovation in technology, it is not without hiccups. Here are some things that need to be improved with VoLTE. \u00a0 While it can possibly handle video calls and group calls, some networks will still charge you on your data usage, especially if you are doing video calls. Verizon, for instance, charges your data consumption whenever you make a video call using VoLTE. An average one-minute call will consume 6-8 MB of data. So watch out for your data usage if you are using VoLTE for your video calls. If you need to do video calls, better connect to Wi-Fi and use video conferencing apps instead. \u00a0 Though most of the carriers are now catering VoLTE, some areas still have limited coverage of this technology. Since VoLTE is still being rolled out today, expect your calls to be a little bit unstable for now. Since Wi-Fi technology is more widely used, Wi-Fi calling has wider and better coverage than VoLTE. So, if you want consistently clear voice calls, better stick with Wi-Fi calling, or use third-party apps like Messenger or WhatsApp. \u00a0 Yes, you may have a VoLTE-capable phone, but the people you want to call may not have such a feature on their phone. So, you will still be stuck with that traditional call you were used to. \u00a0 If you are a frequent traveler, there are chances that you might not get VoLTE in countries you are traveling into. Better check with your carrier if VoLTE can be used in other countries. Alternatively, you can use third-party messaging apps like Messenger, Zoom, and Skype, or use Wi-Fi calling if you want those crystal clear calls. \u00a0 As time passes by, technology becomes more advance and even our staple calls will change. Of course, we want to hear our loved ones or colleagues clearly, so having VoLTE is a great advantage for us. We should not let ourselves get behind this trend. VoLTE truly revolutionizes the way we connect to the world, one call at a time. Not sure if you are covered by LTE? Here\u2019s how to locate a cell tower map near you.

Here\u2019s how it works.  Your camera is set to 'front curtain' flash by default, but sometimes you need 'rear curtain' flash instead. Here's why  Flashguns produce a very short, intense burst of light. The flash 'duration' is very short, typically 1/500sec or even 1/1000sec, even though you will usually be working with much slower shutter speeds, and hence longer exposures, than that. This means you have a choice about when the flash fires during the exposure \u2013 at the start (first-curtain sync) or at the end (rear-curtain sync). The 'curtain' is part of the focal plane shutter design of DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. The first curtain of the shutter moves aside to expose the sensor, the second moves across an instant later to cover it up again. By default, a flash fires when the shutter curtains open to expose the camera sensor to light, enabling you to time shots to perfection. The flash is providing the main illumination and will fire the instant you press the shutter release.\u00a0 Knowing exactly when the flash will fire is important, which is why this is the default flash mode setting. However, if you are using slow-sync flash technique to combine the 'freezing' effect of flash and the existing ambient light, you will need to extend the eposure to record that dimmer background lighting. If you do this with a moving subject you will get an. odd effect where the blur trail of the subject is in front of it, not behind it, which is not what we expect motion blur to look like. In this mode, the flash fires at the end of the main exposure, not at the start. Any motion blur recorded at the start of the exposure will now trail behind the subject, creating a more natural result.\u00a0 However, this makes timing your shots more difficult because you have to gauge where your subject will be in the frame at the end of the exposure. With this technique, it's easy to mis-time it and have your subject exiting the frame before the flash fires.  For regular flash photography and when you're not trying to capture movement blur in your subject, the default front- or first-curtain sync mode is best. It's easier to time your shots and you can still balance flash with ambient light. The effects of rear-curtain sync flash are only obvious at slower shutter speeds and when you want to capture moving subjects both sharply (with the flash) and as a blur trail (with a longer exposure). Try using it at night when shooting cars: the trails created by the headlights will add a real sense of speed.

His rise from tea vendor to Prime Minister of the world\u2019s greatest democracy has been amazing. Modi\u2019s supporters frequently refer to him as NaMo. He is a self-made leader who comes from a non-political household. Narendra Modi is a great inspiration for all Indians. After clearing the limit set by a poor tea-selling youngster, he became India\u2019s Prime Minister. \n\n\n\nHe has effortlessly transitioned into a development-oriented leader. On September 17, 1950, Narendra Damodardas Modi was born. He is a well-known individual who has shown that success is not dependent on caste. It makes no difference where a person comes from or what their history is. Narendra Modi is regarded as a skilled strategist who has become a ray of hope for India\u2019s billions of people. He is one of the leaders who keeps an eye on the future. Late Damodardas Mulchand Modi and Heeraben Damodardas Modi had a magnificent son named Narendra Modi. When their mother was alive, none of the prime ministers had entered office. Mr. Modi is the one who made history. Narendra Damodardas Modi was born in Vadnagar, Bombay State (now Gujarat), India on September 17, 1950 (age 71 as of 2021). Narendra Modi was born in Vadnagar, Bombay State (now Gujarat), India, into a grocer\u2019s family. He is a member of the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-pressing) community, which is classified as OBC. He was born to Late Damodardas Mulchand Modi and Heeraben Modi. He has a strong bond with his mother.  Modi was on the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra when his father died of bone cancer in 1989. Narendra Modi has four brothers: Soma Modi (a retired health department officer), Amrut Modi (a lathe machine operator), Prahlad Modi (who owns an Ahmedabad shop), and Pankaj Modi (Clerk in the Information Department in Gandhinagar). Vasantiben Hasmukhlal Modi is his sister\u2019s name. He attended Higher Secondary School in Vadnagar, Gujarat. He was an average student who enjoyed debating in school. Modi was greatly interested in entering the Indian Army and also attempted to enrol in a Sainik School. His request, however, could not be granted owing to budgetary restrictions. He used to help his father sell tea at the Vadnagar Railway Station when he was a kid. Later, he and his brother established a tea stand near a bus stop. Modi left his home at the age of 17 and travelled around India.  After two years, he returned home and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science from Delhi University (Distance Education) and a master\u2019s degree in political science from Gujarat University. He used to serve as a promoter for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh throughout his college days (RSS). Later, while acting as the BJP\u2019s official spokesperson in New Delhi, he attended a three-month course in Image Management and Public Relations in the United States. \u00a0 Narendra Modi was engaged to Jashodaben when he was quite young and married her when he was 18 years old.

He later ran in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation elections and gave the party its first-ever victory. Later, in 1990, he assisted in the execution of L.K. Advani\u2019s Ayodhya Rath Yatra, following which his talents were widely acknowledged inside the party.  Modi was instrumental in increasing the BJP\u2019s presence in Gujarat. Modi was chosen as the BJP\u2019s National Secretary in November 1995, following which he went to Delhi to oversee efforts in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. In May 1998, he was appointed General Secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a post in which he assisted his party in winning the 1998 Lok Sabha elections. Later, Modi ran in the Gujarat Assembly Elections for the first time and was elected as Gujarat\u2019s Chief Minister on October 3, 2001. He held the position till 2014. He was then named to the BJP Parliamentary Board in March 2013. Modi was chosen as the BJP\u2019s Prime Ministerial candidate in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, despite opposition from several party officials. However, in the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections, he won both seats (Varanasi and Vadodara) and became India\u2019s 14th Prime Minister on May 26, 2014. He trounced his closest competitor, Arvind Kejriwal, from the Varanasi Constituency, by a whopping 3,71,784 votes. The BJP, led by Narendra Modi, won more than 300 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Modi trounced his nearest challenger Shalini Yadav of the Samajwadi Party by a massive 4,79,505 vote margin, which was significantly greater than the previous margin in the 2014 elections. On May 30, 2019, Narendra Modi took the oath of office as India\u2019s 15th Prime Minister at the Rashtrapati Bhawan.    Narendra Modi, India\u2019s Prime Minister, is paid roughly Rs. 160,000 per month with other allowances, with a net worth of around Rs. 2.5 crore (as of 2019). Modi has movable assets worth $128,50,498. This includes a bank balance of 11,29,690 in SBI\u2019s Gandhinagar NSCH Branch, a Fixed Deposit and MOD (Multi Option Deposit Scheme) of 1,07,96,288 in the same branch, Infrastructure Bond Deposits (tax saving) worth 20,000 (dated 25 January 2012), National Saving Certificate (Post) worth 5,18,235, a Life Insurance (LIC) Policy of 1,59,281 (as on Modi also has a residential home worth one crore rupees in Gandhinagar.

Phone makers have largely offered 12MP main cameras for a few years now, and who can blame them? 12MP cameras strike a great balance between resolution and sensor size, as evident by Google\u2018s and Samsung\u2018s flagship phones over the past three or four years. But 2018 saw the leap to 40MP for Huawei, with some interesting results. Now, it seems like 2019 could be the year of the 48MP camera, as several phone makers adopt the technology for their phones. The two biggest camera sensor manufacturers,\u00a0Sony and Samsung, are leading the charge, as they both bring 48MP sensors to market. The Japanese company has the IMX586 sensor, while the Korean conglomerate is touting the ISOCELL GM1. And between the resolution, pixel size, and pixel binning approach, we\u2019ve got two extremely similar sensors. Ordinarily, a 48MP camera sensor squeezed into your typical smartphone presents several problems. An increase in resolution should ideally go hand-in-hand with a bump in sensor size to maintain low-light performance, but a larger sensor usually results in a big camera hump or a thicker phone. The other alternative is to keep the sensor the same size. But cramming all those pixels onto a small sensor means the individual pixels have to be smaller in order to fit. And smaller pixels are simply unable to adequately capture enough light for night-time shots. Think of it like collecting rain in buckets. A 25-liter bucket (larger pixel) is simply going to collect more rain (light) than a 10-liter bucket (smaller pixel). Chipset and secondary camera support is another concern when it comes to 48MP cameras. The vast majority of chipsets don\u2019t explicitly support 48MP cameras, let alone a 48MP camera paired up with a secondary shooter. In fact, the Snapdragon 855, Snapdragon 675, and MediaTek Helio P90 seem to be some of the only chipsets specifically supporting 48MP shots right now (and Qualcomm\u2019s chips don\u2019t mention dual camera support in this regard). This brings to mind the Nokia Lumia 1020 back in 2013, as the device\u2019s Snapdragon S4 Plus chip didn\u2019t actually support a 41MP camera. This forced Nokia to essentially graft support into the hardware. The result was indeed a proper 41MP smartphone, albeit one with horrendous shot-to-shot and processing times. We could be seeing something similar with Xiaomi\u2019s Redmi Note 7, a 48MP smartphone that uses the Snapdragon 660. This chipset doesn\u2019t support 48MP shooters, according to the spec sheet, but Xiaomi seems to have found a solution anyway. Hopefully we don\u2019t have a laggy mess of an experience\u2026 Chipsets have come a long way from the days of dual-core 32-bit designs though, so single-shot performance should be pretty brisk. But the popularity of features like HDR+ and night mode means these chipsets might have to deal with a ton of data in some situations. It\u2019s also encouraging to see the few announced 48MP devices all offering a secondary camera of some kind. However, with the exception of the Huawei Nova 4, most of these devices have a secondary depth or 3D sensor rather than a telephoto, monochrome, or wide-angle snapper. Samsung and Sony aren\u2019t merely producing a 48MP sensor for bragging rights or great daytime detail\u00a0\u2014 although I do look forward to daytime results. The companies are using a technique called pixel binning to overcome the downsides of a 48MP sensor (i.e. poor low-light shots). Pixel binning is one of the most reliable ways to get better photos on your smartphone, being done on the likes of the LG G7, Huawei P20 Pro, Huawei Mate 20 Pro, and scores of budget phones. This process sees information from four neighbouring pixels combined into one, in order to produce a brighter overall image.\u00a0In essence, they\u2019re combining four smaller rain buckets to make one big bucket. This approach allows\u00a0cameras to maintain sensor size while still getting good night-time snaps. Pixel binning isn\u2019t without disadvantages though, as you end up with a much lower resolution image than the camera sensor is capable of spitting out. For example, the LG G7 uses pixel binning on its 16MP main camera for brighter low-light shots, churning out a 4MP snap in the process. Four megapixels is a pretty low resolution (HTC One, anyone?), but you could technically get a higher output resolution if you used a higher resolution camera to begin with. Huawei\u2019s devices take this approach, spitting out 10MP pixel-binned snaps from a 40MP primary camera. And then you have Sony\u2019s and Samsung\u2019s new sensors, which adopt a 48MP resolution to bring us 12MP pixel-binned shots. This is roughly the same output resolution as 2018 flagship phones like the Google Pixel 3 and Samsung Galaxy S9. The new 48MP camera sensors predictably have smaller pixels than your traditional 12MP smartphone though. They both feature\u00a0tiny 0.8 micron pixels, while the Galaxy S9\u2019s main camera packs 1.4 micron pixels; even the OnePlus 6T\u2018s 16MP main shooter has 1.22 micron pixels. But Samsung and Sony say their sensors give you the equivalent of a 12MP 1.6 micron pixel image when taking a pixel-binned shot. Check out Sony\u2019s image below for a better idea of the setup.  Sony also provided a sample shot at the time of its announcement, comparing it to a traditional 12MP snap in broad daylight. The real test will come in low light though, but you can check out the comparison below.  As the photo suggests, it looks like 48MP shots could also enable better zoom than solutions seen on your standard single-camera smartphone. This is because you should be able to simply crop into the high-resolution image to get good results (at least when pixel binning isn\u2019t enabled). It\u2019s unclear whether we can expect results that are better than a telephoto camera or computational efforts, but it\u2019s definitely got potential.  The Honor View 20 is perhaps the most prominent device with a 48MP camera, and the first samples seem to be pretty encouraging. You can also expect a Kirin 980 chipset, up to 8GB of RAM, 128GB or 256GB of expandable storage, and a secondary 3D camera next to the 48MP snapper. Huawei also revealed the Nova 4 last month, swapping out the Kirin 980 chipset for the older Kirin 970 processor. But the rear camera combination consists of the 48MP primary snapper, a 16MP ultra wide angle camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. Chinese brand Hisense hopped aboard the 48MP bandwagon at CES, with the\u00a0U30. The phone packs a Snapdragon 675 chipset, the expected 48MP snapper, and a 5MP secondary camera for depth effects. Xiaomi also revealed the Redmi Note 7 this month, offering a 48MP rear camera alongside a 5MP secondary shooter. The brand is opting for a Snapdragon 660 chipset and a Samsung-made sensor, but confirmed that it would offer the Redmi Note 7 Pro with a Sony-made sensor. It\u2019s too early to say whether the foray into 48MP sensors will result in amazing pictures, but adoption by so many brands certainly seems to suggest that Samsung and Sony impressed manufacturers with their sensor tech. We\u2019ll need to put these phones to the test before we reach a verdict, but, even if the pixel-binned approach on its own doesn\u2019t yield amazing results, OEMs have a ton of image processing tech at their disposal. Imagine a 12MP pixel-binned shot combined with Night Mode or Google\u2019s HDR+\u2026 NEXT: Interpreter Mode allows Google Home to translate conversations in real-time"], "https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/VAJUBHAI-VALA": [" Access the best of Getty Images and iStock with our simple subscription plan.

And if you are reading this article, you surely have seen some weird trend cropping up in the smartphone cameras.  For the last couple of years, we have seen 12MP sensors become the norm in most smartphone cameras. But this year, we are suddenly seeing a jump to 40MP or 48MP sensors. So, many of you including us probably have many questions about these cameras. Are they better than the 12MP sensor used in most flagship devices? What is the advantage of having a larger MP count? How are these sensors different than the normal 12MP or 16MP cameras? We will try to answer most of your questions in this article. The smartphone that has got most people talking about the 48MP camera in Nepal is Redmi Note 7. And some of you pointed out to us during the live unboxing of this phone that the processor in the Redmi Note 7, Qualcomm Snapdragon 660, does not support a sensor as large as this one. So, how did Xiaomi manage to put the 48MP sensor in the smartphone then? Is it all just a hoax or a marketing gimmick? The answer is\u2026 it\u2019s complicated. The camera system on a smartphone is complex. There are many filters, and lenses, and a mindboggling post processing involved that contribute to the image that you see on your smartphone screen. So, for most of you out there, you shouldn\u2019t even be thinking about the MP count on your smartphone camera because that\u2019s not the only thing that affects the image quality. There are myriad of other factors. You should read reviews of the camera and look at photo samples to see if you like the photos or not. If possible, take photos with the phone yourself in the smartphone store. But if you are still interested to understand how a 48MP camera works, I will tell you about it. When the light that flows through the camera lens, it is captured by a component inside the camera called the\u00a0Image Sensor. The image sensor has millions of light capturing wells or cavities called photosites. Each of these photosites have specific locations and are arranged in rows and columns like a spreadsheet. Photosites are also called pixels (for cameras). So, larger pixel count means that the camera has more of these pixels. What is the benefit of having more pixels? The distinction between the intensity of the light hitting the photosites become finer as you increase the pixels. This means better detail in the photos. So that\u2019s amazing. You should definitely increase the MP count on your smartphone camera if you can, right? Not so fast. There\u2019s one problem. Smartphones don\u2019t have much space in them to fit large sensors. So, when you increase the number of pixels on your camera sensor, the overall size of the sensor can\u2019t change that much. This means that the size of the pixels themselves will shrink. While a normal 12MP camera may have the pixel size of 1.4 or 1.6 microns, the 48MP sensor can manage up to 0.8 microns. What happens when the size of the pixel decreases? The amount of light that it captures also decreases. Here, many people give the example of a bucket capturing rain water. Suppose you are collecting rain water. If you have larger bucket, you\u2019ll collect more water, if you have a smaller bucket, you\u2019ll collect less water. That\u2019s exactly what happens. Less light means poor low light performance and difficulty capturing moving objects resulting in blurry images. This is the reason why the smartphone camera world has made peace with 12MP sensors. They give the perfect balance between resolution and pixel sizes. Then why is there suddenly this jump towards higher MP sensors? Why are we seeing better low light performance with these higher MP cameras rather than a poor one? This is all thanks to a new type of color filter. I told you that when light enters through the lens, it is captured in the photosites of the image sensors. But I left one thing out there. Before the light reaches the image sensor, it passes through something called a color filter. And you probably guessed its purpose by its name. This filter is what gives color to the images. Without this filter, the image produced would be grayscale.  The most popular color filter used in smartphone and other digital cameras is called Bayer filter. It is represented as this array of red, blue, and green color filter. You can see that there\u2019s more green than red or blue in this array. That is intentional because bayer filter was made to resemble the human eye and human eye is more sensitive to green. Anyway, as there is a color filter above the sensor, not all light can be captured by the image sensor. Only the light that the particular unit of the color filter lets in will be captured by the sensor. That means the sensor will only capture 1/3rd of the total light that comes through the lens. The pixel below the blue filter will only capture the intensity of blue light. The information on the intensity of the Red light and green light in the white light is lost. But we see a full-color picture on our screens. How is that possible if 2/3rd of the light is lost? We now enter the realm of post-processing. The phone approximates the intensity of the other two lights in a particular photosite. There are many algorithms to do this and this whole process is called demosaicing. What these new 48MP sensors have is a new color filter called quad-Bayer filter. Just see the picture below and you\u2019ll understand. In the quad Bayer setup, instead of having alternating color filters above each pixel, you have four pixels grouped in a square share the same color filter.  What is the purpose of this? When you increase the pixel count, you decrease its size. And that adversely affects the quality of the photos. What these new large sensors are doing is that they are combining the data from the four different pixels under the same color filter into a single pixel. This can be done thanks to quad Bayer filter. By combining raw data from four pixels into one, we get higher amount of light captured in a single pixel while reducing the noise generated (more samples so less noise). This process of combining the data of two or more pixels into one is called Pixel binning. This eliminates the defect of having a small pixel size. But this also effectively produces 1/4th resolution image. So, a 48MP sensor produces 12MP images and this is what is happening with phones like Redmi Note 7. The result is better dynamic range, better contrast, and better low-light performance. Phones like the P30 pro and Mate 20 pro take this even further by exposing two pixels in the square more than the other two pixels. They combine this data to produce better HDR images. This process seems to have real merits as the cameras from Huawei have been lauded by many reviewers as the best in the market.  Of course, we haven\u2019t covered every minute detail about pixel binning in this article. If you want to dig deeper into this fascinating world of digital photography, you can do so by all means.

It\u2019s voice calls over a\u00a04G LTE network, rather than the 2G or 3G connections which are usually used. We tend to think of\u00a04G\u00a0as mostly being about downloading, streaming and web browsing, and indeed that\u2019s primarily what it\u2019s been used for so far, but it can\u00a0also be used to improve calls. The big advantage of VoLTE is that call quality is superior to 3G or 2G connections as far more data can be transferred over 4G than 2G or 3G. Up to three times as much data as 3G and up to six times as much as 2G to be precise, making it easier to make out not only what the person on the other end of the line is saying, but also their tone of voice. Essentially it\u2019s an HD voice call and it\u2019s a much richer experience over all. VoLTE can connect calls up to twice as fast as the current methods and as 2G and 3G connections will still be available when there\u2019s no 4G signal it simply means that there\u2019s greater mobile coverage overall, as currently places with a 4G signal but no 2G or 3G means that on you\u00a0can\u2019t make or receive calls.  You might think that would be a rare occurrence, but some of the frequencies that 4G operates on, such as the 800MHz spectrum, have far greater reach than 2G or 3G spectrum, so you\u2019ll be able to get signal further away from a mast or in buildings which other signals struggle to penetrate. Indeed, Three is fully relying on its 800MHz spectrum for VoLTE calls. However, while 2G and 3G services would likely remain they wouldn\u2019t be as necessary as they are now and much of the spectrum used for 2G in particular could potentially be repurposed to increase capacity on 4G networks. Anyone who currently uses 4G could also find their battery life increased with VoLTE, as without it\u00a0whenever you make or receive a call your phone has to switch from 4G to 2G or 3G, since 4G calls aren\u2019t supported\u00a0and then once the call is finished it switches back again. All that switching, plus the need to search for a different signal each time, can give the battery a significant hit. \u200bIt\u2019s also theoretically possible to make video calls over 4G, much like a Skype call except you\u2019d just use your mobile number and be able to use the regular dialler and call interface, so you can make and receive video calls from anyone else with VoLTE, rather than relying on separate accounts. In fact you may have noticed that Skype and other existing video calls services often seem to have superior audio quality to voice calls. That\u2019s because like VoLTE they use more data as part of a similarly named VoIP system, so you can expect your voice calls to start sounding more like Skype calls, but they won\u2019t hit your battery life as much as Skype does. Not only could video calls become native to the dialler, but other Rich Communication Services (or RCS\u2019s) could as well, such as file transferring, real time language translation and video voicemail and there may be applications which haven\u2019t even been thought up yet. It\u2019s not available everywhere on every network, or on every handset, so you may or may not be able to use VoLTE \u2013\u00a0 check with your carrier.

SSDs are quicker, a lot more long lasting and also total a much better alternative contrasted to HDDs. Yet which SSD in regards to ability must you purchase. Is an excellent ol\u2019 512 SSD helpful for pc gaming?  A 512 SSD is excellent sufficient for pc gaming or any type of various other efficiency relevant job actually.  The majority of computer video games will certainly have running data in the 30GB \u2013 50GB area \u2013 the Witcher 3 (which is one hell of an efficiency extensive video game) has a 50GB mount data dimension for example. When you consider running system data which generally inhabit 15GB of disk area, it\u2019s simple to see why a 512GB SSD is ample for pc gaming.  Provided our quote of 30GB \u2013 50GB per video game mount plus running system data, a 512GB SSD must have the ability to sustain the mount and also run needs for a minimum of 8 video games at any type of point. As long as you\u2019re not intending on having a lot of video game mounts on your pc gaming PC/laptop, a 512 SSD will certainly suffice to run your favored video games simultaneously.  Keep in mind that you can constantly uninstall old video games to compose area for brand-new ones as soon as you have actually finished them.  At the base degree the feature of any type of storage space gadget on your computer is, well, to save information. Whether it\u2019s an SSD, or a HDD, or perhaps a DRAM gadget, it\u2019s task is to save information. The quantity of information any type of storage space gadget can save is specified by its ability.  So a 512GB SSD can save specifically 512GB of information which in real life terms equates to concerning 64,000 images, 1200 video clips and also 400 applications. Both a 512GB SSD and also a 512GB HDD will certainly save the very same quantity of information. The distinction in between both is exactly how that information is saved and also the efficiency qualities of each.  As well as not simply saving transferring it also which is where they offer you a benefit as a player. SSDs have quicker create and also review rates which is a means of claiming they manage saving (creating) and also transferring (analysis) information much better than HDDs.  Well, as a video game operates on your computer, it carries out a great deal of read and also create occasions. When you\u2019re delicately strolling on a map, video games draw information (read) from your storage space gadget to make use of in providing the scene. Often times, this analysis is dynamically dealt with by your RAM, which is one more sort of faster storage space tools with little to no latency. Various other times video games can fill possessions straight from your storage space gadget. Inevitably also the information made use of by your RAM is prefetched from your SSD.  Taken with each other an excellent SSD with it\u2019s faster read/write rate enhances pc gaming experience by:  Read More: Galaxy Vs Universe: Which Is Bigger?  Ever before needed to endure a 5 mins long filling display? \u2026 followers will certainly connect. To fill a scene or a degree of video game (like the filling period when you\u2019re done selecting groups and also establishing developments on PES) your computer system requires to collect all the needed possessions from your SSD and also dispose it right into your RAM. The RAM after that feeds the video game software application at the lightning checked out rates it can.  With a rapid SSD this first prefetch is finished quicker! Sluggish storage space tools like HDDs take even more time to send the required information to your computer\u2019s RAM.  Review occasions \u2013 information transmission from your SSD can take place and also extremely commonly do take place also after you have actually transcended filling displays. Notification exactly how some video game possessions in \u2026 onl show up when you go close sufficient? In many cases, the restricting variable, what will certainly create video game components to fill rapid or gradually is your GPU or RAM. Nonetheless, if you have actually obtained a strong GPU and also RAM however a not so rapid key storage space gadget, after that delays may take place. Great SSDs stop this.  One location where you\u2019ll most definitely really feel the influence of a rapid SSD is throughout video game installs and also updates. Setting up or upgrading a video game calls for a crazy quantity of read/write occasions, every one of that 30 -50 GB allotment we spoke about previously.  HDDs generally max out at read/write rates 300MBs/70MBs. At that price it might take anywhere in between 20 mins to mount the ordinary computer video game.  SSDs can get to read/write rates of approximately 4GB/9GB. The very same video game that  would certainly take 20 minutes to mount with a HDD as the information resource may mount in much less than 5 mins with an SSD. If you make use of video game repacks (hi, Fitgirl repacks) an SSD is sort of has to other than you intend on waiting half a day to mount several of the more recent gen video game titles.  Purely talking the solution is no. No, a disk drive, nonetheless performant it is can not boost your FPS. FPS or structure per secondly is straight dependent on your CPU, graphics card and also to a minimal level your motherboard. Various other points that influence FPS far from your control is the video game software application itself, video game setups and also code optimization.  If you\u2019re seeking to boost your FPS, you\u2019re much better off updating your CPU and also GPU initially.  So you\u2019re claiming, simply obtain a 512GB SSD and also my pc gaming experience must instantly be ended up being leading brass. Waoh, chillout, I never ever claimed that. A 512GB SSD can make your pc gaming experience much better, however generally, there\u2019s a whole lot even more to think about. Your CPU for example, your RAM additionally, you GPU extremely significantly and also also THE KIND OF SSD issues.  Strong state drives are not produced equivalent and also while a base SSD must surpass a leading brass HDD, there\u2019s a distinction in efficiency amongst the various kinds of SSDs. Read More: Uber vs. Lyft: Whos tops in the battle of U.S. rideshare companies  This can obtain technological and also rapid however allow\u2019s simply effort to make points easy.  SSDs can be categorized based upon 2 metrics:   Based upon type variable you can either have an M. 2 or 2.5 inch SSD. M. 2 is the a lot more current, sleeker construct that looks a whole lot like an SD card (a bit larger however you understand). 2.5 inch SSDs are chunkier and also are of older gen innovation.  The type variable you\u2019ll select depends majorly on your motherboard \u2013 the port it has and also just how much area you can deal with.  Based upon information transmission you can have a SATA SSD or a NVME SSD. SATA, like the 2.5 inch type variable is older gen technology. NVME is a lot more current and also benchmark examinations claim an NVME SSD can send information at a price that\u2019s 10x faster than the fastest SATA SSD. So preferably if you desire an SSD for efficiency objectives you must be obtaining an NVME SSD.  Keep In Mind that a NVME SSD attaches to your computer by means of a M. 2 port; a SATA SSD attach by means of a SATA port; both can attach by means of a PCI port. Prior to deciding of which SSD kind to selected make certain that your computer has actually the needed port to sustain the link. The majority of Computers will certainly have a PCIe port anyhow, however validate (do not count on, as my crypto brothers will certainly claim).  A 500GB is excellent sufficient for pc gaming a COMPUTER. As long as you do not intend on setting up a lot of video games on your computer concurrently, it\u2019s ample to manage all your pc gaming requires.  The majority of video games generally assert around 30GB \u2013 40GB of storage area so with a 500GB SSD you mount a minimum of 8 video games at any type of one circumstances on your computer. 8 since, your computer\u2019s os and also a few other vital data will certainly consume some area also.  Naturally you can mount a lot more video games as soon as you\u2019re finished with and also uninstall an old video game. Yet offer or take, a 500GB SSD is greater than adequate for the ordinary players requires.  Extra is constantly (not constantly) much better, so if you have the cash money it makes good sense to select a 1TB SSD over a 512GB SSD. If you\u2019re nonetheless on a budget plan, you can go with a 512GB SSD. Read More: Sun Vs Star: Who Is Bigger?  Likewise if you\u2019re not intending on doing anything actually \u2018high efficiency\u2019 with your computer an excellent approach would certainly be to choose a 512GB SSD and also a 2TB or perhaps 3TB HDD as back up. You obtain a 512GB SSD to maintain your computer running efficiently and also quickly, and also The cost distinction in between a a 512GB SSD and also a 1TB SSD must suffice to cover for cost of the 2TB HDD. In this manner you obtain way a lot more storage space \u2013 which is what you\u2019ll require if you\u2019re not associated with any type of severe high efficiency computer.  Although 1TB is larger a 512GB SSD is a much better option than a 1TB HDD for a lot of factors. One is efficiency. SSDs are quicker and also in this day an age having an SSD onboard your computer system is sort of bare basics. Yet in addition to efficiency (which may not be leading concern for you), SSDs are a lot more long lasting and also power reliable than HDDS.  I have actually had a HDD with some extremely crucial docs collision on me prior to and also allow simply claim you do not desire that to occur to you. SSDs can last long durations, definitely a lot more longer than the ordinary HDD. They\u2019re a lot more immune to drops and also goes down and also extremely significantly need minimal power to run. They\u2019re additionally quieter also.  I recognize a 512GB SSD can work out to be more expensive than a 1TB HDD which is why we\u2019re having this conversation to begin with, but also for the benefits, in regards to efficiency, toughness and also power performance the previous supplies it\u2019s a no brainer actually.  If you have actually obtained a bargain for a 512GB vs 256GB + 1TB HDD configuration, the most effective alternative would certainly be the 256GB + 1TB configuration. I\u2019ll clarify why.  The 256GB SSd + 1TB HDD memory setup is preferred amongst budget plan kind laptops/PCs and also it makes much better feeling since you obtain the most effective of both globes on a budget plan \u2013 a smooth running computer thanks to the 256GB SSD and also a big adequate 1TB HDD for real storage space. With this configuration you can fill your os and also various other crucial data on the SSD and also limit every little thing else on the HDD.  Keep in mind nonetheless that this just uses if your configuration is the ordinary computer configuration. If you intend on doing some pc gaming or programs hefty training, you\u2019re much better off with the 512GB SSD config. Video gaming and also programs configuration data can consume considerable quantities of storage space, and also you require such data on your SSD for peak efficiency.  With a 256GB SSD you\u2019ll run out installment area quickly if you\u2019re a major player, which is why it makes good sense to select the 512GB alternative. Which\u2019s not counting the reality that you can conveniently obtain an exterior HDD to buffer up storage space if you require even more of it \u2013 it may be difficult (in some cases difficult) to mount a larger SSD onto your motherboard if you\u2019re utilizing a laptop computer.  The age long is a 512GB SSD sufficient for pc gaming inquiry is one many individuals ask. I make certain with this overview you currently recognize that it is without a doubt sufficient. You must additionally recognize now the distinctions in between the numerous types of SSDs and also which kind to go with depending upon your demands.

He was the Chief Minister\r\n                of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is a Member of Parliament from Varanasi. Modi is\r\n                a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh\r\n                (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. He is only the third Indian prime\r\n                minister to win two consecutive terms with a full majority in the Indian Parliament\r\n                and the second BJP prime minister after Atal Bihari Vajpayee. \n[2]\n\n[357]\n\n[358]\n\n \r\n                Born to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child\r\n                and has said he later ran his own stall. He was introduced to the RSS at the age\r\n                of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. Modi left home after\r\n                finishing high-school in part due to an arranged marriage to Jashodaben Chimanlal,\r\n                in which he stayed away from his wife and publicly acknowledged it only many decades\r\n                later. Modi travelled around India for two years and visited a number of religious\r\n                centres before returning to Gujarat. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the\r\n                RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was\r\n                forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several\r\n                positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.\r\n             \r\n                Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing\r\n                health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected\r\n                to the legislative assembly soon after. His policies as Chief Minister and corruption\r\n                free image, are credited for encouraging economic growth and have received praise.\r\n                He became the longest serving Chief Minister of Gujarat.\n[10]\n \n[359]\n\n \r\n                Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in\r\n                the Indian lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, which was the first time for\r\n                any single party since 1984. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy;\r\n                he has centralised power by abolishing the Planning Commission. He began a high-profile\r\n                sanitation campaign. To erradicate black money and counterfeit currency he initiated\r\n                demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes. He has demonstrated a tougher stance\r\n                against terrorism emnating from across the border as well as within India. Some\r\n                have criticised his government for weakening environmental and labour laws.\r\n             \r\n                Under his prime ministership the BJP went on to win the 2019 general election with\r\n                full majority and an even greater margin than in 2014. His government modifed article\r\n                370 of the Indian Constitution, a temporary article that granted special administrative\r\n                status to Jammu and Kashmir. His administration also introduced the Citizenship\r\n                Amendment Act. Some perceive his government has brought about a political realignment\r\n                towards the right-wing.\r\n             \r\n                Some of Modi's critics contend that his administration was slow to act in the 2002\r\n                Gujarat riots. A Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team found no evidence\r\n                to initiate prosecution against Modi. Some have criticised demonitization for being\r\n                ineffectual in curbing black money. These charges did not resonate with the Indian\r\n                electorate in the 2019 general election.\r\n             \r\n                Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a family of grocers in Vadnagar,\r\n                Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children\r\n                born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915\u20131989) and Hiraben Modi (born c. 1920).\r\n                \n[21]\nModi's family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community, \n[22]\n\n[23]\n\n[24]\nwhich is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government.\r\n                \n[25]\n\n[26]\n\n \r\n                As a child, Modi helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and\r\n                said that he later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus. [27] \r\n                Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher\r\n                described him as an average student and a keen debater, with interest in theatre.\r\n                \n[28]\nModi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and his teachers and students\r\n                noted this. \n\r\n                        [29]\r\n                    \nModi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical\r\n                productions, which has influenced his political image. \n[30]\n\n[31]\n\n \r\n                When eight years old, Modi discovered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and\r\n                began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao\r\n                Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior\r\n                cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor. \n[32]\nWhile Modi was training\r\n                with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana\r\n                Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980. [33] \n \r\n                Also in Narendra Modi's childhood, his family arranged a betrothal to a girl, Jashodaben\r\n                Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when they were teenagers. [34] \n\n[35]\nSometime thereafter he\n\r\n                        [36]\r\n                    \n left home, the couple going on to lead separate lives, neither\r\n                marrying again, and the marriage itself remaining unmentioned in Modi's public pronouncements\r\n                for many decades. \n\r\n                        [37]\r\n                    \nIn April 2014, shortly before the national elections that swept\r\n                him to power, Modi publicly affirmed that he was married and his spouse was Jashodaben;\r\n                the couple has remained married, but lived apart. \n[38]\n\n \r\n                Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India,\r\n                though few details of where he went have emerged. \n[39]\nIn interviews, Modi\r\n                has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math\r\n                near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission\r\n                in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each. \n[40]\n\n[41]\n\n[42]\nSwami Vivekananda\r\n                has been described as a key influence in Modi's life. \n[43]\n\n \r\n                In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after\r\n                which Modi wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri\r\n                and Guwahati. \n\r\n                        [44]\r\n                    \nModi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he\r\n                was again rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in\r\n                1968\u201369. \n\r\n                        [45]\r\n                    \nSometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar\r\n                for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad. \n[46]\nThere, Modi lived with\r\n                his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.\r\n                \n[47]\n\n[48]\n\n \r\n                In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar\r\n                Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city. \n\r\n                        [49]\r\n                    \n\n\r\n                        [50]\r\n                    \n\n\r\n                        [51]\r\n                    \nAfter the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working\r\n                for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS, [48] \r\n                working under Inamdar. \n\r\n                        [52]\r\n                    \nShortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest\r\n                against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has\r\n                been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him. \n[52]\nMany years later Modi\r\n                would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001. \n[53]\n\n \r\n                In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from School\r\n                of Open Learning \n\r\n                        [54]\r\n                    \nat University of Delhi, \n\r\n                        [55]\r\n                    \n\n\r\n                        [56]\r\n                    \ngraduating with a third class. \n[57]\nFive years\r\n                later, in 1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat\r\n                University, graduating with a first class \n\r\n                        [58]\r\n                    \n\n\r\n                        [59]\r\n                    \nas an external distance learning student. \n[60]\n\n \r\n                In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India\r\n                which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as \"The Emergency\", many of her\r\n                political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned. [61] \n\n[62]\nModi was appointed general secretary of the \"Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\",\r\n                an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards,\r\n                the RSS was banned. \n\r\n                        [63]\r\n                    \nModi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled\r\n                in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the\r\n                government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations. [64] \n\n[65]\nModi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals\r\n                wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.\r\n                \n[66]\nDuring this period, Modi wrote a book in Gujarati, Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In\r\n                The Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency. [67] \n\n[68]\nAmong the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist\r\n                George Fernandes, as well as several other national political figures. [69] \r\n                In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise,\r\n                once dressing as a monk, and once as a Sikh. \n[66]\n\n \r\n                Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS\r\n                activities in the areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the\r\n                RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS's version\r\n                of the history of the Emergency. \n\r\n                        [70]\r\n                    \nHe returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned\r\n                by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. \n\r\n                        [33]\r\n                    \nIn 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad\r\n                municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described\r\n                as the reason for that result by biographers. \n[71]\nAfter L. K. Advani became\r\n                president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important\r\n                positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection\r\n                for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit\r\n                later in 1987. \n\r\n                        [72]\r\n                    \n\n \r\n                Modi rose within the party and was named a member of the BJP's National Election\r\n                Committee in 1990, helping organise L. K. Advani's 1990 Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and\r\n                Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991\u201392 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity). \n[28]\n\n[73]\n\n[74]\nHowever, he\r\n                took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in Ahmedabad;\r\n                friction with Shankersingh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played\r\n                a part in this decision. \n\r\n                        [74]\r\n                    \nModi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence\r\n                of Advani, and as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered central\r\n                to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly elections. \n[74]\n\n[33]\n\n[75]\n\n[76]\nIn November\r\n                of that year Modi was elected BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi,\r\n                where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.\r\n                \n[75]\n\n[77]\nThe following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat,\r\n                defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary\r\n                seat in the Lok Sabha elections. \n\r\n                        [28]\r\n                    \nModi, on the selection committee for the 1998 Assembly elections\r\n                in Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting\r\n                Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as key\r\n                to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections, \n[75]\n\n[78]\nand Modi was promoted\r\n                to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year. \n[79]\n\n \r\n                In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly\r\n                seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration\r\n                were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling\r\n                of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001. \n\r\n                        [75]\r\n                    \n\n\r\n                        [80]\r\n                    \n\n\r\n                        [81]\r\n                    \nThe BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for\r\n                the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration,\r\n                was chosen as a replacement. \n\r\n                        [28]\r\n                    \nAlthough BJP leader L.

He asked the national government to\r\n                allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings.\r\n                \n[144]\nIn 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging.\r\n                In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a \"spiritual experience\" for Valmiks, a sub-caste\r\n                of Dalits. \n\r\n                        [145]\r\n                    \n\n\r\n                        [146]\r\n                    \nHowever, this book was not circulated that time because\r\n                of the election code of conduct. \n\r\n                        [147]\r\n                    \nAfter the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting\r\n                to discuss the security of Gujarat's 1,600-kilometre (990 mi)-long coastline, resulting\r\n                in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats.

His policies during his second term have been credited with\r\n                reducing corruption in the state.

Gujarat\r\n                expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated\r\n                from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled\r\n                irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended\r\n                when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised, \n[151]\naccording to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited\r\n                from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers. \n[157]\n\n \r\n                A contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat's economic development\r\n                during Modi's tenure as chief minister. \n\r\n                        [158]\r\n                    \nThe state's GDP growth rate averaged 10% during Modi's tenure,\r\n                a value similar to other highly industrialised states, and above that of the country\r\n                as a whole. \n\r\n                        [156]\r\n                    \nGujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s,\r\n                before Modi took office, and scholars have stated that growth did not accelerate\r\n                during Modi's tenure. \n\r\n                        [159]\r\n                    \nUnder Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank's \"ease of doing business\"\r\n                rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years. \n[160]\nIn 2013, Gujarat\r\n                was ranked first among Indian states for \"economic freedom\" by a report measuring\r\n                governance, growth, citizens' rights and labour and business regulation among the\r\n                country's 20 largest states. \n\r\n                        [156]\r\n                    \n\n\r\n                        [161]\r\n                    \nIn the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic\r\n                growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.\r\n                \n[3]\nTax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states,\r\n                as was land.

In 2013, Gujarat ranked\r\n                13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education. Nearly\r\n                45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished,\r\n                putting the state in the \"alarming\" category on the India State Hunger Index. \n[162]\n\n\r\n                        [163]\r\n                    \nA study by UNICEF and the Indian government found that Gujarat\r\n                under Modi had a poor record with respect to immunisation in children. [164] \n \r\n                Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative\r\n                to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining\r\n                near the median of the 29 Indian states. \n\r\n                        [102]\r\n                    \nIt showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality,\r\n                and its position with respect to individual consumption declined.

In\r\n                2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index. \n[7]\nUnder Modi, the state government spent far less than the national average\r\n                on education and healthcare. \n\r\n                        [102]\r\n                    \n\n \r\n                Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in\r\n                2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu\r\n                religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders.\r\n                During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by\r\n                Muslim leaders. \n\r\n                        [122]\r\n                    \nHe did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra. \n[122]\nHis campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation,\r\n                including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate\r\n                any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012. \n[122]\nDuring the 2012 campaign,\r\n                Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar\r\n                to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting\r\n                Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India. \n[122]\n\n \r\n                While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms\r\n                and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people, [120] \r\n                something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative\r\n                Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over\r\n                Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt. \n[165]\nThe BJP won 115 of\r\n                the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure \n[166]\nand allowing the\r\n                party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995). [167] \r\n                In later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats\r\n                held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates. [168] \r\n                In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University\r\n                of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests\r\n                by Indian-Americans. \n\r\n                        [169]\r\n                    \nAfter his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief\r\n                minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014.

[173] \n\n[177]\n\n[14]\nThe BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media.

[163] \r\n                In addition to more conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social\r\n                media, \n\r\n                        [158]\r\n                    \n\n\r\n                        [173]\r\n                    \nand addressed more than 1000 rallies via hologram appearances.\r\n                \n[14]\n\n \r\n                The BJP won 31% of the vote, \n\r\n                        [13]\r\n                    \nand more than doubled its tally in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming\r\n                the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984. [176] \n\n[177]\nVoter dissatisfaction with the INC, as well as with regional parties in North\r\n                India, was another reason for the success of the BJP, \n[177]\nas was the support\r\n                from the RSS. \n\r\n                        [173]\r\n                    \nIn states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well,\r\n                it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent\r\n                of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before. It performed particularly well\r\n                in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and\r\n                Muslims. \n\r\n                        [177]\r\n                    \nThe magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to\r\n                say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive\r\n                parties and towards the right-wing. \n\r\n                        [158]\r\n                    \n\n\r\n                        [177]\r\n                    \n\n\r\n                        [180]\r\n                    \n\n\r\n                        [181]\r\n                    \nModi's tweet announcing his victory was described\r\n                as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist\r\n                state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism. \n[182]\n\n \r\n                Modi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies: Varanasi and\r\n                Vadodara. \n\r\n                        [183]\r\n                    \nHe won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader\r\n                Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi and Madhusudan Mistry of the INC in Vadodara by 570,128\r\n                votes. \n\r\n                        [184]\r\n                    \nModi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, was appointed\r\n                prime minister by India's president. \n\r\n                        [185]\r\n                    \n\n\r\n                        [186]\r\n                    \nTo comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more\r\n                than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat. \n[187]\n\n \r\n                Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014.

This phone can easily beat a Snapdragon 730g and also helio g90t processor.. I use to play pubg mobile but unfortunately i get support of maximum Hd 30 fps but i used a gfx tool to test my mobile performance.. I set my graphics with HDR with 60 fps and i didn't believed that my phone almost gave me 60 fps for almost 2 hours then i faced many noticable frame drops with some frequent lags.. So I'll reccomend this processor. If you want to buy this processor for only official purpose then you can buy this without noticing anything else but if you have some gaming intention then I won't reccomend this because it is a old processor for gaming..

Employing this tech, Samsung brought its 64MP GW1 sensor sometime back. Although we have smaller and bigger megapixel producers in the market, for the sake of this article, we will be focussing on 64-megapixel shooters only. Now, high camera resolutions are naturally very easy to market, which is why manufacturers and marketers are zealously taking to these high megapixel counts to distinguish their products. So, before we get to the list of phones with a 64MP sensor, let\u2019s first understand the underlying technology that goes into these Quad Pixel sensors. Also Check: Best 48MP camera phones to buy\u00a0 That\u2019s not entirely wrong, but not exactly how things work in practice. The individual pixel size gets reduced and four of these are clubbed under one pixel of overlaying Bayer\u2019s filter (resulting in one bigger effective pixel). The overall size of the sensor is still significantly bigger than the usual 12MP or 16MP sensor, and that\u2019s a good thing. For instance, Samsung\u2019s 64MP GW1 sensor is 33% larger than its 48MP counterpart. As our experience with 48MP sensors has corroborated, these sensors haven\u2019t been designed for use at full resolution and the 64MP sensors will yield the best results at 16MP resolution. The improvement in image quality of midrange phones using such sensors is primarily because of the software smartly using these theoretical sub-pixels. In daylight, the software can group the four subpixels in two and shoot an image at different exposures from both halves and combine the capture into one image with a better dynamic range (similar to how HDR works). Some other 64MP sensor features include enhanced light sensitivity, dual conversion gain (DCG) that allows the sensor to adjust the light intake in a bright environment, high-performance Phase detection Autofocus, better color fidelity. Ever since Samsung kicked off the trend with the GW1, we have seen 64MP GW2 and GW3 from the South Korean brand, IMX686 & IMX682 from Sony, as well as OmniVision OV64A join the fray. These have already been employed by major Smartphone brands and we shall see some of the best ones down below.

Please try a different type of web browser. \n   \u00a0 Samsung Electronics, the world leader in advanced memory technology, today announced its development of the industry\u2019s first 512-gigabyte (GB) Compute Express Link (CXL) DRAM, taking an important step toward the commercialization of CXL which will enable extremely high memory capacity with low latency in IT systems. \u00a0 Since introducing the industry\u2019s first CXL DRAM prototype with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) controller in May 2021, Samsung has been working closely with data center, enterprise server and chipset companies to develop an improved, customizable CXL device. \u00a0  \u00a0 The new CXL DRAM is built with an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) CXL controller and is the first to pack 512GB of DDR5 DRAM, featuring four times the memory capacity and one-fifth the system latency over the previous Samsung CXL offering. \u00a0 \u201cCXL DRAM will become a critical turning point for future computing structures by substantially advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and big data services, as we aggressively expand its usage in next-generation memory architectures including software-defined memory (SDM),\u201d said Cheolmin Park, Vice President of Memory Global Sales & Marketing at Samsung Electronics, and Director of the CXL Consortium. \u201cSamsung will continue to collaborate across the industry to develop and standardize CXL memory solutions, while fostering an increasingly solid ecosystem.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cAs an active member of the CXL Consortium, Lenovo is committed to developing this important standard and helping build the ecosystem around the new CXL interconnect,\u201d said Greg Huff, Chief Technology Officer, Lenovo Infrastructure Solutions Group. \u201cWe are excited to be part of Samsung\u2019s CXL development program, working to foster the growth and adoption of innovative CXL products in future Lenovo systems.\u201d \u00a0  \u00a0 \u201cCXL is a key technology that enables more innovative ways to manage memory expansion and pooling which will play an important role in next-generation server platforms,\u201d said Christopher Cox, Vice President of Strategic Technology at Montage Technology. \u201cMontage is excited to continue partnering with Samsung to help the CXL ecosystem expand rapidly.\u201d \u00a0 In recent years, the growth of the metaverse, AI and big data has been generating explosive amounts of data. However, conventional DDR design limits the scaling of memory capacity beyond the tens of terabyte range, requiring an entirely new memory interface technology like CXL. \u00a0 The large pool of memory that is shared between CXL and main memory allows a server to expand its memory capacity to tens of terabytes, and at the same time increase its bandwidth to several terabytes per second. \u00a0 Samsung\u2019s 512GB CXL DRAM will be the first memory device that supports the PCIe 5.0 interface and will come in an EDSFF (E3.S) form factor\u00a0\u2014 especially suitable for next-generation high-capacity enterprise servers and data centers. \u00a0  \u00a0 Later this month, Samsung plans to unveil an updated version of its open-source Scalable Memory Development Kit (SMDK). The toolkit is a comprehensive software package that allows the CXL memory expander to work seamlessly in heterogeneous memory systems\u00a0\u2014 enabling system developers to incorporate CXL memory into various IT systems running AI, big data and cloud applications, without having to modify existing application environments. \u00a0 Samsung will begin sampling its 512GB CXL DRAM with customers and partners for joint evaluation and testing in the third quarter of this year, and plans to have the memory ready for commercialization as next-generation server platforms become available. As a member of the CXL Consortium Board of Directors, Samsung is openly collaborating with many global data center, server and chipset\u00a0vendors to deliver next-generation interface technologies that can bring highly tangible benefits to the IT industry.

Humayun's tomb (Maqbara e Humayun) is the tomb of the Mughal Emperor Humayun in Delhi, India. The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress Bega Begum (also known as Haji Begum), in 1569-70, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas, a Persian architect chosen by her. It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent, and is located in Nizamuddin East, Delhi, India, close to the Dina-panah Citadel, also known as Purana Qila (Old Fort), that Humayun founded in 1533. It was also the first structure to use red sandstone at such a scale.

Though he later said that it was purely unintentional and he stopped walking off when he realized that the anthem was still being played.\n\n\u2022 In 2016, he gave a controversial statement when he humorously urged the college girls to stop using \"fancy clothes and lipstick\" in education institutes, as he thought institutes are not meant for \"beauty contests.\"\n\u2022 In May 2018, when Karnataka headed for a hung assembly after the results of the Karnataka assembly election, Congress and the JD(S) came together to form a coalition government. But Governor Vala invited BJP first to form the government, as they came out to be the single-largest party with 104 seats, and gave BJP 15 days to prove its majority on the floor of the assembly. The decision of the Governor to invite the BJP first was criticized by the Congress and JD(S) who called it biased and not fair. Governor's decision was challenged by the Congress in the midnight of 16 May, after they approached the Supreme Court seeking an immediate intervention by the Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra to stop B.S. Yeddyurappa's swearing-in scheduled on 17 May, to which the Supreme Court denied. \n\n\nGirls, Affairs and More\n\n\nMarital StatusMarried \n\n\nFamily\n\n\nWife/SpouseManoramabahen \n\n\nChildrenSons- 2\nDaughters- 2\n\n\nParentsFather- Rudabhai Vala\nMother- Name Not Known\n\n\nFavourite Things\n\n\nFavourite Politician(s)Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Narendra Modi\n\n\nMoney Factor\n\n\n\nSalary (approx.)\u20b93.5 lakh/month + Other allowances (as in 2018)\n\n\nNet Worth (approx.)\u20b960 lakh (as in 2018)\n\n\n\n   \nFollow us on our social media channels to stay connected.

Few years ago, we couldn\u2019t even think of having unicorns in India. The Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister first mentioned his vision of Startup India and Stand Up India in 2016, and I want to congratulate Gujarat University on being the first to grab the opportunity and taking the responsibility to enable young Indians to start up and is on its way to becoming a model university. \u201cPrior to 2014, entrepreneurship was merely an exception rather than a rule or a norm. There has never been a more opportune moment for young Indians to succeed than now. Innovation, innovation and innovation is the mantra going forward. Innovation is going to drive our future.The government is making efforts to connect startups with its ecosystem so that government's procurement requirements can be met with innovative solutions by startups,\" Universities can go a long way in making Forensic Science popular among students. I\u2019m incredibly appreciative of the fact that Gujarat University for organising this Forensic Science Conference, and hope that this will establish the way forward to founding a Forensic Council in the time to come. I\u2019m grateful to Gujarat University for nurturing alumni like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. There is always an inevitable need for University and Industry to work together, but what Gujarat University is doing is far, far more important. The University is not just creating linkages and collaborating with businesses of today but creating tomorrow\u2019s businesses at the University itself! I really look forward to having Gujarat University\u2019s guidance on what and how we should take this idea forward nationally. It is hard to find that a single university has produced pioneering stakeholders in multiple fields and helped them reach the zenith of success. Gujarat University has single-handedly groomed the likes of the country\u2019s Prime Minister besides Chief Justices and notable scientists.\r\n \r\n It makes me happy to be in the place of birth and the original battleground of the Father of the Nation. But what makes me happier still, is being amongst the young students of this University, one of whom carved his journey to being the Prime Minister of the country, setting high standards of self-reliance and national consciousness for every student. I\u2019m happy to see that 13 out of 21 medals at today\u2019s Convocation ceremony are being won by girl students. It is noteworthy that 85 per cent of students at Gujarat University are from other states and union territories, making the University campus a mini-India and strengthening our national unity. It is nothing but a sign of an evolving nation that Prime Ministers today aren\u2019t Cambridge and Oxford graduates, but alumni of Gujarat University.

But due to a certain Reliance Jio, now the term 4G VoLTE overtook everything else. However, only a few tech enthusiasts actually know about the 4G VoLTE technology. So we must try to clear your confusions regarding 4G LTE and 4G VoLTE, the key differentiators and which one you should pick. Also Read: How To Reset Gmail Password? 4G is the fourth generation of data technology for mobile networks. LTE stands for Long Term Evolution. Combined, 4G LTE data technology helps cellular network providers to offer high-speed data for every 4G supported device. In fact, a 4G Internet is actually 4 to 5x faster than 3G tech. It is, however, only a data-based protocol. Through LTE, you\u2019ll only be able to surf the web i.e. \u2013 use data. So, every other service like voice calls, SMS messages will actually not be served through the LTE network (they use 2G/3G technologies instead). This means your device will fall back to a 3G and 2G network whenever you do any such activities. Also Read: How To View Saved WiFi Password In Your Android Device VoLTE actually stands for Voice Over LTE. What it means is that unlike in 4G LTE, even calls, SMS and web browsing will be served only through data channels. You\u2019ll be using your Internet data plan to make calls, send SMS or browse the web altogether. There are several reasons why using the latest VoLTE technology over the LTE is beneficial. Below are a few popular reasons. Currently, Jio is the only carrier with a PAN India license for using the 2300 MHz spectrum. Also Read: IPL Schedule 2022: How To Watch IPL Online? With 4G LTE, you can use data to surf the web, use apps that require an Internet connection etc. All the calls and SMS services will be carried through either 2G or the 3G network. Fortunately, in the case of VoLTE or Voice Over LTE, as the name suggests, all services like browsing, voice calls, SMS etc. will be handled through the data/Internet. This also enables you to make HD voice calls over the web (similar to WhatsApp voice calling, which makes calls over the IP network).

VoLTE is an improved, more refined version of 4G LTE. The disadvantage with 4G LTE is that when you\u2019re travelling to remote places, you will not be able to make calls since there will be no 2G/3G network to fall back to. But this is highly unlikely \u2013 regions across the world are more likely to have 2G/3G networks than 4G. If you\u2019re upgrading to a new phone, make sure it has 4G VoLTE support. In the current scenario, Reliance Jio is the only cellular provider that is offering the 4G VoLTE services in India. All of the rest of the big players like Airtel, Idea, BSNL etc. are readying themselves to convert to the new technology in the coming days. Also Read: How to Troubleshoot No Audio on Your Laptop?

There are many possible answers you can get, it depends on your hardware usage and your budget. I will discuss all you need to know about 512GB SSD to help you figure out for yourself whether it is enough for you or not. What is an SSD? SSD stands for a solid-state drive. It\u2019s a type of computer storage that holds data on flash memory chips. Solid-state drives use flash memory to store data in solid-state chips instead of on spinning disks. SSDs have no moving parts, which means they\u2019re more resistant to damage from drops and other physical trauma, and they\u2019re also faster than traditional hard drives because there\u2019s no need for physical movement of the read/write head when accessing data. What is 512GB? A gigabyte (GB) is a unit of digital information, usually expressed as 1,000,000 bytes. A megabyte (MB) is a million bytes, or 10^6 = 1,000,000. A kilobyte (KB) is 1,024 bytes. A terabyte (TB) is 1,024 gigabytes. A petabyte (PB) is 1,024 terabytes. A petabyte is about one quadrillion bytes. You may have heard the term \u201cgig,\u201d which refers to a single gigabyte of data or to electronic equipment that operates at one billion Hz per second or faster. For example, if you\u2019re using an 802.11g wireless network device that operates at 54 Mbps (megabits per second), then it can transmit data at 54 Mbps/1 Gbps = 54,000 kilobits per second (Kbps). The average photo these days is about 4MB in size, which means that 512GB can hold around 250,000 photos. If they are all 4MB and they\u2019re all just sitting there doing nothing, then yes you should be fine to store that many photos on your 512GB SSD. However, if you keep all your photos on your computer and use it as a backup device for your photos as well as other important data (like work documents), then it\u2019s likely that you won\u2019t be able to store 250K+ photos since most people will want their computer to also perform other tasks like browsing the internet or watching videos, etc. The average song is about 4MB in size. The average album is about 10-12 songs, so for the sake of simplicity, we will assume that an album is about 12 songs. That means that 512GB can hold about 125,000 songs! A video file is made up of many parts, some of which can be compressed more easily than others. A typical video file has about 200MB for the actual video and another 1000-2000MB for audio. There are also some other small bits that don\u2019t compress easily, such as thumbnails and metadata. So, if we assume an average compression ratio of 3x (which is a very conservative estimate), then 1GB of space can hold 800MB of data. If you have a 512GB SSD, this means that you can fit 80 hours\u2019 worth of 1080p video onto it. For 4K UHD (3840\u00d72160) video, that drops to just 48 hours worth. A good estimate of the storage capacity required for an operating system and non-gaming programs is 50GB. A typical game requires 20GB of storage space. In total, your gaming computer should have 22GB of storage space available (not counting the SSD, which should be advertised as 500GB rather than 512GB in order to avoid confusion). The main reason why SSDs are worth the investment is their durability and reliability. Compared to hard disk drives, solid-state drives have no moving parts, which means they\u2019re much less likely to fail over time. In fact, solid-state drives are so reliable that they\u2019re used in servers and other high-end applications where uptime is paramount. SSDs use NAND flash memory to store data. This makes them faster than hard disk drives, which rely on mechanical parts like spinning platters and reading heads to find and retrieve data. SSDs offer much faster load times in a wide variety of applications compared to HDDs. In fact, they can be up to 20 times faster in loading programs, opening large documents, or booting up your computer. A 512GB SSD also generates less heat than its hard drive counterpart, which can improve the overall lifespan of your computer. You won\u2019t need to worry about the extra heat damaging other components in your computer either, such as your CPU or graphics card. SSDs are generally smaller than traditional HDDs. This means that you can save space and use the extra space for other things, such as adding more memory or upgrading your graphics card. A 512GB SSD uses less power than a 250GB HDD. This is because SSDs don\u2019t have mechanical parts that spin up and down, and they use less power to transfer data. The amount of power used by an SSD depends on the amount of data being accessed as well as the type of flash memory used in the drive. The newer 3D NAND technology has been optimized for lower power consumption. The biggest disadvantage of a 512GB SSD is the price. The larger the drive, the more expensive it\u2019s likely to be per gigabyte. So if you\u2019re looking for an SSD with a large capacity, you may need to invest in a more expensive drive. A 512GB SSD will typically cost about twice as much as a 256GB model If any of the controller chip, memory cache, or NAND type memory chips are physically damaged, you may be unable to recover your data. This can happen if you drop your computer or if something gets spilled on it (which can happen if your laptop gets knocked over). In addition, SSDs don\u2019t have as much built-in error correction code as traditional hard drives do \u2014 so if there\u2019s an error in one spot on an SSD then it may affect all of the data stored in that area of memory. When you have so much space to work with, you will anticipate that the 512GB SSD is large enough for most workloads today. I am sure that will be true to some extent but if your day-to-day usage does not revolve around multimedia editing or gaming then the 256GB model should suffice for your needs. FAQ, S To put it simply, yes. The average consumer would probably be content with the 256GB. But anyone with a large media library has likely looked towards upgrading to the 512GB of whatever laptop they are using. For those who love their music, movies, and any other forms of media, it\u2019s safe to say that 512GB is going to be enough space for all your data. The answer to this question depends on what you want to do with the laptop. If you are a student who wants to use the laptop for doing simple things like writing documents, surfing the internet, gaming, and watching videos then 512GB SSD is good enough for you. But if you are going to use your laptop for some heavy tasks like video editing and gaming then you should go for at least 1TB of storage space. No. While it\u2019s true that a lot depends on the type of work being done, and how much time is willing spent on transferring multiple files between drives, the reality is that 512 GB solid-state drives are more than enough for any kind of professional or even hobbyist operation. But In the end, it depends. If you are running a lot of apps day-to-day, then stick with the 256 GB SSD. Anything more is just overkill. If you have a lot of photo/video editing to do or for professional uses, then going up to 512 GB might be better. The 1 TB SSD will be good for intensive graphic work like 3D rendering and video encoding provided that you have the hardware to support it. the answer really depends on your workflow. If you are someone who edits thousands of photos every week like a professional photographer or you have hundreds of thousands of images on your hard drive, then maybe 512GB isn\u2019t enough. On the other hand, if you\u2019re only editing a handful of photos per week or month, and you don\u2019t have many files on the computer anyway, then 512GB will likely be plenty. Plus, in general, SSDs are just getting bigger and bigger. So it\u2019s possible that even 512GB won\u2019t be enough in another year or two. The bottom line is that a 512GB SSD is certainly good for gaming in the right system, but it\u2019s not necessarily what every gamer should be picking up. Ultimately, you have to look beyond pure storage space and consider the performance of your entire system and if any other bottlenecks may be coming into play. We hope this guide will help you to decide whether a 512GB SSD is right for your gaming needs or not. While 512GB is more than enough space for working with smaller projects and files, this amount of storage would fill up quite quickly when working on 4K or higher resolution projects. When in doubt, always make sure to have extra storage for when you need it, but in my experience, a 512GB SSD is a great starting point for any video editor who isn\u2019t trying to cut major storage costs. Your 512GB SSD drive will show less usable space than it has due to the fact that computers like to show you \u2018decimal\u2019 numbers (1.5, .45, etc.) rather than \u2018binary\u2019 numbers (1.111111, .101010, etc).

In a nutshell it stands for \"fourth-generation\" and the European Commission (EC) says it should be able to download a one-hour movie in six minutes.  But there are no national or international standards for mobile data speeds. 1G, or the first generation of mobile data, was introduced in 1991.  As was 2G, but it was 1G's digital brother. It was analogue and the phones looked a bit like this... Known as an SMS, 2G made it possible to send text messages between friends.  There were also picture messages called MMS (multimedia messaging service) brought in with 2G. And also GSM, GPRS, EDGE on mobile phones like this one.  3G and its 2mbit/s (or 0.25 megabytes per second) data came in at around the time the first wave of smartphones arrived in shops. It's not that fast but it gave wireless access to internet which was the first step - and it made video calling possible. To give you an idea of quite how slow it is as standard, if you wanted David Brent: Life on the Road from iTunes it will supposedly take more than five hours to download the 4.26GB file. And the faster speeds meant that mobile gaming was brought to a whole new level.  The same film that would have taken you more than five hours to download on 3G supposedly takes less than 8 minutes on 4G. But 4G isn't available everywhere yet, some parts of the UK don't even have 2G let alone 3G or 4G.  Well the EC predicts that will be around sometime between 2020 and 2030 and will let you download a one hour HD movie in six seconds.  Who knows what phones will look like then?

The details were shared by Gujarat University after the CIC directed it to provide the information to Kejriwal. Delhi University has also been asked to share \u201cinformation regarding degrees in the name of Mr Narendra Damodardas Modi in the year 1978\u201d. Speaking to The Indian Express, the V-C noted that Modi had scored 499 out of total 800 in MA (237 out of 400 in first year, and 262 out of 400 in second year). The PTI quoted the V-C as saying that the PM had obtained 64 marks in political science, 62 marks in European and social political thoughts, 69 marks in modern India/political analysis, and 67 marks in political psychology in his second year MA exam. When asked for a copy of the marksheet, Patel said: \u201cI can\u2019t provide copies of the marksheet to mediapersons or a third party. It can be given only to the candidate\u2026 Moreover, the university is not bound to provide any information about something that happened more than 30 years ago.\u2019\u2019 Patel said he has not received any order of the CIC till now, but added that \u201cI can give copies to the media if I am directed so by the PMO or the CIC\u2019\u2019. [related-post] He said that six months ago, he had sent details of Modi\u2019s qualification to one Hiren Joshi in the PMO via WhatsApp. \u201cAt that time also, I did not send copy of the marksheet to the PMO because the PMO did not ask for it.\u2019\u2019\u00a0\u201cOur records show that Modi had collected the postgraduate certificate,\u2019\u2019 the V-C said. Modi\u2019s name is among the illustrious alumni on the varsity\u2019s website. While contesting the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi had declared that he has a BA degree from Delhi University and a Master\u2019s from Gujarat University.\u00a0The Congress, however, slammed the university for its stance that educational qualification details of a student could be disclosed only to the student concerned. \u201cAfter the CIC asked Gujarat University to give reply, overnight it turned vibrant, progressive, and instead of calling it secret, it decided to give information along with marks.

Your Cart is Empty View Cart  Aperture refers to the opening of a lens's diaphragm through which\u00a0light passes. It is calibrated in f/stops and\u00a0is generally written as numbers such as 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11 and 16. Lower f/stops give more exposure because they represent the larger apertures, while the higher f/stops give less exposure because they represent\u00a0smaller apertures.\u00a0This may seem a little contradictory at first but will become clearer as you take pictures at varying f/stops. Be sure to check your manual first to learn how to set Aperture Priority for your camera, then try experimenting to get comfortable with changing the aperture and recognizing the effects different apertures will have on the end-result image. \u00a0 Depth of field is the zone of acceptable sharpness in front of and behind the subject on which the lens is focused. Simply put: how sharp or blurry is the area behind your subject.  The lower the f/stop\u2014the larger the opening in the lens\u2014the less depth of field\u2014the blurrier the background. The higher the f/stop\u2014the smaller the opening in the lens\u2014the greater the depth of field\u2014the sharper the background. All lenses have a maximum aperture, and all NIKKOR lenses list the widest possible aperture on the lens barrel. Some zoom lenses will detail something like f/3.5-5.6 on the lens barrel or 1:3.5-5.6 (below right). These numbers, the 3.5 and the 5.6, are referring to the maximum aperture or widest opening the lens can achieve for each end of the zoom range. Some higher end lenses can maintain the largest aperture throughout the entire zoom range, so only one number is detailed (below left). Now that we know how to control depth of field, what determines the choices we make in selecting the aperture?\u00a0We use focus and depth of field to direct attention to what is important in the photograph, and we use lack of focus to minimize distractions that cannot be eliminated from the composition.\u00a0While there are no rules, there are some guidelines for selecting Aperture priority. For\u00a0classic portraiture we separate our subject from the surroundings by using\u00a0\"selective focus.\"\u00a0Choosing a large aperture (lower f/stop, like f2.8) creates very shallow depth of field with only the subject, or just a portion of the subject, in focus. This helps direct the viewer's attention to the subject. When choosing lenses for\u00a0landscape photography, we usually want to see as much detail as possible from foreground to background; we want to achieve the\u00a0maximum depth of field by choosing a small aperture (higher f/stop, like f/8 or f/11). While we can get the maximum or minimum depth of field by working at each end of the aperture range, sometimes we want a more intermediate level of depth of field, limiting focus to a specific range of distances within the overall photograph.\u00a0One way to do this is to\u00a0choose a mid-range f/stop, like f/5.6,\u00a0and shoot a test frame.\u00a0In image playback, use the magnifying function of the LCD to zoom in and check the depth of field; make adjustments if necessary and reshoot.

Just like its predecessor, the 712 has been built on a 10 nm process, though the CPU clock speed has been increased from 2.2GHz to 2.3GHz, improving overall performance by 10 per cent. Qualcomm Snapdragon 700-series was introduced with Snapdragon 710. The mobile platform is aimed at mid-range premium Android phones. We have seen the 710 chip being used in mid-range smartphones like Nokia 8.1, Lenovo Z5s, Oppo R17 Pro. Qualcomm 712 is a slight improvement over the previous-generation chip. Similar to Snapdragon 710, it includes support for\u00a0Qualcomm\u2019s QuickCharge 4+ technology, claimed to charge a phone from 0 per cent to 50 per cent in 15 minutes. The graphics rendering and 4K HDR playback capabilities have been increased by 10 per cent for an improved audio and visual gaming experience. Expect better battery usage management and auto-adjust settings for pictures. Another feature is it will let users shoot 4K Ultra HD videos, which helps reduce battery drain. Qualcomm\u00a0Snapdragon 712 comes with a Snapdragon X15 LTE modem, a Category 15 LTE modem that supports up to 800 Mbps download speeds.\u00a0It is unclear at this point in time, which phones will have this mobile platform.

Comment savoir si tel ou tel t\u00e9l\u00e9phone (smartphone) va bien capter sur tel ou tel r\u00e9seau (Bouygues, Free, Orange, Altice - SFR)\u00a0? J\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de me cr\u00e9er un petit tableau (enfin plusieurs) que j\u2019esp\u00e8re bien pratique pour choisir son smartphone. Cet article est une simple vulgarisation pour s\u2019y retrouver facilement. Tout d\u2019abord, il existe plusieurs normes\u00a0de 4G (LTE), en France les op\u00e9rateurs utilisent la FDD.

Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le smartphone ait toutes les fr\u00e9quences. Si vous \u00eates chez Orange privil\u00e9giez la B20 qui repr\u00e9sente le gros des antennes, chez Free la B3, chez Bouygues la B20 et B3, chez Altice (SFR) la B20 et B3. Une autre fa\u00e7on de lire le tableau \n\n  Mais ce n\u2019est pas tout. Suivant les op\u00e9rateurs, il faudra privil\u00e9gier telle ou telle bande (voir tableau ci-dessous, plus c\u2019est vert mieux c\u2019est\u00a0:D ).

It\u2019s half a dozen or more gadgets packed into a single slab, and many of its coolest feats are accomplished with a wide range of sensors\u2014but what are they and what do they all actually do? How does your phone count your steps and replace your fitness tracker? Does GPS use up your data? Which sensors should you make sure are in your next handset? Here\u2019s all you need to know. Accelerometers handle axis-based motion sensing and can be found in fitness trackers as well as phones\u2014they\u2019re the reason why your smartphone can track your steps even if you haven\u2019t bought a separate wearable. They also tell the phone\u2019s software which way the handset is pointing, something that\u2019s becoming increasingly important with the arrival of augmented reality apps. Kick back and unwind with an audiobook.Unwind with 12 credits to spend on any audiobook, and free access to the Premium Plus selections, no credits needed.  As the name kind of gives away, accelerometers measure acceleration. That means the map inside Snapchat can put a cute toy car around your bitmoji when you\u2019re driving, and a host of other actually useful applications can be enabled too. The sensor is itself made up of other sensors, including microscopic crystal structures that become stressed due to accelerative forces. The accelerometer then interprets the voltage coming from the crystals to figure out how fast your phone is moving and which direction it\u2019s pointing in. From switching apps from portrait to landscape, to showing your current speed in a driving app, the accelerometer is one of your phone\u2019s most important sensors. The gyroscope helps the accelerometer out with understanding which way your phone is orientated\u2014 it adds another level of precision so those 360-degree photospheres really look as impressive as possible. Whenever you play a racing game on your phone and tilt the screen to steer, the gyroscope rather than the accelerometer is sensing what you\u2019re doing, because you\u2019re only applying small turns to the phone and not actually moving through space. Gyroscopes aren\u2019t exclusive to phones: They\u2019re used in altimeters inside aircraft to determine altitude and position, for example, and to keep cameras steady on the move. Better ones are in the pipeline, though they won\u2019t immediately be cheap and practical enough for consumer mobile devices. The gyroscopes inside smartphones don\u2019t use wheels and gimbals like the traditional mechanical ones you might find in an old plane\u2014instead, they\u2019re MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) gyroscopes. The first time MEMS gyroscopes really hit it big was with the iPhone 4 in 2010. Back then, it was incredibly novel to have a phone that could detect orientation with such accuracy\u2014nowadays, we take it for granted. Completing the triumvirate of sensors responsible for working out where a phone is in physical space is the magnetometer. Again the name gives it away\u2014it measures magnetic fields and can thus tell you which way is north by varying its voltage output to the phone. When you go in and out of compass mode in Apple Maps or Google Maps, that\u2019s the magnetometer kicking in to work out which way up the map should be. It also powers standalone compass apps. Magnetometers are found in metal detectors as well, as they can detect magnetic metals, which is why you can get metal detector apps for your smartphone. However, the sensor doesn\u2019t work alone for its primary purpose, which is inside mapping apps\u2014it operates in tandem with the data coming from the phone\u2019s accelerometer and GPS unit to figure out whereabouts you are in the world, and which way you\u2019re pointing (very handy for those detailed navigation routes). Ah, GPS\u2014Global Positioning System technology\u2014where would we be without you? Probably in a remote, muddy field, cursing the day we ditched our paper maps for the electronic equivalents. GPS units inside phones get a ping from a satellite up in space to figure out which part of the planet you\u2019re standing on (or driving through). They don\u2019t actually use any of your phone\u2019s data, which is why you can still see your location when your phone has lost signal, even if the map tiles themselves are a blurry, low-res mess. In fact, it connects with multiple satellites then calculates where you are based on the angles of intersection. If no satellites can be found\u2014you\u2019re indoors or the cloud cover is heavy\u2014then you won\u2019t be able to get a lock. And while GPS doesn\u2019t use up data, all this communicating and calculating can be a drain on your battery, which is why most battery-saving guides recommend switching GPS off. Smaller gadgets like some smartwatches don\u2019t include it for the same reason. GPS isn\u2019t the only way your phone can work out where it is\u2014distance to cell towers can also be used as a rough approximation, as Serial taught us\u2014but if you\u2019ve got some serious navigating to do then it\u2019s essential. Modern-day GPS units inside smartphones actually combine GPS signals with other data, like cell signal strength, to get more accurate location readings. Just about every phone on the market will come with either a fingerprint sensor or a facial recognition system to help you log into your phone. These biometric sensors can be tricked in certain ways, but they\u2019re generally more secure\u2014and a lot more convenient\u2014than using a PIN code or a pattern alone. Fingerprint sensors have made the move from hardware buttons to in-screen circuitry. There are three main types: Optical (scanning with light), capacitive (scanning with electronic capacitors), and ultrasonic (scanning with sound waves). For the best results, you want ultrasonic, though the other two options are sometimes used on phones towards the cheaper end of the market. These sensors aren\u2019t working alone, with manufacturers deploying a variety of different software tricks and algorithms to make the fingerprint recognition as accurate as possible. The best premium Android phones now have in-display fingerprint sensors that are almost as good as the ones using physical hardware buttons. Apple is rolling out facial recognition to unlock its new iPhone X, as has been rumored for months\u2026 You won\u2019t find a fingerprint sensor on the top-tier iPhones or the Pixel 4, of course: These phones, and others like them, use facial recognition. Again, a variety of technologies are deployed here, with cheaper handsets simply using a normal camera lens and trying to verify your identity with a high-resolution photo. At the high-end, an infrared sensor maps your face in three dimensions using dots, which are then interpreted by software on the phone: The smarter the software, the quicker the unlock. When face unlock works well, it can feel like magic, but there\u2019s a lot of work going on behind the scenes. You\u2019ve got plenty more sensors in your handset, though they\u2019re perhaps not all as important as the ones we\u2019ve already mentioned. The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are unique in having a Soli sensor, which is essentially a radar module: It can detect movement near the phone and just above it, so alarms get quieter as you move to mute them, and face unlock can kick into action as soon as you pick up your phone. On the Apple side, we\u2019ve seen LiDAR added to the iPad Pros, and it may well come to the iPhone soon. In short, it\u2019s a laser light scanning technology that can judge depth and map out a room very accurately, and it\u2019s going to be most useful for augmented reality apps in the years to come. Then there\u2019s the U1 chip in the newest Apple phones. This is more of a communications antenna than a sensor, but it can help determine location and the direction you\u2019re pointing your phone in. Many phones, including the iPhone, also have a barometer that measures air pressure: it\u2019s useful for everything from detecting weather changes to calculating the altitude you\u2019re at. The proximity sensor usually sits up near the top speaker and combines an infrared LED and light detector to work out when you have the phone up to your ear, so that screen can be switched off. The sensor emits a beam of light that gets bounced back, though it\u2019s invisible to the human eye. Meanwhile, the ambient light sensor does exactly what you would expect, taking a measuring of the light in the room and adjusting your screen\u2019s brightness accordingly (if indeed it\u2019s set to auto-adjust). Like the rest of the tech packed inside your handset, these sensors are getting smaller, smarter, and less power-hungry all the time, so just because phones five years apart both have GPS doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re both going to be as accurate. Add in software tweaks and optimizations too and it\u2019s more reason to upgrade your handset on a regular basis, even if you\u2019ll almost never see these sensors listed on a specs sheet.

If you are a camera enthusiast and you want to be able to tell a killer camera by just looking at the specs, I\u2019ll advice that you read up on the earlier two posts (click here for part 1 and here for part 2) that I have made on the subject. If you already have, then that\u2019s great. Let\u2019s proceed.  MAIN CAMERA\nQuad 48 MP, f/1.8, 26mm (wide), 1/2.0\u2033, 0.8\u00b5m, PDAF\n8 MP, f/2.2, 13mm (ultrawide), 1/4.0\u2033, 1.12\u00b5m\n2 MP, f/2.4, (macro)\n2 MP, f/2.4, (depth)  (Redmi Note 8 quad camera specs) Every smartphone should have the following specifications: i. The number of sensors\nii. Megapixel (MP) rating\niii. Aperture size (F/ number)\niv. Focal length of lens (mm)\nv. Sensor size (1/x.x\u201d)\nvi. Pixel size (\u00b5m)  So when you check the spec sheet of the camera of any phone, it should tell you first and foremost the number of cameras it has. If it reads single, it means that it has only one camera, dual means two cameras and quad means four cameras. Some phones like the Mi Note 10 and the Mi 10 have penta (five) cameras which is the same as the Nokia Pure view.  The next thing to look out for is the number of pixels in the sensor. This is rated in megapixels. A large number of pixels helps to boost the image resolution especially when you zoom in. Cameras these days boast a lot of pixels, some going as high as 100MP. Most of these numbers are for marketing so do not be overly swayed by them. A lot of 16MP cameras in the market give out 8MP photo output, some 48MP give out 12MP photo output as well. Samsung\u2019s new 64MP cameras give out a 16MP output while the 108MP used by Xiaomi outputs at 27MP quality. These are all as a result of pixel binning which I will explain in my next post. The aperture size (F/x) is the size of the opening into the camera. The standard size used is usually F/2.0. The main camera usually has the widest opening. The wider the opening, the more light will enter into the camera and this will lead to better pictures. The only trade off here is that you\u2019ll have to sacrifice depth of field.  The focal length of the lens will tell you how wide the angle of view of the cameras are. It is measured in millimeters. A high focal length like 40mm means that the lens used in the camera is thick but the angle of view would be smaller than a thinner lens of 20mm which would have a much wider angle of view. The sensor size is measured in fractions of an inch. The sensor size of the main camera of the Redmi Note 8 above is 1/2.0\u201d (0.5\u2033) which is a fairly good size. The average size used is 1/2.55\u201d. The biggest sensor in use today is the 1/1.28 (0.78\u2033) (Huawei P40) while the smallest is 1/5.0\u201d (0.2\u2033). A big or well sized sensor means that a good amount of pixels can be packed into the sensor which will help it catch light better and produce great photos.  Finally, you have pixel sizes. These are measured in micrometers or microns (\u00b5m). The average size used today is 0.8\u00b5m while the largest in use is around 2.4\u00b5m. In summary, bigger pixels are always better than small pixels. This is because bigger pixels catch more light and produce brighter, clearer and noiseless photos. They also perform better at night or in low light. Smaller pixels do not catch light as well as big pixelsap so their performance do not meet up with those of the bigger pixels. In other to combat these problems of small pixels, manufacturers now combine four small pixels to produce a larger \u201csuper pixel\u201d to catch light better using a method called pixel binning. The Redmi Note 8 featured here combines four 0.8\u00b5m to try to achieve the light sensitivity of a 1.6\u00b5m sized pixel. MAIN CAMERA\nQuad 48 MP, f/1.8, 26mm (wide), 1/2.0\u2033, 0.8\u00b5m, PDAF\n8 MP, f/2.2, 13mm (ultrawide), 1/4.0\u2033, 1.12\u00b5m\n2 MP, f/2.4, (macro)\n2 MP, f/2.4, (depth)  (Redmi Note 8 quad camera specs) Here we can see that the main sensor has a resolution of 48MP, a very wide aperture at f/1.8, a wide angle of view because of that 26mm focal length lens, a well sized sensor at 1/2.0\u201d and small pixels at 0.8\u00b5m although it uses pixel binning to combine 4 pixels to catch light better. This means that 48MP divided by 4 equals 12MP. It also has PDAF or simply Auto focus. The second camera there has only an 8MP resolution. This is understandable because it is a supporting camera. It produces a really wide angle of view due to it\u2019s really thin focal length of 13mm. The aperture is smaller than the main camera at f/2.2 but it is still wide enough to catch light effectively. The hardware specs vary with different cameras. A main camera does most of the work and should have the highest resolution (MP rating), a wide aperture, a big sensor size, big pixels as well as focal length that would give it a wide angle. Telephoto cameras have smaller apertures and longer focal lengths with an increased depth of field while Ultra wide cameras have wide apertures and very small focal lengths which give them a very wide field of view. It is important to know who designed the camera. The best manufacturers around are Sony and Samsung. Their cameras cost a pretty penny too. Others are Omnivision, Toshiba, SK Hynix, LG and HTC. So that\u2019s it on how to read smartphone camera specs. Coming next are filters and pixel binning. Hope you had a great time? Hit me up in the comments.

New Delhi: Gujarat governor Vajubhai Vala has given BS Yeddyurappa 15 days to prove his majority on the floor of the House and this has led to both the Congress and the JD(S) crying foul. But there is a sub-plot.   \r In 1996, Gujarat BJP Government was dismissed by the President on the advice of the PM. Vaghela split the BJP to form government with backing of Congress. Interestingly, the name of the BJP state unit head was Vajubhai Vala and the PM was HD Deve Gowda. This was pointed out by Yashwant Deshmukh, the managing director and chief editor of Centre for Voting Opinion & Trends in Election Research (CVoter).\r The tables have now turned completely.\r Vala, the former Gujarat BJP leader, had once vacated his seat for Narendra Modi and later served as Finance Minister in CM Modi\u2019s cabinet, would also recall this episode from the years gone by. \r Rajkot in Gujarat had been a Congress stronghold. But in 1985, the newly-formed BJP wrested this seat from the Grand Old Party. Since then, the BJP has not lost here. The last time Congress won this seat was back in the year 1980, when Manibhai Ranpara won after polling 19,755 votes. Vajubhai Vala, who was the BJP candidate, was not so far behind with 17,762 votes. In the 1984 elections, Vala finally won the seat by beating Congress candidate Harshdaba Chudasa. Vala remained the MLA from Rajkot West till the year 2002, when he vacated the seat for BJP\u2019s CM-designate Narendra Modi. The future PM won the election from Rajkot West after polling 45,298 votes. His opponent, Congress leader Ashwini Maheta polled 30,570 votes in the bypoll.\r When the BJP formed the government at the Centre in 2014 and Modi finally ascended the high seat in Delhi, Vala was rewarded for keeping the BJP fortress intact and was made the Governor of Karnataka. In the 2014 bypoll, the seat was then passed on to Vijay Rupani, who won the seat by polling 81,092 votes. He beat his Congress opponent Jayanti Kalriya, a patidar, by over 23,000 votes. \r In August 2016, when Chief Minister Anandiben Patel resigned, Rupani was elevated to CM. Rupani retained the seat against his opponent, Indranil Rajyaguru, in the 2017 Gujarat Assembly polls.\r Follow us on Download News18 App"], "https://admission.uod.ac.in/": [" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Dear aspiring students, I take this opportunity of welcoming you all to the University of Delhi, a premier Institute for higher education in India.

Mobile technologies identify their orientation with the help of a small device known as an accelerometer. After reading this article, you will be able to define the accelerometer and understand its working principle in detail. An accelerometer is an electromechanical device that is used to measure acceleration forces. Such forces may be static like the force of gravity or, they may be dynamic as in the case of mobile devices. An accelerometer comes in the form of a simple circuit for a large electronic device. Despite the humble appearance, the accelerometer is made of different parts and works in many ways, two of which are the Piezoelectric Accelerometer and the Capacitance Accelerometer. The piezoelectric effect is the most popular form and uses microscopic crystal structures that get stressed due to accelerative forces. A voltage arises in the crystals from the stress, and the accelerometer translates this voltage to velocity and orientation.\n The capacitance accelerometer senses the changes in capacitance between microstructures. If the accelerative force moves one of these microstructures, the capacitance changes and the accelerometer translates this capacitance into voltage for interpretation. \u00a0 \u00a0 The applications of accelerometer extend to multiple disciplines, following are a few of its uses: Accelerometers are actively used in many electronics today, and it plays an active role in a wide range of functionalities. In many cases, the presence of this simple sensor is unnoticed, and the odds are that you may already be using a device with it.

Modi was the\u00a0chief minister of Gujarat\u00a0from 2001 to 2014 and is the\u00a0Member of Parliament\u00a0from\u00a0Varanasi. He is a member of the\u00a0Bharatiya Janata Party\u00a0(BJP) and of the\u00a0Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh\u00a0(RSS), a right-wing\u00a0Hindu nationalist\u00a0paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the first prime minister to have been born after India\u2019s\u00a0independence\u00a0in 1947 and the second prime minister not belonging to the\u00a0Indian National Congress\u00a0to have won two consecutive majorities in the\u00a0Lok Sabha, or lower house of Indian of parliament. He is also the longest serving prime minister from a non-congress party. Born and raised in\u00a0Vadnagar, a small town in northeastern\u00a0Gujarat, Modi completed his secondary education there. He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has drawn attention to having to work as a child in his father\u2019s tea stall on the Vadnagar railway station platform, a description that has not been reliably corroborated. At age 18, Modi was married to\u00a0Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He left his parental home where she had come to live. He first publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi has asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0declared by prime minister\u00a0Indira Gandhi\u00a0in 1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary. Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to\u00a0Keshubhai Patel\u2019s failing health and poor public image following the\u00a0earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the\u00a02002 Gujarat riots\u00a0in which 1044 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim, or otherwise criticised for its management of the crisis. A\u00a0Supreme Court of India-appointed Special Investigation Team found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally.\u00a0While his policies as chief minister\u2014credited with encouraging economic growth\u2014have received praise, his administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state. Modi led the BJP in the\u00a02014 general election\u00a0which gave the party a majority in the Indian\u00a0lower house\u00a0of parliament, the\u00a0Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since\u00a01984. Modi\u2019s administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy; he has centralised power by abolishing the\u00a0Planning Commission. He began a\u00a0high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a\u00a0demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes\u00a0and\u00a0transformation of taxation regime, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Under Modi\u2019s tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding. Following his party\u2019s victory in the\u00a02019 general election, his administration\u00a0revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir\u00a0and also introduced the\u00a0Citizenship Amendment Act, which resulted in\u00a0widespread protests\u00a0across the country. Described as engineering a political realignment towards\u00a0right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an\u00a0exclusionary social\u00a0agenda. Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a\u00a0Gujarati\u00a0Hindu\u00a0family of grocers in\u00a0Vadnagar,\u00a0Mehsana district,\u00a0Bombay State\u00a0(present-day\u00a0Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c.\u20091915\u20131989) and Hiraben Modi (born\u00a0c.\u20091920).\u00a0Modi\u2019s family belonged to the\u00a0Modh-Ghanchi-Teli\u00a0(oil-presser) community, which is categorised as an\u00a0Other Backward Class\u00a0by the Indian government. Modi had only infrequently spoken of his family background during his 13 years as chief minister of Gujarat. In the run up to the 2014 national elections, he began to regularly draw attention to his low-ranking social origins and to having to work as a child in his father\u2019s tea shop on the\u00a0Vadnagar railway station\u00a0platform, a description that the evidence of neighbours does not entirely corroborate. Modi completed his\u00a0higher secondary education\u00a0in Vadnagar in 1967, where teachers described him as an average student and a keen gifted debater, with interest in theatre. Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image. When eight years old, Modi was introduced to the\u00a0Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh\u00a0(RSS) and began attending its local\u00a0shakhas\u00a0(training sessions). There, Modi met\u00a0Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a\u00a0balswayamsevak\u00a0(junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor. While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda,\u00a0Bharatiya Jana Sangh\u00a0leaders who were founding members of the BJP\u2019s Gujarat unit in 1980. In a custom traditional to Narendra Modi\u2019s caste, his family arranged a\u00a0betrothal\u00a0to a girl,\u00a0Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when she was 17 and he was 18. Soon afterwards, he abandoned his bride,\u00a0and left home, never divorcing her, but the marriage remaining unmentioned in Modi\u2019s public pronouncements for many decades. In April 2014, shortly before the national elections that swept him to power, Modi publicly affirmed that he was married and his spouse was Jashodaben; the couple has remained married, but estranged. Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he went have emerged.\u00a0In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by\u00a0Swami Vivekananda: the\u00a0Belur Math\u00a0near\u00a0Kolkata, followed by the\u00a0Advaita Ashrama\u00a0in\u00a0Almora\u00a0and the\u00a0Ramakrishna Mission\u00a0in\u00a0Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education. Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi\u2019s life. In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the\u00a0Belur Math\u00a0but was turned away, after which Modi wandered through\u00a0Calcutta,\u00a0West Bengal\u00a0and\u00a0Assam, stopping in\u00a0Siliguri\u00a0and\u00a0Guwahati. Modi then went to the\u00a0Ramakrishna Ashram\u00a0in\u00a0Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to\u00a0Gujarat\u00a0via\u00a0Delhi\u00a0and\u00a0Rajasthan\u00a0in 1968\u201369. Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for\u00a0Ahmedabad. There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter\u2019s\u00a0canteen\u00a0at the\u00a0Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation. In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city. Modi\u2019s first known political activity as an adult was in 1971 when he, as per his remarks, joined a\u00a0Jana Sangh\u00a0Satyagraha in Delhi led by\u00a0Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u00a0to enlist for the battlefield during the\u00a0Bangladesh Liberation War. But the\u00a0Indira Gandhi-led central government disallowed open support for the\u00a0Mukti Bahini\u00a0and Modi, according to his own claim, was put in\u00a0Tihar Jail\u00a0for a short period.\u00a0After the\u00a0Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time\u00a0pracharak\u00a0(campaigner) for the\u00a0RSS, working under Inamdar.\u00a0Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested (as per his claim); this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him. Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001. Modi\u2019s claim that he was part of a Satyagraha led to a political war.\u00a0Applications were filed with the\u00a0PMO\u00a0under the\u00a0RTI Act\u00a0seeking details of his arrest. In reply, the PMO claimed that it maintains official records on Modi only since he took charge as the Prime Minister of India in 2014. Despite this claim, the official website of the PMO contains specific information about Modi which dates back to the 1950s. In 1978 Modi received a\u00a0Bachelor of Arts\u00a0degree in\u00a0political science\u00a0from the\u00a0School of Open Learning\u00a0(SOL)\u00a0at the\u00a0University of Delhi, graduating with a\u00a0third class. Five years later, in 1983, he received a\u00a0Master of Arts\u00a0degree in political science from\u00a0Gujarat University, graduating with a\u00a0first class as an external\u00a0distance learning\u00a0student. But there is a big controversy surrounding his educational qualification. Replying to an RTI query, the SOL said it did not have any data of students who received a BA degree in 1978. Jayantibhai Patel, a former political science professor of Gujarat University, claimed that the subjects listed in Modi\u2019s MA degree were not offered by the university when Modi was studying there. In June 1975, Prime Minister\u00a0Indira Gandhi\u00a0declared a\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0in India which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as \u201cThe Emergency\u201d, many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned. Modi was appointed general secretary of the \u201cGujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\u201d, an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned. Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations. Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists. During this period, Modi wrote a book in\u00a0Gujarati,\u00a0Sangharsh Ma Gujarat\u00a0(In The Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency. Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist\u00a0George Fernandes, as well as several other national political figures.\u00a0In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a\u00a0Sikh. Modi became an\u00a0RSS\u00a0sambhag pracharak\u00a0(regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of\u00a0Surat\u00a0and\u00a0Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS\u2019s version of the history of the Emergency. He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP\u2019s campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi\u2019s planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers. After\u00a0L. K. Advani\u00a0became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi\u2019s work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP\u2019s Gujarat unit later in 1987.  Modi rose within the party and was named a member of the BJP\u2019s National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise\u00a0L. K. Advani\u2019s 1990\u00a0Ram Rath Yatra\u00a0in 1990 and\u00a0Murli Manohar Joshi\u2019s 1991\u201392\u00a0Ekta Yatra\u00a0(Journey for Unity). However, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in Ahmedabad; friction with\u00a0Shankersinh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played a part in this decision. Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani, and as party secretary, Modi\u2019s electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly elections.\u00a0In November of that year Modi was appointed BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and\u00a0Himachal Pradesh. The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the\u00a0Indian National Congress\u00a0(Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections. Modi, on the selection committee for the\u00a01998 Assembly elections in Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP leader\u00a0Keshubhai Patel\u00a0over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as key to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections,and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year. In 2001, Keshubhai Patel\u2019s health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in\u00a0by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel\u2019s standing had been damaged by his administration\u2019s handling of the\u00a0earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel\u2019s administration, was chosen as a replacement.\u00a0Although\u00a0BJP\u00a0leader L. K. Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi\u2019s lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel\u2019s\u00a0deputy chief minister, telling Advani and\u00a0Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u00a0that he was \u201cgoing to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all\u201d. On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections.\u00a0Modi was sworn in as Chief Minister on 7 October 2001, and entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 by winning a by-election to the\u00a0Rajkot \u2013 II\u00a0constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC by 14,728 votes. Main article:\u00a02002 Gujarat riots On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers\u00a0burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people. The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from\u00a0Ayodhya\u00a0after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished\u00a0Babri Masjid.\u00a0In making a public statement after the incident, Modi declared it a terrorist attack planned and orchestrated by local Muslims.\u00a0The next day, the\u00a0Vishwa Hindu Parishad\u00a0called for a\u00a0bandh\u00a0across the state. Riots began during the\u00a0bandh, and\u00a0anti-Muslim violence\u00a0spread through Gujarat. The government\u2019s decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence. The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed.\u00a0Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000,\u00a0the vast majority Muslims\u00a0Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.\u00a0Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women. The government of Gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots, (with some blaming chief minister Modi explicitly) and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation.\u00a0Several scholars have described the violence as a\u00a0pogrom, while others have called it an example of\u00a0state terrorism.\u00a0Summarising academic views on the subject,\u00a0Martha Nussbaum\u00a0said: \u201cThere is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law.\u201dThe Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating.\u00a0The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the\u00a0bandh, despite such actions being illegal at the time.\u00a0State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there. Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.\u00a0During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able. Modi\u2019s personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, Modi said that \u201cWhat is happening is a chain of action and reaction.\u201d Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.\u00a0In March 2008, the\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots, including that of the\u00a0Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue. In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri (widow of\u00a0Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre), in April 2009 the court also asked the SIT to investigate the issue of Modi\u2019s complicity in the killings.The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.\u00a0In July 2011, the court-appointed\u00a0amicus curiae\u00a0Raju Ramachandran\u00a0submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT\u2019s position, he said that Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.The Supreme Court gave the matter to the magistrate\u2019s court. The SIT examined Ramachandran\u2019s report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jafri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013 the magistrate\u2019s court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT\u2019s finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister. Main article:\u00a02002 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election In the aftermath of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the\u00a0Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam\u00a0and the\u00a0Telugu Desam Party\u00a0(allies in the BJP-led\u00a0National Democratic Alliance\u00a0coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.\u00a0Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted. His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved.\u00a0Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002. In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.\u00a0Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign, and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters. He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 113,589 of 154,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes.\u00a0On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term. Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly. During Modi\u2019s second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from\u00a0Hindutva\u00a0to Gujarat\u2019s economic development.\u00a0Modi curtailed the influence of\u00a0Sangh Parivar\u00a0organisations such as the\u00a0Bharatiya Kisan Sangh\u00a0(BKS) and the\u00a0Vishva Hindu Parishad\u00a0(VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad\u2019s textile industry,\u00a0and dropped\u00a0Gordhan Zadafia\u00a0(an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief\u00a0Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers\u2019 demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in\u00a0Gandhinagar\u00a0deepened the rift with the\u00a0Vishva Hindu Parishad.\u00a0Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi\u2019s administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a foreword to a textbook by\u00a0Dinanath Batra\u00a0released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including\u00a0test-tube babies. Modi\u2019s relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister\u00a0Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u00a0(who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister)\u00a0distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the\u00a02004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP\u2019s electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots. Questions about Modi\u2019s relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the\u00a0State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the\u00a0Commission on International Religious Freedom\u00a0formed under the aegis of the\u00a0International Religious Freedom Act,\u00a0the only person\u00a0denied a US visa\u00a0under this law. The UK and the\u00a0European Union\u00a0refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK\u00a0and the EU\u00a0lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election he was invited to Washington as the nation\u2019s prime minister. During the run-up to the\u00a02007 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election\u00a0and the\u00a02009 Indian general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism. In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister\u00a0Manmohan Singh\u00a0\u201d\u00a0for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\u201d such as the 2002\u00a0Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the\u00a02006 Mumbai train bombings.\u00a0In 2007 Modi authored\u00a0Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a \u201cspiritual experience\u201d for Valmiks, a sub-caste of\u00a0Dalits. However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct. After the November\u00a02008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat\u2019s 1,600-kilometre (990\u00a0mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats. In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post,\u00a0and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year\u2019s election. As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and\u00a0small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007\u00a0Vibrant Gujarat\u00a0summit, real-estate investment deals worth\u00a0\u20b96.6 trillion\u00a0(equivalent to\u00a0\u20b917\u00a0trillion or US$220\u00a0billion in 2020) were signed. The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were\u00a0check dams, which helped recharge the\u00a0aquifers\u00a0beneath them.\u00a0Sixty of the 112\u00a0tehsils\u00a0which had depleted the\u00a0water table\u00a0in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010. As a result, the state\u2019s production of\u00a0genetically modified cotton\u00a0increased to become the largest in India. The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarat\u2019s agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the\u00a0Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4\u20136% of the area intended.\u00a0Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural\u00a0growth rate\u00a0of 10.97 percent \u2013 the highest of any state.\u00a0However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992\u201397 INC government was 12.9 percent. In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to\u00a0Tata Motors\u00a0to set up a plant manufacturing the\u00a0Nano\u00a0after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata to Gujarat. The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed. Modi significantly changed the state\u2019s system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the\u00a0Jyotigram Yojana\u00a0scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised,\u00a0according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers. A contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat\u2019s economic development during Modi\u2019s tenure as chief minister.\u00a0The state\u2019s GDP growth rate averaged 10% during Modi\u2019s tenure, a value similar to other highly industrialised states, and above that of the country as a whole. Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office, and some scholars have stated that growth did not much accelerate during Modi\u2019s tenure,\u00a0although the state is considered to have maintained a high growth rate during Modi\u2019s Chief Ministership. Under Narendra Modi, Gujarat topped the\u00a0World Bank\u2019s \u201cease of doing business\u201d rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years. In 2013, Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens\u2019 rights and labour and business regulation among the country\u2019s 20 largest states. In the later years of Modi\u2019s government, Gujarat\u2019s economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.\u00a0Tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states, as was land. Modi\u2019s policies to make Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of\u00a0Special Economic Zones, where labour laws were greatly weakened. Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi\u2019s tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the \u201calarming\u201d category on the\u00a0India State Hunger Index. A study by\u00a0UNICEF\u00a0and the Indian government found that Gujarat under Modi had a poor record with respect to\u00a0immunisation\u00a0in children. Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.\u00a0It showed a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined. With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below many Indian states. The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims,\u00a0Dalits, and\u00a0Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities.\u00a0Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the\u00a0Human Development Index. Under Modi, the state government spent less than the national average on education and healthcare. Further information:\u00a02012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election Despite the BJP\u2019s shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi\u2019s election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders. \u00a0He did, however, maintain relations with\u00a0Dawoodi Bohra. His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the\u00a0killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012.\u00a0During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.  While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people,something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of\u00a0Sanjiv Bhatt. The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure \u00a0and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995). After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from\u00a0Maninagar\u00a0on 21 May 2014.\u00a0Anandiben Patel\u00a0succeeded him as the chief minister. Main article:\u00a0Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2014 Indian general election In September 2013 Modi was named the BJP\u2019s candidate for prime minister ahead of the\u00a02014 Lok Sabha election. \u00a0Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modi\u2019s candidature,\u00a0including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were \u201cconcerned with their personal agendas\u201d.\u00a0Modi played a dominant role in the BJP\u2019s election campaign. Several people who voted for the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party.\u00a0The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.\u00a0The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.Modi meets his mother after winning the\u00a02014 elections. During the campaign, Modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous INC government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat.\u00a0Modi projected himself as a person who could bring about \u201cdevelopment,\u201d without focus on any specific policies. His message found support among young Indians and among middle-class citizens. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi\u2019s commitment to\u00a0secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism.\u00a0Prior to the election Modi\u2019s image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, but during the campaign the BJP was able to shift this to a focus on Modi\u2019s\u00a0neoliberal\u00a0ideology and the Gujarat model of development,\u00a0although Hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign.The BJP\u2019s campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media. Modi\u2019s campaign blitz cost around\u00a0\u20b950 billion\u00a0(US$660\u00a0million) and the BJP received extensive financial support from corporate donors. In addition to more conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media,\u00a0and addressed more than 1000 rallies via\u00a0hologram\u00a0appearances. The BJP won 31% of the vote,\u00a0and more than doubled its tally in the\u00a0Lok Sabha\u00a0to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since\u00a01984.\u00a0Voter dissatisfaction with the INC, as well as with regional parties in North India, was another reason for the success of the BJP, as was the support from the RSS. In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before. It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims. The magnitude of the BJP\u2019s victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from\u00a0progressive parties\u00a0and towards the right-wing. Modi\u2019s tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism. Modi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies:\u00a0Varanasi\u00a0and\u00a0Vadodara. He won in both constituencies, defeating\u00a0Aam Aadmi Party\u00a0leader\u00a0Arvind Kejriwal\u00a0in Varanasi by 371,784 votes and\u00a0Madhusudan Mistry\u00a0of the INC in Vadodara by 570,128 votes. Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, was appointed prime minister by India\u2019s president. To comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat. Main article:\u00a0Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2019 Indian general election On 13 October 2018, Modi was renamed as the BJP candidate for prime minister for the\u00a02019 general election. The chief campaigner for the party was BJP\u2019s president\u00a0Amit Shah. Modi launched the\u00a0Main Bhi Chowkidar\u00a0campaign ahead of the general election, against\u00a0Chowkidar Chor Hai\u00a0campaign slogan of\u00a0INC.\u00a0In the year 2018, end\u00a0Party\u2019s, second-biggest alliance\u00a0Telugu Desam Party\u00a0split from\u00a0NDA\u00a0over the matter of special-status for\u00a0Andhra Pradesh. The campaign was started by\u00a0Amit Shah\u00a0on 8 April 2019. In the campaign, Modi was targeted by the opposition on corruption allegations over\u00a0Rafale deal\u00a0with\u00a0France government. Highlighting this\u00a0controversy\u00a0the campaign \u201cChowkidar Chor Hai\u201d was started, which was contrary to \u201cMain Bhi Chowkidar\u201d slogan. Modi made defence and national security among the foremost topics for the\u00a0election campaign, especially after\u00a0Pulwama attack, and the retaliatory attack of\u00a0Balakot airstrike\u00a0was counted as an achievement of the\u00a0Modi administration. Other topics in the campaign were development and\u00a0good foreign relations\u00a0in the first premiership. Modi contested the Lok Sabha elections as a candidate from\u00a0Varanasi. He won the seat by defeating Shalini Yadav of the\u00a0Samajwadi Party, who fought on\u00a0SP-BSP\u00a0alliance by a margin of 479,505 votes.\u00a0Modi was unanimously appointed the prime minister for a second time by the\u00a0National Democratic Alliance, after the alliance won the election for the second time by securing 353 seats in the\u00a0Lok Sabha\u00a0with the\u00a0BJP\u00a0alone won 303 seats. Main article:\u00a0Premiership of Narendra Modi After the\u00a0Bharatiya Janata Party\u00a0led\u00a0National Democratic Alliance\u00a0won a landslide in the\u00a02014 Lok Sabha election, Narendra Modi was\u00a0sworn in as the Prime Minister of India\u00a0on 26 May 2014. He became the first Prime Minister born after India\u2019s\u00a0independence\u00a0from the\u00a0British Empire\u00a0in 1947. Modi started his second term after the\u00a0Bharatiya Janata Party\u00a0led\u00a0National Democratic Alliance\u00a0won again in the\u00a02019 Lok Sabha election. On 6 December 2020, Modi became the 4th longest serving Prime Minister of India and the longest serving Non-Congress\u00a0Prime Minister. Modi\u2019s first year as prime minister saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations. His efforts at centralisation have been linked to an increase in the number of senior administration officials resigning their positions.\u00a0Initially lacking a majority in the\u00a0Rajya Sabha, or upper house of Indian Parliament, Modi passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the\u00a0judiciary. In December 2014 Modi abolished the\u00a0Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India, or\u00a0NITI Aayog. The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister.\u00a0The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice. The Modi government launched investigations by the\u00a0Intelligence Bureau\u00a0against numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations in the first year of the administration. The investigations, on the grounds that these organisations were slowing economic growth, was criticised as a\u00a0witch-hunt. International\u00a0humanitarian aid\u00a0organisation\u00a0Medecins Sans Frontieres\u00a0was among the groups that were put under pressure. Other organisations affected included the\u00a0Sierra Club\u00a0and\u00a0Avaaz. Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi\u2019s style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi. Modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; a total of 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous governments over a span of 64 years. He started a monthly radio programme titled \u201cMann Ki Baat\u201d on 3 October 2014.\u00a0Modi also launched the\u00a0Digital India\u00a0programme, with the goal of ensuring that government services are available electronically, building infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boosting manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promoting\u00a0digital literacy. Modi launched\u00a0Ujjwala scheme\u00a0to provide free LPG connection to rural households. The scheme led to an increase in LPG consumption by 56% in 2019 as compared to 2014.\u00a0In 2019, a law was passed to provide 10% reservation to Economically weaker sections. He was again\u00a0sworn in as prime minister\u00a0on 30 May 2019. On 30 July 2019,\u00a0Parliament of India\u00a0declared the practice of\u00a0Triple Talaq\u00a0as illegal, unconstitutional and made it punishable act from 1 August 2019 which is deemed to be in effect from 19 September 2018. On 5 August 2019, the government moved resolution to scrap Article 370 in the Rajya Sabha, and also reorganise the state with\u00a0Jammu and Kashmir\u00a0serving as one of the union territory and\u00a0Ladakh\u00a0region separated out as a separate union territory. Modi launched the \u2018Operation Ganga\u2019 initiative officially by the government of India to bring back Indians stranded in Ukraine, during the\u00a02022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Under this, India successfully brought back more than a 19,000 of its nationals from the country. This also involved assistance to those who have crossed over to the neighboring countries of Romania, Hungary, Poland, Moldova, Slovakia. Prime Minister Modi sent 4 special envoys headed by the union ministers\u00a0Hardeep Singh Puri,\u00a0Jyotiraditya Scindia,\u00a0Kiren Rijiju\u00a0and\u00a0V. K. Singh\u00a0to the neighboring nations of Ukraine to assist coordination efforts.The\u00a0Indian Air Force\u00a0was also brought into the operation on 1 March 2022.  The economic policies of Modi\u2019s government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, based on a\u00a0neoliberal\u00a0framework.\u00a0Modi liberalised India\u2019s\u00a0foreign direct investment\u00a0policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other proposed reforms included making it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them; some of these proposals were dropped after protests. The reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country\u2019s largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. The\u00a0Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers. The funds dedicated to poverty reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly decreased by the Modi administration.\u00a0The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6% of GDP during the Congress government to 12.6% during Modi\u2019s first year in office.Spending on health and family welfare declined by 15%, and on primary and secondary education by 16%. The budgetary allocation for the\u00a0Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, or the \u201ceducation for all\u201d programme, declined by 22%. The government also lowered corporate taxes, abolished the\u00a0wealth tax, increased sales taxes, and reduced customs duties on gold, and jewellery.\u00a0In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices. In September 2014, Modi introduced the\u00a0Make in India\u00a0initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub.\u00a0Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. Modi\u2019s administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. Modi\u2019s government put in place the\u00a0Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017. In his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate\u00a0black money. On 9 November 2016, the government\u00a0demonetised \u20b9500 and \u20b91000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism.\u00a0The move led to severe cash shortages,\u00a0a steep decline in the Indian stock indices\u00a0BSE SENSEX\u00a0and\u00a0NIFTY 50, and sparked widespread protests throughout the country. Several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash. \u00a0In the subsequent year, the number of income tax returns filed for individuals rose by 25%, and the number of digital transactions increased steeply. Over the first four years of\u00a0Modi\u2019s premiership, India\u2019s GDP grew at an average rate of 7.23%, higher than the rate of 6.39% under the previous government.\u00a0The level of income inequality increased, while an internal government report said that in 2017, unemployment had increased to its highest level in 45 years. The loss of jobs was attributed to the\u00a02016 demonetisation, and to the effects of the\u00a0Goods and Services Tax. In the next year, after 2018,\u00a0Indian economy\u00a0started a gradual recovery with a\u00a0GDP\u00a0growth of 6.12% in 2018\u201319\u00a0FY, with an inflation rate of 3.4%. Same year, India was successful in making a good economy in trade and manufacturing sector. While in the\u00a0FY\u00a0of 2019\u201320, due to the\u00a0general election, Modi government focused more on their\u00a0election campaign. In the year 2019\u201320, the\u00a0GDP\u00a0growth rate was 4.18% and inflation rate also increased to 4.7% from 3.4% in the previous year. Though being high unemployment, increase in inflation rate and budget deficiency, Modi\u2019s leadership won in\u00a02019 elections. Due to the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic, numerous\u00a0rating agencies\u00a0downgraded India\u2019s GDP predictions for FY21 to negative figures, signalling a recession in India, the most severe since 1979. \u00a0According to a\u00a0Dun & Bradstreet\u00a0report, the country is likely to suffer a recession in the third quarter of FY2020 as a result of the over 2-month long\u00a0nation-wide lockdown\u00a0imposed to curb the spread of\u00a0COVID-19. This was also accompanied by the\u00a0mass migration of migrant workers. See also:\u00a0Swachh Bharat Mission In his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the amount of money spent by the central government on healthcare. The Modi government launched New Health Policy (NHP) in January 2015. The policy did not increase the government\u2019s spending on healthcare, instead emphasising the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including reducing child and maternal mortality rates. The\u00a0National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices received nearly 20% less funds in 2015 than in the previous year. 15 national health programmes, including those aimed at controlling tobacco use and supporting healthcare for the elderly, were merged with the National Health Mission. In its budget for the second year after it took office, the Modi government reduced healthcare spending by 15%. The healthcare budget for the following year rose by 19%. The budget was viewed positively by private insurance providers. Public health experts criticised its emphasis on the role of private healthcare providers, and suggested that it represented a shift away from public health facilities. The healthcare budget rose by 11.5% in 2018; the change included an allocation of\u00a0\u20b920 billion\u00a0(US$260\u00a0million) for a government-funded health insurance program, and a decrease in the budget of the National Health Mission. The government introduced stricter packaging laws for tobacco which requires 85% of the packet size to be covered by pictorial warnings.\u00a0An article in the medical journal\u00a0Lancet\u00a0stated that the country \u201cmight have taken a few steps back in public health\u201d under Modi. In 2018 Modi launched the\u00a0Ayushman Bharat Yojana, a government health insurance scheme intended to insure 500\u00a0million people. 100,000 people had signed up by October 2018. Modi emphasised his government\u2019s efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health. On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the\u00a0Swachh Bharat Mission\u00a0(\u201cClean India\u201d) campaign. The stated goals of the campaign included eliminating\u00a0open defecation\u00a0and\u00a0manual scavenging\u00a0within five years. As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them.The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants.\u00a0The administration plans to construct 60\u00a0million toilets by 2019. The construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the toilets constructed for them.\u00a0Sanitation cover in the country increased from 38.7% in October 2014 to 84.1% in May 2018; however, usage of the new sanitary facilities lagged behind the government\u2019s targets.\u00a0In 2018, the\u00a0World Health Organization\u00a0stated that at least 180,000 diarrhoeal deaths were averted in rural India after the launch of the sanitation effort. During the 2014 election campaign, the BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders known to have opposed\u00a0Hindu nationalism, including\u00a0B. R. Ambedkar,\u00a0Subhas Chandra Bose, and\u00a0Ram Manohar Lohia. The campaign also saw the use of rhetoric based on Hindutva by BJP leaders in certain states. Communal tensions were played upon especially in Uttar Pradesh and the states of Northeast India. \u00a0A proposal for the controversial\u00a0Uniform Civil Code\u00a0was a part of the BJP\u2019s election manifesto. The activities of a number of Hindu nationalist organisations increased in scope after Modi\u2019s election as Prime Minister, sometimes with the support of the government. These activities included a Hindu\u00a0religious conversion\u00a0programme, a campaign against the alleged Islamic practice of \u201cLove Jihad\u201d, and attempts to celebrate\u00a0Nathuram Godse, the assassin of\u00a0Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right wing\u00a0Hindu Mahasabha. Officials in the government, including the Home Minister, defended the conversion programmes.  Links between the\u00a0BJP\u00a0and the RSS grew stronger under Modi. The RSS provided organisational support to the BJP\u2019s electoral campaigns, while the Modi administration appointed a number of individuals affiliated with the RSS to prominent government positions. In 2014,\u00a0Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, became the chairperson of the\u00a0Indian Council of Historical Research\u00a0(ICHR). Historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the BJP, questioned his credentials as a historian, and stated that the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism. The\u00a0North East Delhi riots, which left more than 40 dead and hundreds injured, were triggered by protests against a\u00a0citizenship law\u00a0seen by many critics as\u00a0anti-Muslim\u00a0and part of Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist agenda. On 5 August 2020, Modi visited\u00a0Ayodhya\u00a0after the\u00a0Supreme Court in 2019\u00a0ordered a\u00a0contested land in Ayodhya\u00a0to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple and ordered the government to give alternate 5 acre land to Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque. He became the first prime minister to visit\u00a0Ram Janmabhoomi\u00a0and\u00a0Hanuman Garhi. Foreign policy played a relatively small role in Modi\u2019s election campaign, and did not feature prominently in the BJP\u2019s election manifesto. Modi invited all the other leaders of\u00a0SAARC\u00a0countries to his swearing in ceremony as prime minister. He was the first Indian prime minister to do so. Modi\u2019s foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding INC government, focused on improving economic ties, security, and regional relations. Modi continued Manmohan Singh\u2019s policy of \u201cmulti-alignment.\u201d The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially in East Asia, with the use of slogans such as \u201cMake in India\u201d and \u201cDigital India\u201d. The government also tried to improve relations with\u00a0Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as\u00a0Bahrain,\u00a0Iran,\u00a0Saudi Arabia, and the\u00a0United Arab Emirates, as well as with\u00a0Israel.  The\u00a0foreign relations of India\u00a0with the USA also mended after Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister. During the run-up to the general election there was wide-ranging scepticism regarding future of the\u00a0strategic bilateral relation\u00a0under Modi\u2019s premiership as in 2005 he was, while\u00a0Chief Minister of Gujarat, denied a U.S. visa during the\u00a0Bush administration\u00a0for his\u00a0poor\u00a0human rights records. However sensing Modi\u2019s inevitable victory well before the election, the\u00a0US Ambassador\u00a0Nancy Powell\u00a0had reached out to him as part of greater\u00a0rapprochement\u00a0from the west. Moreover, following his 2014 election as the Prime Minister of India\u00a0President Obama\u00a0congratulated him over the telephone and invited him to visit the US. \u00a0Modi government has been successful in making good foreign relations with the\u00a0USA\u00a0in the presidency of both\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0and\u00a0Donald Trump. During the first few months after the election, Modi made trips to a number of different countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the\u00a0BRICS,\u00a0ASEAN, and\u00a0G20\u00a0summits. One of Modi\u2019s first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid. \u00a0Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country. \u00a0While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, the visits were expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries. In 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land exchange deal with Bangladesh about the\u00a0India\u2013Bangladesh enclaves, which had been initiated by the government of Manmohan Singh. Modi\u2019s administration gave renewed attention to India\u2019s \u201cLook East Policy\u201d, instituted in 1991. The policy was renamed the \u201cAct East Policy\u201d, and involved directing Indian foreign policy towards\u00a0East Asia\u00a0and\u00a0Southeast Asia. The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with\u00a0Myanmar, through the state of\u00a0Manipur. This represented a break with India\u2019s historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade. China\u2013India relations\u00a0have deteriorated rapidly following the\u00a02020 China\u2013India skirmishes. Modi has pledged aid of $900 million to Afghanistan, visited the nation twice and been honoured with the nation\u2019s highest civilian honour in 2016. India\u2019s nominal military spending increased steadily under Modi. The military budget declined over Modi\u2019s tenure both as a fraction of GDP and when adjusted for inflation.\u00a0A substantial portion of the military budget was devoted to personnel costs, leading commentators to write that the budget was constraining Indian military modernisation. The BJP election manifesto had also promised to deal with illegal immigration into India in the Northeast, as well as to be more firm in its handling of insurgent groups. The Modi government issued a notification allowing Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to legalise their residency in India. The government described the measure as being taken for humanitarian reasons but it drew criticism from several Assamese organisations. The Modi administration negotiated a peace agreement with the largest faction of the\u00a0National Socialist Council of Nagaland\u00a0(NSCM), which was announced in August 2015. The\u00a0Naga\u00a0insurgency in northeast India had begun in the 1950s. The NSCM and the government had agreed to a ceasefire in 1997, but a peace accord had not previously been signed. In 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the Khaplang faction of the NSCM (NSCM-K). The NSCM-K responded with a series of attacks, which killed 18 people.\u00a0The Modi government carried out a raid across the border with Myanmar as a result, and labelled the NSCM-K a terrorist organisation. Modi promised to be \u201ctough on Pakistan\u201d during his election campaign, and repeatedly stated that Pakistan was an\u00a0exporter of terrorism. On 29 September 2016, the Indian Army stated that it had conducted a\u00a0surgical strike\u00a0on terror\u00a0launch pads\u00a0in\u00a0Azad Kashmir. The Indian media claimed that up to 50 terrorists and Pakistani soldiers had been killed in the strike.Pakistan initially denied that any strikes had taken place. Subsequent reports suggested that Indian claim about the scope of the strike and the number of casualties had been exaggerated, although cross-border strikes had been carried out. In February 2019 India carried out\u00a0airstrikes\u00a0in Pakistan against a supposed terrorist camp.\u00a0Further military skirmishes\u00a0followed, including cross-border shelling and the loss of an Indian aircraft. Following his victory in\u00a02019 Lok Sabha elections, he focused more on Defence policies of India, especially against China and Pakistan. On 5 May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops engaged in aggressive\u00a0melee, face-offs and\u00a0skirmishes\u00a0at locations along the\u00a0Sino-Indian border, including near the disputed\u00a0Pangong Lake\u00a0in\u00a0Ladakh\u00a0and the\u00a0Tibet Autonomous Region, and near the border between\u00a0Sikkim\u00a0and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Additional clashes also took place at locations in eastern Ladakh along the\u00a0Line of Actual Control\u00a0(LAC). After which there was start of\u00a0skirmishes\u00a0between the nations leading to many border clashes, responses and reactions from both sides. A series of talks were also held between the two by both military and diplomatic means for peace. The first border clash reported in 2021 was on 20 January, referred to as a minor border clash in\u00a0Sikkim. Modi signed an agreement with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in December 2021 to extend military technical cooperation. The Modi government struck a deal with Russia, buying the\u00a0S-400 missile system, an anti-missile striking system thereby constructing much stronger ties and relationship between the two nations. During the\u00a02022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, India refused to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion and stayed neutral, without opting to back both the countries . In naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the \u201cMinistry of Environment and Forests\u201d the \u201cMinistry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change.\u201d In the first budget of the government, the money allotted to this ministry was reduced by more than 50%.\u00a0The new ministry also removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection. These included no longer requiring clearance from the\u00a0National Board for Wildlife\u00a0for projects close to protected areas, and allowing certain projects to proceed before environmental clearance was received.\u00a0The government also tried to reconstitute the Wildlife board such that it no longer had representatives from non-governmental organisations: however, this move was prevented by the\u00a0Supreme Court. Modi also relaxed or abolished a number of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries.bThe changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by\u00a0environmentalists. Under the UPA government that preceded Modi\u2019s administration, field trials of\u00a0Genetically Modified (GM) crops\u00a0had essentially been put on hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods. Under the Modi government these restrictions were gradually lifted. The government received some criticism for freezing the bank accounts of environmental group\u00a0Greenpeace, citing financial irregularities, although a leaked government report said that the freeze had to do with Greenpeace\u2019s opposition to GM crops.\u00a0At the\u00a0COP26\u00a0conference Modi announced that India would target\u00a0carbon neutrality\u00a0by 2070, and also expand its renewable energy capacity. Though the date of net zero is far behind that of China and the USA and India\u2019s government wants to continue with the use of coal, Indian environmentalists and economists applauded the decision, describing it as a bold climate action.  Under Modi\u2019s tenure, India has experienced\u00a0democratic backsliding.According to one study, \u201cThe BJP government incrementally but systemically attacked nearly all existing mechanisms that are in place to hold the political executive to account, either by ensuring that these mechanisms became subservient to the political executive or were captured by party loyalists.\u201d Scholars also point to how the Modi government has used state power to intimidate and stifle critics in the media and academia, thus undermining freedom of expression and alternative sources of information. There have been several reports of the\u00a0Modi government\u00a0to be as an\u00a0authoritarian conservative\u00a0government, even due to lack of good\u00a0opposition. In accordance with Ghanchi tradition, Modi\u2019s marriage was arranged by his parents when he was a child. He was engaged at age 13 to\u00a0Jashodaben Modi, marrying her when he was 18. They spent little time together and grew apart when Modi began two years of travel, including visits to Hindu\u00a0ashrams.\u00a0Reportedly, their marriage was never\u00a0consummated, and he kept it a secret because otherwise he could not have become a \u2018pracharak\u2019 in the puritan\u00a0Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. \u00a0Modi kept his marriage secret for most of his career. He acknowledged his wife for the first time when he filed his nomination for the 2014 general elections. Modi maintains a close relationship with his\u00a0centenarian\u00a0mother, Hiraben. A\u00a0vegetarian\u00a0and teetotaler, Modi has a frugal lifestyle and is a\u00a0workaholic\u00a0and introvert. A person named Badri Meena has been his cook since 2002. Modi\u2019s 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with citizens on a live chat. Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved\u00a0kurta, as well as for a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President\u00a0Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. \u00a0Modi\u2019s personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic. He had published a Gujarati book titled\u00a0Jyotipunj\u00a0in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of\u00a0M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as\u00a0Pujniya Shri Guruji\u00a0(\u201cGuru worthy of worship\u201d).\u00a0According to\u00a0The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children. The nomination of Modi for the prime ministership drew attention to his reputation as \u201cone of contemporary India\u2019s most controversial and divisive politicians.\u201d During the 2014 election campaign the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader, who would be able to take difficult decisions.\u00a0Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, in a manner unusual for the BJP and RSS.\u00a0Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and \u201cdevelopment\u201d.\u00a0Nonetheless, his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy.Modi\u2019s hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.\u00a0In March 2021, Modi received his fir COVID-19 vaccine dose at the\u00a0All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Modi has made donations for various causes and programmes. One such instance was when Modi donated\u00a0\u20b9225,000\u00a0(US$3,000) towards the initial corpus of the\u00a0Prime Minister\u2019s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM-CARES)\u00a0Fund.\u00a0In his role as\u00a0chief minister of Gujarat, Modi had donated\u00a0\u20b92.1 million\u00a0(US$28,000) from personal savings for educating daughters of state government officials. Modi had also raised\u00a0\u20b9899.6 million\u00a0(US$12\u00a0million) by auctioning all the gifts he received as chief minister and donated this to the Kanya Kelavani Fund. The money was spent on the\u00a0education of girl children, through the scheme. Modi interacting with the school children after delivering his address on\u00a0Independence Day\u00a0in New Delhi, 15 August 2017. As a Prime Minister, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings; at the end of his first year in office, he received an overall approval rating of 87% in a Pew Research poll, with 68% of people rating him \u201cvery favorably\u201d and 93% approving of his government. His approval rating remained largely consistent at around 74% through his second year in office, according to a nationwide poll conducted by instaVaani. At the end of his second year in office, an updated Pew Research poll showed Modi continued to receive high overall approval ratings of 81%, with 57% of those polled rating him \u201cvery favorably.\u201d\u00a0At the end of his third year in office, a further Pew Research poll showed Modi with an overall approval rating of 88%, his highest yet, with 69% of people polled rating him \u201cvery favorably.\u201d\u00a0A poll conducted y\u00a0The Times of India\u00a0in May 2017 showed 77% of the respondents rated Modi as \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d.\u00a0In early 2017, a survey from\u00a0Pew Research Center\u00a0showed Modi to be the most popular figure in Indian politics.\u00a0In a weekly analysis by\u00a0Morning Consult\u00a0called the Global Leader Approval Rating Tracker, Modi had the highest net approval rating as of 22 December 2020 of all government leaders in the 13 countries being tracked. In March 2012 and June 2014, Modi appeared on the cover of the Asian edition of\u00a0Time Magazine, one of the few Indian politicians to have done so. He was awarded\u00a0Indian of the Year\u00a0by\u00a0CNN-News18\u00a0(formally\u00a0CNN-IBN) news network in 2014.

Originally his familly belonged to Mandalgarh in Bhilwara but his grand father had shifted to Udaipur from there.Shri Bhandari\u2019s father Dr. Sujan Singh Bhandari had used to work in medical field. That had always kept him moving. Shri Bhandari got his education at several places. He had passed his High School from \u2018Sirohi\u2019, Intermediate from Udaipur and BA and MA from DAV College Kanpur. He passed his MA in Economics and later studied Law. Shri Bhandari was the embodiment of \u201cSimple living and high thinking\u201d. A calm and cool, Shri Bhandari had remained bachelor throughout his life and dedicated his life to the service of the nation.  Shri Bhandari was the embodiment of \u201cSimple living and high thinking\u201d. A calm and cool, Shri Bhandari had remained bachelor throughout his life and dedicated his life to the service of the nation. He after completing his education in 1942 had started legal practice in Mewar High Court. In 1937 he took admission in Intermediate in S.D. College Kanpur where Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhayay was his companion. In December 1937 Shri Balu Mahashabde of Indore took him to a RSS Shakha in Nawabganj near Kanpur. Since then he had remained committed to R.S.S. ideology till his last breath. In 1951 when Bhartiya Jansangh was founded, the prominent names which were assigned by the RSS for Jansangh had also included the name of Shri Bhandari. From 1951 to 1965 Shri Bhandari had looked after the duties of Mahamantri in Rajasthan Jansangh. Moreover he was made All India Mantri of Jansangh in 1963 itself. After the death of Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhayay, Shri Bhandari ji was made All India Mahamantri (Sanghthan) in 1968. He had worked as Jansangh Mahamantri till 1977. He has also been the member of the Rajya Sabha from Rajasthan during 1966- 1972 and he was once elected to Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh in 1976 while he was in custody under MISA. In 1998 when his Rajya Sabha term came to an end he was appointed governor of Bihar. In 1999 he was appointed Governor of Gujrat. Bhandari Ji presented before the Karyakartas an example of simplicity, forebearence and austerity. The people might have found his way of working as hard but by nature he was very soft, so as to maintain the image of a disciplined party. He used to ask the workers maintain decorum in the life style, he was a sculptor and efficient craftsman who had made the Karyakartas of man, society and the organization. He never desired to become KALASH. That is why he was frank by nature.Due to his hard nature and hard attitude towards work, Karyakartas used to call him as Head Master. On June 22, 2005 he left for his heavenly abode. At 5 in the morning Shri Sunder Singh Bhandari, who had dedicated his whole life in the service of motherland and who had remained a RSS Pracharak throughout his life, breathed his last in his Kalka Ji residence in New Delhi. In his death the country has lost an outstanding nationalist and the motherland has lost her distinguished son. The BJP has also lost its friend, philosopher and guide. \u00a92019 KAMAL SANDESH BLOGS ALL RIGHTS RESERVED"], "https://photofocus.com/photography/how-to-make-magic-with-a-flash-and-rear-sync/": [" A ThinkTAP company The most powerful flash setting you have is the one that controls when your flash fires. This setting works for your pop-up flash, for a speedlight on your camera, and for any off-camera light you\u2019re controlling. It\u2019s called Rear Sync, or 2nd Curtain. The shutter in your camera isn\u2019t like a door that swings open and closed. It\u2019s more like two sliding doors\u2013the first one slides open and the second slides closed after it. This is why sync speeds are important when working with flash\u2013if your shutter speed is too fast, the doors will be partly closed when the flash goes off. The default setting for your flash is to fire as soon as the doors are open(front sync/1st curtain), and then the second door closes having let the flash illuminate your subject. When you have a slow shutter speed and a subject that\u2019s moving, however, you\u2019ll see that the flash lights your subject, but then as she keeps moving she blurs through herself, possibly becoming unrecognizable (and possibly looking very cool). This is when the flash fires at the beginning of the exposure. Panasonic GH4, Olympus 17mm f/1.8 lens, f/8, 2 seconds, ISO 100. There was no flash fired in this exposure, just a constant light shining from high and behind my dancing subject. Each time she paused slightly, the light burned a little brighter, like on her clear face at the right side of the frame. Set it to rear sync (Nikon) or 2nd curtain (Canon, Panasonic) and the camera fires the flash at the end of the exposure, just before the second door closes. This way, your subject is moving and blurring, and then gets frozen by the flash at the end. This usually makes the face sharp and recognizable, and yields more repeatable results than front curtain. I set my cameras to 2nd curtain and leave them there. You\u2019ll really only notice the difference when speeds are slow and there\u2019s some movement on either side of the camera. Purposely using a slow shutter speed is called \u201cdragging the shutter\u201d. (Note: if you set to 2nd Curtain and use anything but Manual mode with your pop-up flash, you may notice that the camera chooses a longer shutter speed than it does in 1st curtain mode; this is because it\u2019s allowing the ambient light to burn in and balance with the flash, which is generally a nice thing\u2026unless you\u2019re trying to handhold a 1/4 second exposure on the wedding dance floor and aren\u2019t expecting it. Practice these settings before you\u2019re in a situation where it counts.) Dragging the shutter is commonly used to allow ambient light to burn brighter in a picture\u2013usually so it\u2019ll match the brightness of strobe light (FYI: strobe=flash=strobe). But if you want to really have some fun, set your shutter speed slow, adjust the flash and other settings so the picture looks good, then move the camera during the picture. Panasonic GH4, Leica Nocticron, f/1.2, 1/4s, ISO 100. For this portrait, I setup the picture based on a quarter of a second exposure. We\u2019re downtown after dark, so there are lights in the background. With the camera mounted on a tripod, I locked focus on her face, then panned the camera to the right so she was out of the frame, then fired the shutter and quickly panned the camera back the other way so she came back into the picture. The flash fired at the end of the picture, freezing her face in place with the blur trailing into her. I really thinks it\u2019s important to use a tripod for this. It\u2019ll take several tries to get the timing right, and then once you\u2019ve got the timing down you can start to alter other variables, like facial expressions. If you\u2019re hand holding, though, you\u2019ll end up missing the best expressions. If you don\u2019t have a tripod, then by all means, give it a go hand held, but I think you\u2019ll see better results on some sticks. Here are a few of the tries I made at the same time as the shot above. Panasonic GH4, Leica Nocticron, f/1.2, 1/4s, ISO 100. Panasonic GH4, Leica Nocticron, f/1.2, 1/4s, ISO 100. Panasonic GH4, Leica Nocticron, f/1.2, 1/4s, ISO 100. Another great way to use rear sync flash is to move the subject while the camera holds still. Using the tripod here makes sure you can repeat the picture, but it also allows you talk to your subject and give coaching and suggestions without having your face mashed up to the back of a black box. For these portraits, I was shooting in the daytime at the beach with dense cloud cover which made the sky dark enough that I didn\u2019t have to stop my lens too far down. Using f/4 gave me a shutter speed of just 1/40th of a second, which is slow enough if my subject moves enough. More importantly, f/4 is a big enough aperture that I don\u2019t have to turn the flash all the way to full power to get enough light. A slow shutter is my goal, but when it\u2019s bright outside I have to get that speed with a smaller aperture, and aperture is the primary limiter of flash brightness. I\u2019m afraid, this isn\u2019t a flash basics article, so let\u2019s move on. I wanted my subject to appear solid near the light (on camera-left) and have a trail from the right. I asked her to lean toward the light, got the exposure just right, locked focus, then asked her to lean away from the light and quickly lean back toward it. Panasonic GH4, Leica Nocticron, f/4, 1/40s, ISO 100. Remember, it usually takes several tries to get the subject moving the right way and expressing the right way\u2013you gotta get a tripod for a this stuff. Panasonic GH4, Leica Nocticron, f/4, 1/40s, ISO 100. Panasonic GH4, Leica Nocticron, f/4, 1/40s, ISO 100. The previous examples were made outdoors with speedlights, and I had no control over the ambient light conditions and backgrounds. One thing you\u2019ll learn as you start doing this is that the background makes all the difference. street lamps in the back can end up showing through your subject\u2019s face, and a sky that is too bright won\u2019t give enough definition. Black backgrounds give the best results for showing off your subject because they don\u2019t expose through the subject. Look at these on white and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Panasonic GH4, Olympus 17mm f/1.8 lens, f/8, 2 seconds, ISO 100. Panasonic GH4, Olympus 17mm f/1.8 lens, f/8, 1 second, ISO 100. Compare the images above with this one. There is little change in exposure settings, only in switching the background to black, which gives a more solid portrait at the end of the exposure. Panasonic GH4, Olympus 17mm f/1.8 lens, f/8, 2 seconds, ISO 100. The light you can see on the left side of the frame is just the modeling lamp from one of my strobes; it\u2019s a 60 watt light bulb, and it\u2019s tungsten. At the end of the exposure, the flash on the right side of the frame fired, and it\u2019s a big 4\u2032 square soft box. Now I\u2019ve got control of both my ambient light (the light bulb) and my flash. As my subject dances across the frame the light bulb burns her blurry movements onto the sensor, then the flash freezes her pose at the end. Longer shutter speeds give her more time to dance, but they also brighten everything in the room, so it takes some experimenting to get things looking how you like. I love the silky look of her body blur as it moves across the frame. Let me beat the dead horse: use a tripod! There\u2019s one important technique to making this all work: excitement. I tell the subject what to do, we make a frame or two, then I show her the results so she knows what we\u2019re going for. When she sees this incredible effect right on the camera, she always gets excited, which makes her more patient to practice a few more times to prefect the image. The tripod makes this repeatability possible, and it\u2019s more respectful of her efforts because it guarantees good results. Panasonic GH4, Panasonic 7-14mm f/4 lens, f/8, 2 seconds, ISO 100. Panasonic GH4, Olympus 17mm f/1.8 lens, f/8, 2 seconds, ISO 100. Panasonic GH4, Olympus 17mm f/1.8 lens, f/8, 2 seconds, ISO 100. If you can set your camera to rear sync or 2nd curtain flash, you can make this kind of picture. Try it with your pop-up, but I bet you\u2019ll be wanting something off camera in no time. A tripod will make the pictures better, and shooting on a black background makes faces more distinct. Give it a shot and knock your subjects\u2019 socks off with an incredible image right in the camera that doesn\u2019t require any photoshop magic.

They are so convinced these drives are perfect for everything from writing essays to video editing. But, would you know if the drive has everything you need? Well, in this article we\u2019ll take a look at the pros and cons of buying 512GB SSD for students. I believe that when it comes to choosing an SSD, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.  Solid-state drives use NAND flash memory to store data. This gives them faster load times and better performance compared to hard disk drives, which rely on mechanical parts like spinning platters and reading heads to find and retrieve data.SSDs offer much faster load speeds than HDDs in a wide variety of applications. In fact, SSDs can be up to 20 times faster in loading programs, opening large documents, or booting up your computer. The design of an SSD is much simpler than that of a traditional HDD, which has a lot of moving parts. The mechanical nature of the HDD makes it prone to overheating and excessive vibration. A solid-state drive uses less power than a mechanical hard drive, which means it reduces your laptop\u2019s overall power consumption. This allows you to extend the battery life of your laptop by several hours, which is crucial for students who are constantly on the move. There are no moving parts, so if you drop your computer or otherwise subject it to minor trauma, you probably won\u2019t lose any data as long as the SSD isn\u2019t actually damaged by the force of impact or penetrated by something sharp (like a knife). Hard drives make noise and they can be very loud, especially if you\u2019re working with a large drive. If you have multiple drives (as many people do) then your computer can sound like a jet engine. SSDs, on the other hand, are completely silent because they don\u2019t use moving parts. This is one of the biggest benefits of going with an SSD instead of a traditional HDD. While they have become increasingly affordable in the last couple of years, they\u2019re still more expensive than mechanical hard drives. This is by no means a deal-breaker, but something to consider when you\u2019re buying a new machine for school. The 512GB SSD is a single storage device, so if you ever need more space, you\u2019ll have to replace that drive. With the 1TB HDD and 120GB SSD combo, you can make a backup of your 120GB SSD on the 1TB HDD and then upgrade the 120GB drive. You\u2019d be in the same situation if you upgraded to a 256GB SSD or a higher capacity SSD. Well, it all depends on who you are and what kind of computer you\u2019re using. If you\u2019re a heavy storage user, 512GB is not a lot of storage. If you are a little user then 512GB is definitely enough for you. It\u2019s just that when it comes to computers, there are different kinds of storage requirements for different people. For example: If you\u2019re a photographer or videographer who needs to store lots of images or videos, then 512GB will not be enough for you. On the other hand, if you\u2019re just an average computer user who uses the internet and occasionally plays games etc., then 512GB will be fine for your purposes. The type of hard disk drive (HDD) also plays a role in determining how much storage space is available to use on any given computer system. For example, if your HDD doesn\u2019t have more than one terabyte (TB) worth of space available in it, then no amount of upgrading will increase that number significantly beyond what was originally installed by default when the machine was purchased new from the manufacturer. \u00a0  A 512GB SSD is a lot of space and should be more than enough storage for a student. The only thing you will want to keep in mind is PC specs. If you get a laptop that has a lower amount of RAM this could affect how well the hard drive performs because it will not have enough system memory to work efficiently. Luckily, most laptops come with at least 4GB of RAM nowadays, but if you are buying older models, check out the specs before purchasing them to make sure there is enough system memory to run the computer smoothly. FAQ\u2019s For most people in college, a 256GB SSD is a good place to start. A 256GB SSD can hold enough data for your most important applications and documents, including Microsoft Office and other productivity software, and it\u2019s not too expensive. If you\u2019re in STEM or another major that requires extensive use of software for your classes, you might want to consider stepping up to a 500GB or 1TB drive. You can also choose to get a larger drive as your primary storage and pair it with an external hard drive for your extra files. It depends on what you want to do with it. If you\u2019re looking for a laptop, then yes, 512GB is plenty of space for most people. However, if you\u2019re building a custom desktop or need to store large amounts of data, then 512GB might not be enough storage space for your needs.  Yes. 512GB SSD is fine for engineering majors. After downloading all the software needed for engineering majors, It is expected at least 330GB of free space will be left. However, it is likely that you will need more space if you download a lot of video games, movies, music, etc. The answer is yes, 512GB is plenty of space for most people. The average person stores about 128GB -256 GB of data on their computer. If you\u2019re a student who needs to carry around lots of textbooks and course materials, 512GB might be all you need. But if you\u2019re planning on editing photos and videos or running other types of creative software, then 512GB probably won\u2019t give you enough space for all the data you\u2019ll need. So, if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t want to worry about running out of space on your laptop, consider opting for at least 1TB of storage. 512 GB may be enough for now, but soon you will need more. It\u2019s not a question of whether it\u2019s enough, it\u2019s how much would you like to spend on your storage. If you are a student and you\u2019re going to use this computer only for classes and assignments, then 256GB should be sufficient for you. But if you are looking for something that can last for many years, then I would suggest getting at least 512 GB or maybe even 1 TB. It depends on what kind of programming you do. If you are a developer, 512GB SSD is good enough. If you are a graphic designer, 512GB SSD may not be enough. It depends on what you\u2019re doing. 8GB RAM is enough for most users, but if you are a heavy multitasker or have a large number of tabs open, then it may not be enough. 512GB of storage is enough for most users, but if you have a lot of photos and videos, you\u2019ll probably want more space. If you plan on using your laptop for gaming or high-performance tasks like video editing, then look for a laptop with at least an 8th Gen Core i7 processor. If you want the best value for your money, then look for a laptop with an 8th Gen Core i5 processor and a 256GB SSD. These laptops will be fast enough for everyday use without costing an arm and a leg. A 512GB SSD can be used for years, however, it will depend on your usage. If you are a heavy gamer and download high-resolution games, then you will start to run out of space after 1 year. If you use the laptop as an average user who watches movies and uses social media, then it will last more than 4 years.  The short answer is yes. Unless you want to store lots of videos, and pictures, store games, or work with file-intensive programs, 512 GB should serve you well in most cases. That said, it can\u2019t hurt to have a little extra storage capacity. If 512 GB is too much for your taste, feel free to scale back to 256 GB which will still get the job done just fine. Yes, it is. I have a 512GB SSD, installed Windows 11 on it and it works perfectly fine. I have a few games, Photoshop, and many other programs installed on the SSD and they load pretty fast. The answer depends on how you plan to use your laptop. If you want a superfast system for video editing and other heavy-duty tasks, you\u2019ll need at least 512GB of storage. For general use, 256GB is enough to get by, especially if you keep the Windows 10 system files in the cloud. If you have a budget in mind, here\u2019s a guide to how much SSD storage is enough for your laptop: 64GB: A good size for anyone who doesn\u2019t store much data locally. 64GB is enough room for several apps plus some tunes, photos, and documents. If you only use one or two large apps at a time, this will be more than enough room for everything else too. 128GB: A great sweet spot between price and performance; 128GB will keep most people happy with their laptops\u2019 storage options \u2014 although heavy users may find themselves running low on space after installing lots of apps and games onto their machines. 256GB: Plenty of space for most users; 256GB gives you plenty of room for apps, games, and other files without having to worry about running out of space on your laptop anytime soon. 512 GB: This is the gold standard; if you can afford it, 512 GB is an excellent choice because it gives you plenty of breathing room for everything from work documents to music collections \u2014 plus there\u2019s still plenty left over The short answer is, that it depends. If you\u2019re a heavy user someone who regularly fills up the storage on your device then yes, you probably do need 1TB. If you\u2019re someone who stores photos, movies, and music locally on your computer instead of in the cloud, then maybe not. But here\u2019s the thing: The only way to know for sure is to try it out yourself. Here\u2019s what I mean. I recently bought an external hard drive that holds 2TB of data (up from my previous 2TB model). It was so fast at copying files over that I began wondering if I really needed to keep all my stuff on an external drive. Sure enough, as soon as I started trying to use all that extra space, everything slowed down again. The problem is that we don\u2019t have a very good sense of how much storage we actually need until we have it and start using it. And even then, we may not know until after we\u2019ve used it for months or years which is why some people always seem to be buying bigger devices than they actually need right now.  512GB is more than enough for most users. If you want to keep all your files on your SSD, that means you can get away with a 256GB model. If you want to keep some programs and games on the SSD and store other files elsewhere, then 512GB is a better choice. Computer processing systems use a binary system that uses powers of 2, and some applications show statistics using the metric system. This can cause confusion, as well as errors when conversion is attempted. For example, a 512GB solid-state drive has 477GB of usable space. The discrepancy stems from the fact that a kilobyte (kB) is 1,024 bytes, not 1,000. Once you multiply that 2.4% error several times, you get a pretty significant discrepancy (476.8GB vs. 477GB). As far as storage is concerned, 256GB is a good amount but not ideal. If you are looking to store a lot of movies and music then this will be fine since they tend to be small files. However, if you are looking to store big games and other applications then 256GB might not be enough. If this is the case, then it would be better to go for a 512GB or 1TB laptop because these will have more space for larger files. \u00a0 Tags: College Student  Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.  \n\n"], "https://www.gbu.ac.in/": [" \n \"Registration link for Phone/Tablet for UG & PG Students of GBU Under SVYE Scheme, U.P.

Hats off to the marketing wizards at Cupertino, because the Applespeak does make the new feature sound life-changing. Let me assure you \u2014 it`s not. It`s not game-changing either, but truth be told, most other bits in that description are fairly accurate.

There`s even a new crash detection feature that detects if you`ve been in a car crash and alerts emergency services automatically.I have the iPhone 14 Pro Max in my hand, and it`s a loaded device for sure, And yet, it doesn`t come across as a significant upgrade when compared to its predecessor, at least at first glance.

He is the current Prime Minister of India serving since 2014. He was the 14th Chief Minister of the state of Gujarat.[3] Modi was elected Prime Minister of India in May 2014.[4] He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party.\n Narendra Modi was born into a Hindu Gujarati family in Vadnagar. As a child, he used to help his Father, who ran a tea stall at Vadnagar railway station.  Later, he and his brother ran a tea stall of their own at a bus terminus.[5][6]\n In 1978, Modi received a B.A. degree in political science from School of Open Learning[7] at University of Delhi, graduating with a third class.[8] Five years later, in 1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University,[9][10] as an external distance learning student.[11]\n Modi led the BJP in the 2014 Indian general election which gave the party a majority in the Indian lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984.[12] He soon became Prime Minister of India.\n PM Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign investment in the Indian economy and cut spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Moreover, The Modi government has also amendments to existing environmental and labour laws.\n Following his party's victory in the 2019 Indian general election, introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, which resulted in widespread protests across the country.\n Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration oversaw the 2002 Gujarat riots, and he was criticized on how he handled it initially which was his starting career as a chief minister .[13][14][15][16]\n As a Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has had high approval ratings.[17] In early 2017, a survey from Pew Research Center showed Modi to be the most popular figure in Indian politics.[18]\n In 1968, he married Jashodaben.[19] However, the couple has been separated. Narendra has a close relationship with his mother, Hiraben.[20] He is a vegetarian.[21]\n"], "https://www.listennotes.com/top-podcasts/vajubhai-vala/": [""], "https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Sadhu_Sundar_Singh": [" \n Sadhu Sundar Singh (1889 - 1929), born in Patiala State, India, became an Indian Christian missionary whose life and message had a far ranging impact. Born into a Sikh family, Sundar grew up a faithful Sikh. When a boy, he converted to Christianity, incurring the rejection by his father. Sundar withdrew from a Christian seminary after refusing to cast off his Sikh clothing and wear Western clothing. That set the direction of his ministry, seeking to wear the clothing and speak the terminology of the Sikh while conveying the Christian message. Sundar's impact went far and wide, influencing important spiritual leaders, such as Mahatma Ghandi and C.S. Lewis. He is believed to have died in the foothills of the Himalayas in 1929, although his body was never found.\n The international Christian missionary press focused upon Sundar Singh's Christian message, even giving some attention to the Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist terminology. His universalism message though received little or no attention from the missionary Christian community. His writings were widely published, revealing his view that so-called heathen Hindus, Buddhists, and Sikhs will go to heaven as surely as a faithful Christian. Sundar, reflecting on an international trip he made to the West during the 1920s, shared his view that many more Indian and Asian people have profound faith than those in the West.[1]\n During Sundar's lifetime, Great Britain ruled India, but he paid little attention to that political situation. He focused his mission on reaching Indian and Tibetan people with the life example and message of Jesus Christ. Reflecting on his way of life, the thought presents that if Jesus Christ could have sent his disciples to India during Jesus' lifetime, they would have lived and worked as Sadhu Sundar Singh had. His life displayed how the lifestyle and message of the New Testament can integrate seamlessly into the life style of a Sikh, Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist holy person.\n Sundar Singh had been born into an important landowning Sikh family in Patiala State in northern India. Sikhs, rejecting Hindu polytheism and Muslim intolerance in the sixteenth century, had become a vigorous nation with a religion of their own. Sundar Singh's mother took him weekly to sit at the feet of a Sadhu, an ascetic holy man, who lived in the jungle some miles away. She also sent him to a Christian mission school where he could learn English.\n The death of Sundar Singh's mother, when he was fourteen years old, plunged him into violence and despair. He turned on the missionaries, persecuted their Christian converts, and ridiculed their faith. In final defiance of their religion, he bought a Bible and burned it page by page in his home compound while his friends watched. Three nights later he went to his room, determining to commit suicide on a railway line.\n Background\nChristianity\nThomas the Apostle\nPantaenus\nProtestantism\nIndian history\nMissions timeline\nChristianity in India\n People\nBartholom\u00e4us Ziegenbalg\nJoshua Marshman\nWilliam Ward\nAlexander Duff\nAnthony Norris Groves\nAmy Carmichael\nE.

Henceforth, he would follow Christ forever, he declared. Still only fifteen, he utterly committed himself to Christ and for the next twenty-five years of his life he witness extensively to Jesus Christ. His father pleaded and demanded that he give up his conviction. When he refused, Sher Singh gave a farewell feast for his son, then denounced him and expelled him from the family. Several hours later, Sundar realized that his food had been poisoned. A nearby Christian community helped him, saving his life.[2]\n On his sixteenth birthday, he participated in a public Christian baptism at the parish church in Simla, a town high in the Himalayan foothills. For some time previously he had been staying at the Christian Leprosy Home at Sabathu, not far from Simla, serving the leprosy patients there. It was to remain one of his most beloved bases and he returned there after his baptism.\n In October 1906, he set out walking a road, wearing a yellow robe and turban. The yellow robe designated the \"uniform\" of a Hindu sadhu, traditionally an ascetic devoted to the gods, who either begged his way along the roads or sat, silent, remote, and often filthy, meditating in the jungle or some lonely place. The young Sundar Singh had also chosen the sadhu's way, as a Christian.\n I am not worthy to follow in the steps of my Lord,\" he is recorded as saying, \"but, like Him, I want no home, no possessions. Like Him I will belong to the road, sharing the suffering of my people, eating with those who will give me shelter, and telling all men of the love of God.[3]\n He at once put his vocation to the test by going back to his home village, Rampur, where he received an unexpectedly warm welcome. The sixteen year old Sadhu set out northward through the Punjab, over the Bannihal Pass into Kashmir, then back through Muslim Afghanistan, and finally into the brigand-infested North-West Frontier and Baluchistan. His thin, yellow robe gave him little protection against the snows, and his feet became torn from the rough tracks.\n After a few months had passed, the small Christian communities of the north referred to him as \"the apostle with the bleeding feet.\"[4] From the villages in the Simla hills, he faced the long line of the snow-clad Himalayas, and the rosy peak of Nanga Parbat. Beyond them lay Tibet, a Buddhist land that missionaries had long failed to penetrate with the gospel. Sundar had felt called to Tibet, and in 1908, at the age of nineteen, he crossed its frontiers for the first time. He encountered poverty and unsanitary conditions far worse than his native home. Sundar went back to Sabathu determined to return the next year.\n He had a great desire: To visit Palestine and re-live some of the experiences in Jesus's life. In 1908, he went to Bombay, hoping to board a convenient ship, but failing to receive a permit from the government, he returned to the north.\n In December 1909, he began training for the Christian ministry at the Anglican college in Lahore. He refrained from forming relationships with fellow students, meeting them at meal times and designated prayer sessions. From the beginning he found himself tormented by fellow students for being \"different.\" Although Singh had been baptized Anglican, he had never learned the teachings and traditions of Anglicanism. His inability to adapt to Anglican life hindered him from fitting in with the routines of academic study. Much in the college course seemed to Singh irrelevant to the gospel as India needed to hear it. In July 1910, after eight months in the college, Singh decided to leave the seminary.\n Singh's withdrawal from ministry training may have been due to remarks made by Bishop Lefroy about the requirements of an ordained Anglican priest. Singh had been told he must discard his sadhu's robe and wear \"respectable\" European clerical dress, use formal Anglican worship, sing English hymns, and never preach outside his parish without special permission. Never again visit Tibet, he asked? That would be, to him, an unthinkable rejection of God's call. He left the college, still dressed in his yellow robe, and in 1912, began his annual trek into Tibet as the winter snows began to melt on the Himalayan tracks and passes.\n In 1912, Sadhu returned with an extraordinary account of finding a three-hundred-year old Christian hermit in a mountain cave-the Maharishi of Kailas, with whom he spent some weeks in deep fellowship. According to Singh, in a town called Rasar, he had been thrown in a dry well full of bones and rotting flesh and left to die. Three days later, a rope descended to him and climbed out to safety.[5] Another time, Singh reported having been rescued by members of the \"Sunnyasi Mission,\" secret disciples of Jesus wearing their Hindu markings, whom he claimed to have found all over India.[6] Legend traces the origins of that brotherhood to one of the Magi at Christ's Nativity and then the second century C.E. disciples of the apostle Thomas circulating in India. The fellowship came to light after William Carey began his missionary work in Serampore. The Maharishi of Kailas experienced ecstatic visions about the secret fellowship that he retold to Sundar Singh, and Singh himself built his spiritual life around visions.[7] Since Singh never keep a diary, and he traveled alone, his success at wining disciples during the hazardous annual Tibetan treks remains unknown.\n In his twenties, Sundar Singh's ministry expanded. His name and picture became familiar throughout the Christian world. He described in terms of a vision a struggle with Satan to retain his humility but, in fact, he had been typically humane, approachable, and humble, with a sense of fun and a love of nature. That, with his \"illustrations\" from ordinary life, gave his addresses great impact. His talks and his personal speech sprang out of profound early morning meditation, especially on the Gospels. In 1918, he made a long tour of South India and Ceylon, and the following year he visited Burma, Malaya, China, and Japan.\n One of the stories from those tours related that he had Christ-given power over wild animals, like the leopard which crept up to him while he stood praying and crouched as he fondled its head, and over evil, typified by the sorcerer who tried to hypnotize him in a railway-carriage and blamed the Bible in the sadhu's pocket for his failure. He claimed even to have power over disease and illness, though he never publicized his gift.\n Sundar Singh had been a Christian universalist; he believed that all people would, eventually, attain salvation. Writing in 1925 he argued:\n If the Divine spark in the soul cannot be destroyed, then we need despair of no sinner\u2026 Since God created men to have fellowship with Himself, they cannot for ever be separated from Him\u2026 After long wandering, and by devious paths, sinful man will at last return to Him in whose Image he was created; for this is his final destiny.[8]\n In 1929, before his final mission, some theology students in Calcutta asked him about the doctrine of eternal punishment. He said: \"There was punishment, but it was not eternal,\" and that \"Everyone after this life would be given a fair chance of making good, and attaining to the measure of fullness the soul was capable of. This might sometimes take ages.\"[8]\n For years, Sundar Singh had wanted to visit Britain. He decided to go when his father, Sher Singh, came to tell him that he too had become a Christian, wishing to pay for his trip to Britain. He visited the West twice, traveling to Britain, the United States, and Australia in 1920, and to Europe again in 1922. Christians of many traditions welcomed him, his words touched the hearts of people dealt with despair in aftermath of World War I. Sundar felt appalled by the materialism, emptiness, and irreligion he found, contrasting it with Asia's awareness of God. Once back in India, he continued his ministry, though his health began to fail.\n In 1923, Sundar Singh made the last of his regular summer visits to Tibet and came back exhausted. His preaching journeys concluded, during the following years, he gave himself to meditation, fellowship, and writing in his own home or those of his friends in the Simla hills.\n In 1929, Sundar determined to make one last journey to Tibet. In April he reached Kalka, a small town below Simla, a prematurely aged figure in his yellow robe among pilgrims and holy men beginning their own trek to one of Hinduism's holy places some miles away. Where he went after that remains unknown. Whether he fell from a precipitous path, died of exhaustion, or reached the mountains, will remain a mystery. Sundar Singh had been seen for the last time. His memory remains as one of the most treasured and formative figures in the development and story of Christ's church in India.\n \nSeveral biographies have been written about Sundar Singh which emphasize his piety, humility and Christian witness. Eric Sharpe surveyed the biographical studies of Sundar Singh and discerned a number of significant discrepancies in chronological details, in the accounts of his Christian conversion, and the accounts of his travels to Tibet. Sharpe indicates that writers in continental Europe, England and the United States of America constructed different portraits of Sundar Singh. He argues that the different portraits disclose much about the way Westerners thought about India in the 1920s and 1930s. Sharpe remarks:  When in the spring of 1920 an Oxford don and his young Indian tutee conceived the idea of writing a book about Sadhu Sundar Singh, it was in their minds to interpret him to the West in terms that the West could grasp and according to a scale of values that the West could affirm.[9] \nSharpe pointed to significant omissions of detail between the biographies of A.J. Appasamy, B.H. Streeter, Janet Lynch-Watson, Cyril J. Davey and Phyllis Thompson. Perhaps the most glaring differences concerns the influence of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1782) and Swedenborgian writers on Sadhu Sundar Singh. Sharpe refers to correspondence between Singh and A.E. Penn, the secretary of the Indian Swedenborgian society, in which Singh stated that he had contacted Swedenborg in the spirit world: \"I saw him several times some years ago, but I did not know his earthly name. His name in the spiritual world is quite different just according to his high position or office and most beautiful character.\"[10] Sharpe also refers back to Singh's endorsement of Swedenborg as recorded by Appasamy:  Swedenborg was a great man, philosopher, scientist, and, above all, seer of clear visions. I often speak with him in my visions. He occupies a high place in the spiritual world \u2026 Having read his books and having come into contact with him in the spiritual world, I can thoroughly recommend him as a great seer.[11] Sundar Singh's correspondence with the Swedish Lutheran bishop Nathan Soderblom in November 1928 further confirms that he claimed visionary contact with Swedenborg.\n For western evangelical Christians, Swedenborg has long been regarded as an unorthodox teacher. Some, such as the Christian apologist Walter Martin, have classified Swedenborg and his followers among the cults.[12] In light of the evangelical rejection of Swedenborg's theology, the omission of Sundar Singh's endorsement of Swedenborg's teachings from evangelical biographies has significance. Singh's confirmation of contact with Swedenborg in the spirit world compounds the difficulty for evangelicals. That visionary form of contact with an unorthodox deceased teacher clashes with the portraits of piety drawn by later evangelical biographers such as Cyril Davey and Phyllis Thompson.\n The results of Sharpe's survey of the various biographies, articles published in Indian and European periodicals, and the extant correspondence of Sundar Singh's, discloses a complex web of western images that portray Singh in contradictory ways: Evangelical missionary, ecstatic visionary, and ascetic pilgrim. Sharpe stated: \"It is time to rescue his memory from oblivion on the one hand and romantic adulation on the other, to protect him from a few of his patrons, and give him his rightful place among those of whom he himself wrote.\"[13]\n As a Christian witness, he had been rejected as well as welcomed, persecuted, and even left for dead. By many missionaries, and even Indian Christian leaders, he had been regarded as a highly eccentric convert, totally out of step with contemporary Christianity as he wandered the roads in his yellow robe and turban. Some of his biographers estimate that, even though he never heard the later vogue-word \"indigenization,\" he had done more than any man in the first half of the twentieth century to establish that \"Jesus belongs to India.\" He made it clear that Christianity constitutes not an imported, alien, foreign religion but is indigenous to Indian needs, aspirations, and faith. He remains one of the permanently significant figures of Indian Christianity.\n All links retrieved August 31, 2019.\n New World Encyclopedia writers and editors rewrote and completed the Wikipedia article\nin accordance with New World Encyclopedia standards.

Dices que hay movil para rato porque no se van a eliminar las que ya son compatibles, te refieres a que seguiran usando las actuales para el 4G o va a pasar todo a la banda 20 y me quedare sin navegar en 4G por la B1 y B3 ? Si eliminaran de golpe las bandas actuales de 4G (B1 y B3), todas las operadoras tendr\u00edan infinidad de quejas de por que ahora no les va el 4g, ademas de que hay pocos m\u00f3viles que soporten la nueva B20, as\u00ed que seguramente seguir\u00e1n funcionando.\nEsto no es como la antena de tv que normalmente se tiene una comunitaria para todo el bloque, sino que en cada comunidad, pueden haber 2 o 3 m\u00f3viles por piso incompatibles\u2026no pueden dejar colgados as\u00ed a los clientes Estas son las bandas en un tel\u00e9fono que me parece bastante interesante:\n4G\nFDD-LTE   B3 / B7\nTD-LTE      B38 / B39 / B40 / B41\n3G\nTD-SCDMA       1900 / 2000MHz\nWCDMA            850 / 1900 / 2100MHz\n2G   GSM         850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900MHz Deduzco que faltan para el 4G la banda B1 y la principal B20. En el 3G creo que falta la B8 y B3 (no s\u00e9 si valdr\u00eda la del 4G) \u00bfEstoy en lo cierto?; Gracias de antemano 1 \u2013 \u00abDeduzco que faltan para el 4G la banda B1\u00bb , seg\u00fan lo que pones la b1 es la 2100 y la tiene, no?\n2 -\u00abEn el 3G creo que falta la B8 y B3\u00bb b8 es la 900 y b3 es la 1800, creo que tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n cubiertas, no?\nLa b20 si que no esta, que m\u00f3vil es\u00bf? Gracias por contestar. Es el nuevo Xiaomi mi 4i que ha empezado a comercializarse en la India. En cuanto pueda, intentar\u00e9 comprarlo.\nLo que puse aparece en la p\u00e1gina oficial y como ten\u00eda la duda ya que est\u00e1n divididas 2G, 3G y 4G, al no poner B1 en el 4g y tampoco B3 y B8 en el 3G, pens\u00e9 que no eran las mismas.\nUn saludo Este m\u00f3vil me interesa mucho a mi, podr\u00edas decirme como funciona cuando lo tengas? gracias! Aqu\u00ed encontr\u00e9 un Unboxing. Si es cierto que pronto sale el Mi4S como se comenta en la red, esperar\u00e1 a ver el precio y las especificaciones por si es gama alta a buen precio.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlZdhBNm2iE Saludos. gracias trini! Estas son las bandas en un tel\u00e9fono que quiero comprar: 2G: GSM(900/1800MHz)\n3G: WCDMA(900/1900/2100MHz)\n4G: FDD-LTE(B1/B3), TDD-LTE(B41)   Tendr\u00eda alg\u00fan problema aqu\u00ed en Espa\u00f1a?? Muchas gracias dani, quieres decir que no entiendes el art\u00edculo y esta mal explicado? saludos Quiere decir que ni se lo ha leido\u2026 era una manera educada de decir lo mismo\u2026;) , pero eso es lo que quer\u00eda decir, juas Lo que no entiendo es porque a la hora de averiguar en que frecuencia esta emitiendo la BTS mas cercana a tu domicilio sea tan complicado. Ni las operadoras telef\u00f3nicas, ni los fabricantes de m\u00f3viles facilitan esa informaci\u00f3n. perdona, que es la bts? he recurrido al Ministerio preguntando esto mismo, aun as\u00ed despues de preguntar en una operadora me ha enviado esto que seguro les ayudar\u00e1 mucho. Saludos.\nhttps://geoportal.minetur.gob.es/VCTEL/vcne.do muchas gracias!!\nosea que el bts son las antenas de movil  que hay repartidas por toda espa\u00f1a, se agradece tu comentario Solo en determinados tel\u00e9fonos mediante un c\u00f3digo y unas aplicaciones que hay para android creo. El art\u00edculo es bastante completo e instructivo, pero hoy por hoy la se\u00f1al 4G se transmite principalmente por la frecuencia de los 1800 mhz, y adem\u00e1s Yoigo no va a migrar a otra frecuencia diferente por que no tiene licencias. Es de esperar que en las zonas m\u00e1s rurales y tur\u00edsticas la se\u00f1al 4G se transmita por los 800 Mhz, pero va a ser un proceso lento.

So what if the BJP was eight MLAs short? \u201cFor Vajubhai, the party\u2019s diktat is final; he never questions it,\u201d Raju Dhruv, the BJP\u2019s spokesperson for the Saurashtra region, says. \u201cI remember his reaction when some of us went to him in 1996 and broke the news that he may have to quit as the all-important finance and revenue minister. He was absolutely cool and all-smiles like always. He told us that he would sincerely perform whatever role the party assigned him.\u201d The sense of loyalty and humour with which Vala is known to negotiate difficult situations is folklore in Gujarat. Vala was made the Gujarat BJP president in 1996\u2014a period of intense internal squabbling within the party. He did not fuss even when asked to become Speaker after having been a Cabinet minister for years. \u201cIt was Vajubhai who called up Narendra Modi in 2002 offering him his constituency, Rajkot II, when Haren Pandya refused to vacate his Ellis Bridge seat [to let Modi, appointed CM in October 2001, contest his first election and join the state Assembly],\u201d recalls Kirit Pathak, a veteran RSS activist and Deputy Registrar at the Saurashtra University in Rajkot. \u201cWelcoming Modi, Vala told him that Rajkot II was a safe seat for the BJP, not for any individual.\u201d  Between 1975 and 2014, when he was appointed Governor by the Modi government, Vala had served as a legislator for seven terms, been a councillor with the Rajkot Municipal Corporation thrice, Rajkot Mayor five times and had also headed the cash-rich Rajkot Nagrik District Cooperative Bank as chairman. \u201cThey may make him a minister, the state party president or the governor, he would never say no or ask for more,\u201d says Pathak. \u201cHe has never sought any of this.\u201d\u00a0 For Vala, nothing is bigger than loyalty to the party, affirms Vallabh Kathiria, the former Rajkot MP and Union minister. \u201cHe knows he will be a zero without the party and he ensures he does not rub anyone on the wrong side,\u201d Kathiria says. \u201cHe has no dedicated fan following per se, although scores of party workers and leaders are on good terms with him.\u201d Given this background, the decision he took in Karnataka, favouring the BJP, is hardly surprising. When he was in the [Gujarat] government, Vala had a way of disguising his \u2018no\u2019 with a \u2018yes\u2019. Many who came to him seeking favours on government-related work would return empty-handed without even realising it.  \u201cMany government works required his approval as the finance minister,\u201d a senior minister in the Gujarat government tells Newslaundry. \u201cSometimes when we were unable to turn down certain influential people, we would send them to Vajubhai. He would deftly divert the subject, and make the visitors laugh uncontrollably to such an extent that they would simply forget why they were meeting him.\u201d That Vala and laughter go hand in hand is a common refrain in Gujarat. Be it in jail, when he was imprisoned during the 1975 Emergency, as a finance minister who presented the state Budget on 12 occasions, or as Speaker of the state Assembly, there would always be peels of laughter when he was around.\u00a0 His way with banter, in the corridors of power or on the streets of his hometown Rajkot, is the stuff of legend. It did not matter if he was a senior minister or now that he is the Governor, he stops by anywhere for a cup of tea with old-timers and cracks jokes. \u201cWe have never seen him with the trappings of a security protocol,\u201d Pathak says. \u201cHe could be found driving a scooter even when was a senior minister. He used to own a yellow \u2018Suvega\u2019 moped before the days of Luna and would be riding around town on it.\u201d Vajubhai\u2019s deep interest in folk literature has helped him hone his sense of humour and instant wit, says senior Rajkot-based Gujarati journalist Jagdish Acharya. \u201cAfter the BJP formed its first government in Gujarat in 1995, Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil remarked that the Lotus may have bloomed but there was no fragrance,\u201d Acharya recalls. \u201cVala\u2019s retort was: \u2018You would need a nose to feel the fragrance, yours has been slit by us (Gujarati proverb \u2018naak kapai javu\u2019 means loss of prestige).\u201d Whether addressing the state Assembly, a public function or a political rally, Vala\u2019s style remained the same, and people never got bored. \u201cVajubhai was an MLA for seven straight terms despite the fact that Karadiya Rajputs make up for only 4,000 voters in the Rajkot II (now Rajkot West) constituency. The seat is dominated by other castes. But he would always say, \u2018I don\u2019t have to worry about the outcome of the election, let my opponent be concerned,\u2019\u201d Pathak says.\u00a0 Pathak recalls a time when a newspaper group had organised a competition of old, forgotten street games in Rajkot. \u201cValubhai not only played with great enthusiasm,\u201d he says, \u201che could also be seen screaming and whistling and shouting like a child. All of us laughed, but it was all natural for Vajubhai.\u201d  He may appear very casual and nonchalant about everything, but he is an able administrator and, through his sense of humour, ensures he does only what he wants to do, Kirit Pathak points out.   \u201cAt the same time, he is never overly serious and concerned about anything. Kaam hua toh thik, nahi hua toh bhi thik (it is okay if the work gets done, it is okay even if it doesn\u2019t),\u201d Kathiria says.  In 1996, then Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda\u2014the father of HD Kumaraswamy, the Congress-JDS alliance\u2019s CM candidate in Karnataka today\u2014dismissed the Gujarat Government in 1996. Vala was the state BJP president then and Suresh Mehta was the chief minister. \u201cHe is not vengeful of anyone or anything,\u201d Kathiria says. \u201cHe has never made enemies and does not have any negative feelings about anyone. Vajubhai would say \u2018char dai ne gayo chhey, lai ne toh nathi gayo ne (even if it is abuses, he has given them, not taken away anything from us),\u201d he says. Political enemies are not personal enemies for Vala apparently. A senior BJP functionary in Rajkot recollects a case of bank fraud involving three senior local Congress leaders. \u201cHe could have got Jayantibhai Kundaliya, chairman of Rajkot Commercial Cooperative Bank chairman, and office-bearers Ashwin Mehta and Mansukh Joshi arrested in a case of Rs 5 crore bank fraud in 2007.\u201d But Vala helped them through the crisis, the BJP worker says. \u201cVajubhai told us: \u2018So what if they are from the Congress, we must get them out since it involves the money of the bank\u2019s depositors.\u2019 Political enemies are not personal enemies, he would say.\u201d Someone who has a solution for every problem, Vajubhai acquired the sobriquet of pani-wala Mayor for solving the severe water crisis in Rajkot during the drought of the mid-eighties. People still remember how he, as the Mayor, got a train full of water to come to the city when all other options had been exhausted. \u2018Paani-wala\u2019 in Gujarati also means a gutsy person.\u00a0 \u00a9 Newslaundry Media Private Limited.
