Kamala Harris (D-CA) has a history of abusing the powers of her office to target and punish Americans she disagrees with. I know firsthand that Harris is one of the biggest threats to First Amendment civil liberties that our country has ever seen because I have been on the receiving end of her unconstitutional abuses of power when she was California\u2019s attorney general. In 2015, after I released undercover videos of taxpayer-funded Planned Parenthood officials trafficking the body parts of live-aborted fetuses, Planned Parenthood was desperate and furious. The organization turned to Harris, its political patron in the California Attorney General\u2019s office, for help to silence me and my message. Though local law enforcement made it clear to Planned Parenthood that the California videos were recorded in public places and were perfectly legal, the abortion provider and its allies within the state Department of Justice conspired to enforce California\u2019s video recording law for the first time ever against newsgathering, in order to punish me for speaking out.` On March 23, 2016, Harris met secretly with several top California Planned Parenthood executives in Los Angeles. The action items from the meeting show they discussed Planned Parenthood\u2019s political agenda in California as well as issues in Harris\u2019s so-called \u201cinvestigation\u201d of me and my coworkers, such as Planned Parenthood\u2019s false claims that my videos made threats against their personnel. Two of the Planned Parenthood officials interviewed in Harris\u2019s probe were present at the meeting.

(Highlight added by Breitbart News for emphasis.) Less than two weeks later, Harris ordered a raid on my home, with explicit instructions to seize the laptops and hard drives I was using to publish my undercover video reporting. April 5, 2016, was an idyllic spring day in southern California. Around lunchtime, I cooked a Greek chicken lunch in my Orange County apartment complex. As I took the grocery scraps out to the parking lot dumpster, the door of a giant white van slid open and a pack of California Department of Justice agents filed out as other law enforcement vehicles swerved into the parking lot with more. They demanded to search my home for evidence of video recordings. I was astounded. The team of eleven armed agents overturned every box, file, and furniture item in my one-bedroom apartment. They seized all of my laptops and hard drives going back to high school. For the first thirty minutes, they refused to let me call my lawyers. Most damningly of all, they thumbed through copies of invoices from Planned Parenthood\u2019s business partners for late-term aborted baby body parts, yet conspicuously left them behind. Apparently Kamala Harris had already decided that anyone selling body parts was innocent, and anyone exposing the sales, guilty.

(Courtesy of David Daleiden) Does anyone doubt that if I had been investigating and publishing undercover video reports on unlicensed gun sales, factory farming, or unsanitary grocery practices, that Harris never would have dreamed of raiding my home? Local news reporters in California tape and publish undercover conversations with corrupt chiropractors in their offices, fraudulent repairmen in private homes, and vendors in unlicensed marijuana dispensaries, but are not prosecuted under the California video recording law. Yet I, who filmed in crowded public restaurants and hotel lobbies, had my home raided and face the first-ever criminal charges for newsgathering under the recording law. Is there any doubt why Kamala Harris subjected me alone among undercover video reporters in California to this selective standard of \u201cjustice\u201d? It is because I dared to question Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry, and to speak the truth: Planned Parenthood sells baby parts. Harris\u2019s deputy prosecutor, Johnette Jauron, admitted in a court filing that the California Department of Justice brought this first-ever case against undercover news reporting solely because of the content of my message, writing that what made me different from other reporters was that my videos \u201cwere edited to enhance their shock value\u201d and that therefore I was \u201cculpable to a greater extent.\u201d That is why I\u2019m suing Kamala Harris in Los Angeles federal court for conspiracy to violate First Amendment civil rights. Obviously, I disagree that my videos were edited for shock value\u2014what the raw footage shows Planned Parenthood doing is shocking enough\u2014but highlighting the significance of your message is part of everyone\u2019s right to free speech. While Harris was busy doing Planned Parenthood\u2019s bidding and silencing the messenger, local law enforcement at the Orange County, California, District Attorney\u2019s Office (OCDA) was using my undercover reporting to investigate Planned Parenthood\u2019s fetal trafficking business partners. In late 2017, in a $7.8 million settlement with the OCDA, DaVinci Biosciences admitted guilt for illegally selling body parts from abortions at Planned Parenthood of Orange & San Bernardino Counties (PPOSBC). The company was shut down and the OCDA credited my undercover work with prompting the successful case. If Harris and Planned Parenthood had their way, the DaVinci company would still be selling baby body parts across the country to this day. By the way, who was one of the Planned Parenthood executives in that meeting with Harris? Dr. Jennefer Russo, the VP Medical Director and top abortion doctor for PPOSBC, who had supplied body parts to DaVinci. I only knew to report the DaVinci-Planned Parenthood relationship to local law enforcement because I recorded Dr. Russo\u2019s admissions about it undercover. It\u2019s not hard to imagine her real reasons for wanting Kamala Harris to investigate me instead.  Because Harris weaponized her office to punish opposing views and cover up the criminality of her patrons, my life has been turned upside down in the past four years. The lives of my friends and colleagues have been irreparably damaged and disrupted. No American should ever have to fear punishment by the State for the content of their speech. I speak for many Americans in all walks of life when I say that I am afraid we are losing the ability to listen to one another. In order to be free to listen, we must be free to speak without the threat of retaliation or censorship from the government. I will never bow to Harris\u2019s radical disrespect for our freedoms to speak and think for ourselves. I hope that all Americans will unite together against her extremist attacks on First Amendment freedoms.

Earlier that year incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson had announced he would not seek reelection, thus making the purpose of the convention to select a new presidential nominee for the Democratic Party.[1] The keynote speaker was Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii.[2] Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine were nominated for president and vice president, respectively. The most contentious issues of the convention were the continuing American military involvement in the Vietnam War and voting reform, particularly expanding the right to vote for draft-age soldiers (age 18) who were unable to vote as the voting age was 21. The convention also marked a turning point where previously idle groups such as youth and minorities became more involved in politics and voting.\n The convention of 1968 was held during a year of riots, political turbulence, and mass civil unrest. The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April of that year inflamed racial tensions to an unprecedented level. King assassination riots in more than 100 cities followed and marked the end of the civil rights movement.[3][4] The convention also followed the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy on June 5.[5] Kennedy's assassination derailed the convention, paving the way for Humphrey. Both Kennedy and Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota had been running for the Democratic nomination at the time. The Humphrey\u2013Muskie ticket would be defeated in the presidential election by the Republican ticket of Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew.\n The Democratic Party, which controlled the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the White House in 1968, was divided. Senator Eugene McCarthy entered the campaign in November 1967, challenging incumbent President Lyndon Johnson for the Democratic nomination. Senator Robert F. Kennedy entered the race in March 1968.\n Johnson, facing dissent within his party, and having only barely won the New Hampshire primary, announced that he would not seek re-election on March 31, 1968.[6] The Wisconsin primary was scheduled for April 2, and public opinion polls showed Johnson as third in the race, behind McCarthy and Kennedy.[7] For an incumbent president to come in third in a primary would be unprecedented humiliation, and for Johnson it was better to drop out of the race on March 31 rather than to come in third in the Wisconsin primary.[7] In his television address announcing his withdrawal from the presidential race, Johnson also announced the United States would stop bombing North Vietnam north of the 19th parallel and was willing to open peace talks.[8] On April 27 Vice President Hubert Humphrey entered into the race but did not compete in any primaries; instead he inherited the delegates previously pledged to Johnson and then collected delegates in caucus states, especially in caucuses controlled by local Democratic bosses.\n Peace talks had begun in Paris on May 13, 1968, but almost immediately became deadlocked as Xuan Thuy, the head of the North Vietnamese delegation, demanded that the U.S. give a promise to unconditionally stop bombing North Vietnam, a demand rejected by W. Averell Harriman of the American delegation.[9] Like many other newly independent nations in Africa and Asia, the North Vietnamese were extremely sensitive about threats to their newly won sovereignty and independence.[10] Under French colonial rule, the French had carried out their policy of mission civilisatrice, under which the Vietnamese were to be \"civilized\" by being assimilated into the French language and culture, which had caused an intense Vietnamese nationalist reaction. Ho Chi Minh and all of the other Vietnamese communist leaders had spent decades struggling against the French, and he, together with the rest of the Politburo, felt that the U.S. dropping bombs on North Vietnam was a violation of their country's sovereignty.[10] In a way that many Americans had trouble understanding, Ho felt that to negotiate with the Americans reserving the right to bomb North Vietnam whenever they wanted to would diminish the country's independence.[10] Right from the moment Operation Rolling Thunder started in 1965, the North Vietnamese had demanded the U.S. unconditionally halt the bombing as the first step towards peace.[10] Though the North Vietnamese had agreed to talk in 1968, it soon became apparent that no progress would be possible in Paris until the U.S. promised to unconditionally cease bombing, as the talks floundered on that issue all through the spring, summer and fall of 1968.[9]\n After Kennedy's assassination on June 5, the Democratic Party's divisions grew.[5] At the moment of Kennedy's death the delegate count stood at Humphrey 561.5, Kennedy 393.5, McCarthy 258.[11] Kennedy's murder left his delegates uncommitted. Support within the Democratic Party was divided between McCarthy, who ran a decidedly anti-war campaign and was seen as the peace candidate;[12] Humphrey, who was seen as the candidate representing the Johnson point of view;[13] and Senator George McGovern, who appealed to some of the Kennedy supporters.\n Before the start of the convention on August 26, several states had competing slates of delegates attempting to be seated at the convention. Some of these delegate credential fights went to the floor of the convention on August 26, where votes were held to determine which slates of delegates representing Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and North Carolina would be seated at the convention. The more racially integrated challenging slate from Texas was defeated.[14]\n The convention was among the most tense and confrontational political conventions ever in American history. The convention's host, Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago, had refused permission for \"anti-patriotic\" groups to demonstrate at the convention, and had the International Amphitheatre, where the convention was being held, ringed with barbed wire while putting the 11,000 officers of the Chicago Police Department on twelve-hour shifts.[15] In addition, there were 6,000 armed men from the Illinois National Guard called up to guard the International Amphitheatre, giving the feeling that Chicago was a city under siege.[16] Todd Gitlin, one of the leaders of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) protest group, was highly worried about the potential for violence, and at a speech paraphrased a lyric from a song, \"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)\", saying: \"If you're going to Chicago, be sure to wear some armor in your hair\".[16]\n Johnson had wanted the Democratic convention to be held in Houston, but Daley had successfully lobbied the president to have the convention held in Chicago, as he wanted the convention held in his city to showcase to the national media how successful he had been since he started serving as mayor in 1955.[17] Daley, a man who ruled Chicago in an extremely authoritarian style, felt very strongly that the protesters were going to ruin what was supposed to be his moment of triumph and was determined to stop them.[17] One of Daley's aides told the media that the anti-war demonstrators were \"revolutionaries bent on the destruction of America\".[18] The mayor attempted to impose restrictions to keep protesters as far away as possible from the convention, on their numbers, and on their activities, making it very clear that he much preferred that no protesters come to his city.[19] Two of the SDS leaders, Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis, had planned to keep their protests peaceful, but the lack of permits for protesting together with thinly veiled threats that the Chicago police would beat demonstrators made it clear that there would probably be violence.[16] When the media reported that Daley had given orders to the police to restrict the activities of Democratic delegates loyal to McCarthy, Daley was enraged, giving a rambling press conference saying, \"This is a vicious attack on this city and its mayor\".[20]\n The leaders of the Yippies (an acronym for Youth International Party), Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, specialized in outlandish, bizarre rhetoric that attracted maximum media attention, and Daley took many of their more outrageous threats seriously.[21] To sabotage the convention, Hoffman and Rubin announced that they were sending \"super-hot\" hippie girls to seduce the delegates and give them LSD; that they were going to put LSD into the water supply of the International Amphitheatre; and were sending well-endowed hippie \"studs\" to seduce the wives and daughters of the delegates.[21] In a typical press release, Hoffman and Rubin stated about their plans in Chicago: \"We are dirty, smelly, grimy and foul...we will piss and shit and fuck in public...we will be constantly stoned or tripping on every drug known to man\".[21] Daley took all of this seriously, and much of the excessive security was due to his belief that the Yippies were going to disrupt the convention in the manner that they had proclaimed they would.[21]\n Daley's heavy-handed security measures incensed the media. Walter Cronkite complained of \"a totally unwarranted restriction of free and rapid access to information.\"[20] Eric Sevareid stated that Chicago \"runs the city of Prague a close second right now as the world's least attractive tourist destination\".[20] Intelligence agents had infiltrated the protesters, including agents from the Central Intelligence Agency, who \u2013 contrary to American law \u2013 had been sent to spy upon Americans in the United States.[18] Just before the convention started, Hoffman and Rubin showed up at the Civic Center Plaza to free the pig named Pigasus whom they had nominated as the Democratic candidate, leading the police to seize Pigasus while arresting Rubin and five others.[16] The Pigasus incident was captured live on television. Over 10,000 people had arrived in Chicago to protest against the Vietnam War, and the city in late August was much on the edge.[18] The Chicago police raided the mostly black neighborhoods of South Chicago to stage mass arrests of the Blackstone Rangers, a black power group that was alleged to be planning to assassinate Humphrey.[22] When Humphrey arrived in Chicago, Daley was not at the airport to greet him, instead sending a police bagpipe band to welcome him.[23] As Humphrey was driven to his room at the Conrad Hilton hotel, he noticed that no one in the streets cheered him, in marked contrast to the arrival of McCarthy who was greeted by 5,000 cheering supporters when he landed in Chicago.[23]\n Within the convention itself, tensions were much evident between pro-war and anti-war Democrats. One of the principal issues at the peace talks in Paris was the North Vietnamese demand that the U.S. unconditionally cease bombing North Vietnam as an essential precondition before discussing other matters. The more dovish Democrats favored accepting the North Vietnamese demand while more hawkish Democrats demanded the North Vietnamese promise not to send any men down the Ho Chi Minh Trail as their precondition for a bombing pause, a demand that the North Vietnamese rejected.[24] Humphrey, confronted with a divided party, attempted to craft a party platform that would appeal to both factions, writing a platform calling for a bombing pause that \"took into account, most importantly, the risk to American troops as well as the response from Hanoi.\"[25] Humphrey's platform held out the possibility of a complete bombing pause without explicitly saying so, though Humphrey's statements suggested that if elected president he would order a complete bombing pause.[18] Anticipating the \"Vietnamization\" strategy later carried out by Richard Nixon, Humphrey's platform called for the \"de-Americanization\" of the war as it called for the U.S. to gradually pull out American troops from South Vietnam and to shift the burden of fighting the war back to the South Vietnamese.[26]\n Humphrey previewed his platform to two of Johnson's more hawkish advisers, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and National Security Advisor Walt Whitman Rostow.[15] Rostow very reluctantly gave his approval while Rusk told Humphrey, \"We can live with this, Hubert.\"[15] Johnson, despite not attending the convention as he had chosen to decamp to his ranch in Texas instead, maintained a very tight control over the proceedings and angrily rejected Humphrey's compromise peace plank as a personal affront, telling Humphrey in a telephone call to change his plank at once.[18][15] When Humphrey protested that, \"Dean Rusk approved it,\" Johnson shouted over the phone: \"That's not the way I hear it. Well, this just undercuts our whole policy, and by God, the Democratic Party ought not to be doing that to me, and you ought not to be doing it. You've been a part of the policy.\"[15] To put further pressure on Humphrey, Johnson called up General Creighton Abrams, the commander of the U.S forces in Vietnam, to ask if a complete bombing pause would endanger the lives of American soldiers; Abrams, unaware that Johnson's question was really about an intra-Democratic dispute, replied that it would.[15] Johnson, who also received Abrams's answer to his question in writing, passed on a copy to Hale Boggs, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), who in turn showed it to various leading delegates to show how reckless and \"unpatriotic\" Humphrey was in contemplating a bombing pause.[15] Faced with Johnson's fury, Humphrey gave in and accepted a plank that was more to Johnson's liking.[15] Johnson always had a strong contempt for Humphrey, a man whom he liked to bully, telling Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford that he would respect Humphrey more if only he \"showed he had some balls.\"[27] Through some of Humphrey's advisors counseled him to defy the lame-duck president, Humphrey resignedly stated: \"Well, it would not look like an act based on principle or conviction; it would seem like a gimmick. It would seem strange. And it would enrage the president.\"[28]\n The platform that Humphrey had written on Johnson's dictation was introduced onto the floor of the convention and prompted a passionate three-hour long debate on the floor, as anti-war Democrats were unrelenting in their objections.[29] The platform was passed by a narrow margin, with 1,567 delegates voting for the platform while 1,041 voted against.[15] When the platform was passed, the delegation from New York put on black armbands and began to sing \"We Shall Overcome\" in protest.[29] Humphrey later stated that his biggest mistake of the 1968 election was to have given in to Johnson, contending that if he stuck to his original platform it would have differentiated himself enough from Johnson to give him a lead in the polls.[29] Humphrey always believed that if he gave the speech that he planned to give in Chicago and later gave in Salt Lake City on September 30, 1968, calling for an unconditional bombing pause of North Vietnam as \"an acceptable risk for peace,\" that he would have won the election.[29]\n Humphrey also complained that the convention had been held in late August to coincide with Johnson's birthday, which cost him a month to organize, and would preferred to have the convention held in July.[30] Complicating the election was the third party candidacy of Alabama governor George Wallace, who ran on a white supremacist platform promising to undo all of the changes wrought by the Civil Rights Movement. Traditionally, conservative whites in the South had voted as a bloc for the Democrats, but in the 1960s many were starting to move away from the Democratic Party. Nixon had embarked upon his Southern strategy of wooing conservative Southern whites over to the Republicans, but Wallace (who had the advantage of always appearing more extreme on racial questions than was possible for Nixon) threatened to upend the Southern strategy. Johnson had wanted Humphrey to nominate as his running mate a conservative white Southern Democrat who might prevent Southern whites from voting for Wallace or Nixon, bringing back to the Democratic Party a group who had been one of the most loyal Democratic voting blocs for over a century.[27] Humphrey managed to muster up the courage to defy Johnson and choose as his running mate Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine, a dignified, centrist Democrat.[27]\n Humphrey had been well known as a liberal supporter of the Civil Rights Movement, and he felt that with Nixon and Wallace competing for the conservative white Southern voters there was no realistic opportunity for him to appeal to that group. In 1948, Humphrey, at that time the mayor of Minneapolis, had first come to national attention when he delivered a speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention denouncing racial injustices in the South.[31] However, over the protests of liberals, Humphrey did not resist Johnson's decision to seat several all-white delegations from several Southern states despite the complaints that Black Americans (and in the case of the Texas delegation, Mexican-Americans) had been consciously excluded.[32]\n Johnson distrusted Humphrey and had the Federal Bureau of Investigation illegally tap his telephones to find out what the vice president was planning to do.[15] At the same time, though Johnson had announced that he had dropped out of the election, he sent his friend John Connally, the Governor of Texas, to meet with other Democratic governors of southern states attending the convention to inquire if they would be willing to support nominating Johnson to be the Democratic candidate after all.[15] Daley, a strong Johnson supporter, was enthusiastic about having Johnson re-enter the election.[15] Daley, who was apparently oblivious of the depth of the antagonism between Johnson and the Kennedy family, favored having Senator Ted Kennedy serve as Johnson's running mate, saying that a \"LBJ-TEK\" ticket would easily win the election.[15] Daley was so committed to having Johnson re-enter the race that he had secretly printed up signs reading \"We Love LBJ\" to be waved about by the delegates when he was to announce that Johnson return to the race.[33] He also called up Kennedy to discuss his plans, but Kennedy, who was seriously depressed after the assassination of his brother Robert, was not interested in attending the convention nor in being a candidate.[33] It remains unclear if Johnson was actually serious about re-entering the presidential race, or if he was merely using the prospect of running again as a way to keep Humphrey from straying too far from his policies.[15] Regardless of what Johnson was intending, Connally had to tell his fellow Texan that general feeling about Johnson being the Democratic candidate in 1968 was, \"No way!\"[15]\n The security measures imposed by Daley had been so intense that it was not possible to walk across the convention floor without jostling other delegates, which added to the tensions as dovish and hawkish Democrats fiercely argued about whether to accept Johnson's war plank to the platform. All of it was captured live on national television.[34] Pro-war Democrats challenged the right of the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who was serving as the floor manager for McCarthy, to be there and sought to have him expelled from the convention.[34] Inside the convention hall were televisions showing the police beating and clubbing demonstrators outside, which increased the tension.[34] Robert Maytag, the chairman of the Colorado delegation asked: \"Is there any rule under which Mayor Daley can be compelled to suspend the police state terror being perpetrated at this minute on kids in front of the Conrad Hilton [hotel]?\"[35] Daley's face flushed with anger while his supporters began to boo Maytag.[35] On the convention floor, Senator Abraham Ribicoff rose to give a speech nominating McGovern as the Democratic candidate.[36] During his speech, Ribicoff pointed to Daley and said: \"With George McGovern, we wouldn't have Gestapo tactics on the streets of Chicago.\"[36] Pandemonium broke out in the convention hall, with some delegates praising Ribicoff while others denounced him. Daley rose up to scream at the top of his voice at Ribicoff: \"Fuck you, you Jew son of bitch! You lousy motherfucker! Go home!\"[36] Despite Daley's foul-mouthed antisemitic tirade, Ribicoff merely said: \"How hard it is to accept the truth. How hard it is.\"[36] Four Chicago city officials, known Daley loyalists, jumped on the stage to usher Ribicoff away, and Daley's bodyguards surrounded him, though from what threat they protected him remained unclear.[35]\n The convention was noteworthy for leading to a significant change in the rules governing delegate selection, largely overshadowed at the time by the rioting in Chicago.[37] The McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission, chaired by Senator McGovern, officially known as the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, was appointed to examine how delegates were selected.[37] The commission documented that in many places in America the Democratic Party was \"an autocratic, authoritarian organization\" that engaged in the \"shameful exploitation of the voter.\"[37]\n In the end, the Democratic Party nominated Humphrey. The delegates had defeated the peace plank by 1,567\u00be to 1,041\u00bc.[38] The loss was perceived to be the result of Johnson and Daley influencing behind the scenes.[38] Humphrey, who had not entered any of the thirteen state primary elections, won the Democratic nomination shortly after midnight, and many delegates shouted, \"No! No!\" when his victory was announced.[36] The nomination was watched by 89 million Americans.[39] As a sign of racial reconciliation, Humphrey had intended for his nomination to be seconded by a speech by Carl Stokes, the Black mayor of Cleveland, Ohio.[39] Stokes's speech was not shown on live national television as planned, as the networks instead broadcast live the \"Battle of Michigan Avenue\" that was taking place in front of the Conrad Hilton hotel.[39]\u00a0Humphrey went on to lose the 1968 presidential election to the Republican Richard Nixon.[40]\n Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota\n Senator Robert F.

This is the kind of thing that has been going on outside the hall, this is the first time we've had it happen inside the hall. We ... I'm sorry to be out of breath, but somebody belted me in the stomach during that. What happened is a Georgia delegate, at least he had a Georgia delegate sign on, was being hauled out of the hall. We tried to talk to him to see why, who he was, what the situation was, and at that instant the security people, well as you can see, put me on the deck. I didn't do very well.\"[43]  An angry Cronkite tersely replied, \"I think we've got a bunch of thugs here, Dan.\"\n Daley intended to showcase his and the city's achievements to national Democrats and the news media. Instead, the proceedings became notorious for the large number of demonstrators and the use of force by the Chicago police during what was supposed to be, in the words of Yippie activist organizers, \"A Festival of Life.\"[4] Rioting took place by the Chicago Police Department and the Illinois National Guard against the demonstrators. The disturbances were well publicized by the mass media, with some journalists and reporters being caught up in the violence. Network newsmen Dan Rather, Mike Wallace, and Edwin Newman were assaulted by the Chicago police while inside the convention hall.[44]\n The Democratic National Convention had been held in Chicago twelve years earlier.[45] Daley had played an integral role in the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960.[45] In 1968, however, it did not seem that Daley had maintained the clout which would allow him to bring out the voters again to produce a Democratic victory as he had in 1960.\n On October 7, 1967, Daley and Johnson had a private meeting at a fund raiser for Johnson's re-election campaign, with an entry fee of one thousand dollars per plate (approximately $7,200 in 2016 dollars). During the meeting, Daley explained to the president that there had been a disappointing showing of Democrats in the 1966 congressional races, and the president might lose the swing state of Illinois with its 26 electoral votes if the convention were not held there.[46] Johnson's pro-war policies had already created a great division within the party; he hoped that the selection of Chicago for the convention would eliminate further conflict with opposition.[47] The DNC head for selecting the location was David Wilentz of New Jersey, who gave the official reason for choosing Chicago as, \"It is centrally located geographically which will reduce transportation costs and because it has been the site of national conventions for both Parties in the past and is therefore attuned to holding them.\" The conversation between Johnson and Daley was leaked to the press and published in the Chicago Tribune and several other papers.[47]\n In preparation for the convention, Daley had walls erected along the roads to the Amphitheatre through his own neighborhood of Bridgeport to obscure from sight rundown housing in the neighborhood.[48]\n In 1968, the Yippies and the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (MOBE) had already begun planning a youth festival in Chicago to coincide with the convention. They were not alone, as other groups such as the SDS would also make their presence known.[49] When asked about anti-war demonstrators, Daley repeated to reporters that \"no thousands will come to our city and take over our streets, our city, our convention.\"[50] 10,000 demonstrators gathered in Chicago for the convention, where they were met by 23,000 police and National Guardsmen.[40] Daley also thought that one way to prevent demonstrators from coming to Chicago was to refuse to grant permits which would allow for people to protest legally.[51]\n After the violence at the convention, Daley said his primary reason for calling in so many Guardsmen and police was reports he received indicating the existence of plots to assassinate many Democratic Party leaders, including himself.[52]\n While several protests had taken place before serious violence occurred, the events headed by the Yippies were not without satire. Surrounded by reporters on August 23, 1968, Yippie leader Rubin, folk singer Phil Ochs, and other activists held their own presidential nominating convention with their candidate Pigasus, an actual pig. When the Yippies paraded Pigasus at the Civic Center, ten policemen arrested Ochs, Rubin, Pigasus, and six others. This resulted in a great deal of media attention for Pigasus.[53]\n A peaceful demonstration was held in Lincoln Park led by Rubin and Hoffman, with the Yippie leaders calling the demonstrators to respect the 11\u00a0pm curfew.[16] The Beatnik poet Allen Ginsberg ended the demonstration by chanting \"Om\".[16] The next day was supposed to be the \"Festival of Life\" in Lincoln Park, but the police confiscated the truck upon which a rock band was to play.[16] The mood soon turned ugly with the demonstrators calling the police, \"Motherfuckers!\" while the police shouted, \"Kill the Commies!\"[54] The police fired tear gas into the crowd while beating up the photographers and journalists present.[54] Tom Hayden, one of the leaders of the SDS and co-organizer of the protests, was arrested for the first time.\n The next day, what was billed as \"Unbirthday Party\" for President Johnson was planned to be held in Lincoln Park.[54] Hayden, who had been freed on bail after his arrest the previous day, attended the \"Unbirthday Party\". He was recognized by a policeman, Constable Ralph Bell, who beat him and then arrested him for violating his bail conditions.[54] Also attending the \"Unbirthday Party\" were Rubin and Bobby Seale of the Black Panther Party, who both called for \"roasting pigs\" in their speeches.[54] In the evening, a demonstration was held at Grant Park opposite the Hilton Hotel, which was peaceful as bands such as Peter, Paul and Mary played folk music.[54] When 600 Illinois National Guardsmen appeared, Hayden, who had been bailed out a second time, picked up his megaphone to shout that everybody should go home.[54]\n On August 28, 1968, around 10,000 protesters gathered in Grant Park for the demonstration, intending to march to the International Amphitheatre where the convention was being held.[18] At approximately 3:30\u00a0p.m., a young man lowered the American flag that was at the park.[38] The police broke through the crowd and began beating the young man, while the crowd pelted the police with food, rocks, and chunks of concrete.[55] The chants of some of the protesters shifted from, \"Hell no, we won't go!\" to, \"Pigs are whores!\"[56]\n Hayden encouraged protesters to move out of the park to ensure that if the police used tear gas on them, it would have to be done throughout the city.[57] The police soon gained the upper hand after firing tear gas and chased the demonstrators down the streets, beating them with clubs and rifle butts before arresting them.[18] The amount of tear gas used to suppress the protesters was so great that it made its way to the Conrad Hilton, where it disturbed Humphrey while in his shower.[56] The police sprayed demonstrators and bystanders with mace and were taunted by some protesters with chants of, \"Kill, kill, kill!\"[58] The police responded by shouting, \"Get out of here, you cocksuckers!\".[36] Police indiscriminately attacked all who were present, regardless if they involved in the demonstrations or not.[36] Dick Gregory, the comedian who attended the protests, told the crowd that the police were merely following the orders of Daley and \"the crooks downtown\".[36]\n The MOBE leaders then decided to march down Michigan Avenue to the Conrad Hilton hotel, where many of the Democratic delegates were staying.[36] The Illinois National Guard guarding the hotel fired tear gas while the police moved in to beat the demonstrators.[36] The police assault in front of the hotel during the evening of August 28 became the most famous image of the Chicago demonstrations of 1968. The entire event took place live under television lights for seventeen minutes with the crowd chanting, \"The whole world is watching\".[56] Samuel Brown, one of the organizers for Senator McCarthy, lamented the violence, saying: \"Instead of nice young people ringing doorbells, the public saw the image of mobs shouting obscenities and disrupting the city\".[18] Brown stated the demonstrations at Chicago had been a disaster for the anti-war movement, as the American people saw the protesters as the trouble-makers and the heavy-handed police response as justified.[18] The general feeling at the time was the hippies were intent upon destroying everything good in America and the Chicago police had acted correctly in beating such dangerous anti-social types bloody.[21]\u00a0In a telephone call to President Johnson on Saturday, September 7, 1968, Daley described some of the activity undertaken by the elements of the protesters, which he described as \"Professional Trouble Makers\", these activities included the burning of the American Flag, raising of the Viet Cong flag and throwing both manure and urine at the police.[59]\n \nIn its report Rights in Conflict (better known as the Walker Report), the Chicago Study Team that investigated the violent clashes between police and protesters at the convention stated that the police response was characterized by:  unrestrained and indiscriminate police violence on many occasions, particularly at night. That violence was made all the more shocking by the fact that it was often inflicted upon persons who had broken no law, disobeyed no order, made no threat. These included peaceful demonstrators, onlookers, and large numbers of residents who were simply passing through, or happened to live in, the areas where confrontations were occurring.[60][61]\n The Walker Report, \"headed by an independent observer from Los Angeles police \u2013 concluded that: 'Individual policemen, and lots of them, committed violent acts far in excess of the requisite force for crowd dispersal or arrest. To read dispassionately the hundreds of statements describing at firsthand the events of Sunday and Monday nights is to become convinced of the presence of what can only be called a police riot.'\"[62]\n Senator Ribicoff used his nominating speech for McGovern to report the violence going on outside the convention hall and said that, \"With George McGovern as President of the United States, we wouldn't have to have Gestapo tactics in the streets of Chicago!\"[65] Daley responded to his remark with something unintelligible through the television sound, although lip-readers throughout America claimed to have observed him shouting, \"Fuck you, you Jew son of a bitch!\" Defenders of the mayor would later claim that he was calling Ribicoff a faker,[63][64] a charge denied by Daley and refuted by Mike Royko's reporting.[66] Ribicoff replied: \"How hard it is to accept the truth!\" That night, NBC News had been switching back and forth between images of the violence to the festivities over Humphrey's victory in the convention hall, highlighting the division in the Democratic Party.[67]\n According to The Guardian, \"[a]fter four days and nights of violence, 668 people had been arrested, 425 demonstrators were treated at temporary medical facilities, 200 were treated on the spot, 400 given first aid for tear gas exposure and 110 went to hospital. A total of 192 police officers were injured.\"[68]\n After the Chicago protests, some demonstrators believed the majority of Americans would side with them over what had happened in Chicago, especially because of police behavior.[68] The controversy over the war in Vietnam overshadowed their cause.[44] Daley shared he had received 135,000 letters supporting his actions and only 5,000 condemning them. Public opinion polls demonstrated that the majority of Americans supported the mayor's tactics.[69] It was often commented through the popular media that on that evening, America decided to vote for Richard Nixon.[70]\n After the convention, which had very publicly exposed the fault-lines between hawkish and dovish Democrats, Humphrey was 22 points behind Nixon in the polls.[30] By contrast to the violence and chaos in Chicago, the Republican convention in Miami had been a model of order and unity, which made Nixon appear better qualified to be president as even Humphrey himself conceded in private.[30]\n On September 30, 1968, Humphrey gave a speech in Salt Lake City that he had intended to deliver at the convention in Chicago, saying he was willing to unconditionally stop the bombing of North Vietnam to break the deadlock in the peace talks in Paris.[71] At this point, Humphrey, who was behind in the polls, saw his numbers began to rise; Nixon was certainly concerned in October 1968 that he might lose the election.[72] By late October 1968, Humphrey had a slight lead with 44% intending to vote for him compared to 43% for Nixon.[73] The election of 1968 was one of the closest ever in American history with Nixon winning 31.7 million votes, Humphrey 31.2 million votes and Wallace 10 million votes.[73]\n A grand jury charged eight defendants with conspiracy, crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot, and other federal crimes following the 1968 Democratic National Convention. The defendants became known as the Chicago Eight: Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, Bobby Seale, Rennie Davis, David Dellinger, John Froines, and Lee Weiner.[74] During the trial, the case against Bobby Seale was declared a mistrial, and the Chicago Eight then became the Chicago Seven. Demonstrations were held daily during the trial, organized by the MOBE, the Young Lords led by Jose Cha Cha Jimenez, and the local Black Panther Party led by Chairman Fred Hampton.[citation needed] In February 1970, five of the seven defendants were convicted of crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot, and all were acquitted of conspiracy. Froines and Weiner were acquitted on all charges.\n While the jury was deliberating, Judge Julius Hoffman sentenced the defendants and their attorneys to jail terms ranging from 2+1\u20442 months to 4 years for contempt of court.[75] In 1972, the convictions were reversed on appeal, and the government declined to bring the case to trial again.[74][76]\n In response to the party disunity and electoral failure that came out of the convention, the party established the 'Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection' (informally known as the 'McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission'),[77] to examine current rules on the ways candidates were nominated and make recommendations designed to broaden participation and enable better representation for minorities and others who were underrepresented. The commission established more open procedures and affirmative action guidelines for selecting delegates. The changes imposed by the commission required that the number of delegates who were Black, women, Hispanic and between the ages of 18-30 reflected the proportion of the people in those groups in every congressional district.[37]\n In addition the commission required all delegate selection procedures to be open; party leaders could no longer handpick the delegates in secret.[78] The changes brought about by the commission ended the ability of local bosses who headed political machines such as Daley to ensure delegations that were subservient to them attended conventions.[37] The rule changes brought by the commission also marked the beginning of end of the Democratic delegations that were almost entirely male and usually entirely white, ensuring in the future Democratic delegations would be more diverse.[37] An unforeseen result of these rules was a large shift toward state presidential primaries. Prior to the reforms, Democrats in two-thirds of the states used state conventions to choose convention delegates. In the post-reform era, over three-quarters of the states use primary elections to choose delegates, and over 80% of convention delegates are selected in these primaries.[79]\n United States Senator, South Dakota, 1963\u20131981\n"], "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden": [" \n Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. (/\u02c8ba\u026ad\u0259n/ (listen) BY-d\u0259n; born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who is the 46th and current president of the United States. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama, and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009.\n Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He studied at the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history after he was elected to the United States Senate from Delaware in 1972, at age 29. Biden was the chair or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years. He chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1987 to 1995; led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act; and oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.\n Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008, before becoming Obama's vice president after they won the 2008 presidential election. During his two terms as vice president, Biden frequently represented the administration in negotiations with congressional Republicans and was a close counselor to President Obama. \n Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbent Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. He became the oldest president in U.S. history and the first to have a female vice president. Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act to address the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession; the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which incorporated aspects of his American Jobs Plan; the Inflation Reduction Act covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform, which reduced and comprehensively reworked the proposed Build Back Better Act supporting his agenda; and the Respect for Marriage Act, which expanded protections for interracial and same-sex marriages. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, he restored the U.S. into the Paris Agreement on climate change. He completed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. He responded to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine.\n Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,[1] at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania,[2] to Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Biden (n\u00e9e Finnegan) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.[3][4] The oldest child in a Catholic family, he has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James.[5] Jean was of Irish descent,[6][7][8] while Joseph Sr. had English, Irish, and French Huguenot ancestry.[9][10][8] Biden's paternal line has been traced to stonemason William Biden, who was born in 1789 in Westbourne, England, and emigrated to Maryland in the United States by 1820.[11]\n Biden's father had been wealthy and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of Garden City in the fall of 1946,[12] but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old,[13][14][15] and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents in Scranton.[16] Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Biden's father could not find steady work.[17] Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten,[18] the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before moving to a house in nearby Mayfield.[19][20][14][16] Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.[16][17][21]\n At Archmere Academy in Claymont,[22] Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team.[16][23] Though a poor student, he was class president in his junior and senior years.[24][25] He graduated in 1961.[24] At the University of Delaware in Newark, Biden briefly played freshman football,[26][27] and, as an unexceptional student,[28] earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with a double major in history and political science and a minor in English.[29][30]\n Biden has a stutter, which has improved since his early twenties.[31] He says he reduced it by reciting poetry before a mirror,[25][32] but some observers suggested it affected his performance in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential debates.[33][34][35]\n On August 27, 1966, Biden married Neilia Hunter (1942\u20131972), a student at Syracuse University,[29] after overcoming her parents' reluctance for her to wed a Roman Catholic. Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles, New York.[36] They had three children: Joseph R. \"Beau\" Biden III (1969\u20132015), Robert Hunter Biden (born 1970), and Naomi Christina \"Amy\" Biden (1971\u20131972).[29]\n In 1968, Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law, ranked 76th in his class of 85, after failing a course due to an acknowledged \"mistake\" when he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school.[28] He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969.[1]\n Biden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Nixon's conduct of the war.[37] While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments, at a time when most draftees were sent to the Vietnam War. In 1968, based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had \"asthma as a teenager\" was the reason for the deferment.[38]\n In 1968, Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett and, he later said, \"thought of myself as a Republican\".[39][40] He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry's conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968.[39] Biden was recruited by local Republicans but registered as an Independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon.[39]\n In 1969, Biden practiced law, first as a public defender and then at a firm headed by a locally active Democrat[41][39] who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party;[42] Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat.[39] He and another attorney also formed a law firm.[41] Corporate law, however, did not appeal to him, and criminal law did not pay well.[16] He supplemented his income by managing properties.[43]\n In 1970, Biden ran for the 4th district seat on the New Castle County Council on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs.[44][41][45] The seat had been held by Republican Henry R. Folsom, who was running in the 5th District following a reapportionment of council districts.[46][47][48] Biden won the general election by defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick, and took office on January 5, 1971.[49][50] He served until January 1, 1973, and was succeeded by Democrat Francis R. Swift.[51][52][53][54] During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods.[55]\n In 1972, Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs, and with minimal campaign funds, he was given no chance of winning.[41][16] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,[56] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.[43] He received help from the AFL\u2013CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell.[41] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care, and public dissatisfaction with \"politics as usual\".[41][56] A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points,[41] but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage[21] and he won with 50.5 percent of the vote.[56] At the time of his election, he was 29 years old, but he reached the constitutionally required age of 30 before he was sworn in as Senator.[57]\n On December 18, 1972, a few weeks after Biden was elected senator, his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware.[29][58] Neilia's station wagon was hit by a semi-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection. Their sons Beau (aged\u00a03) and Hunter (aged\u00a02) were taken to the hospital in fair condition, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries.[59] Biden considered resigning to care for them,[21] but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to.[60] The accident filled Biden with anger and religious doubt. He wrote that he \"felt God had played a horrible trick\" on him,[61] and he had trouble focusing on work.[62][63]\n After the truck driver passed away in 1999, Biden in 2001 and 2007 accused the truck driver of drinking before the crash, even though the truck driver was never charged, and the chief prosecutor investigating the case stated that there was no evidence of drunk driving.[64] In 2008, Biden's spokesman said that Biden \"fully accepts\" that allegations of drunk driving were \"false\".[65] The truck driver's daughter said that Biden called her after a 2009 media report to apologize \"for hurting my family in any way\".[66]\n Biden met the teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs in 1975 on a blind date.[67] They married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977.[68][69] They spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic.[70][71] Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life.[72] They are Roman Catholics and attend Mass at St. Joseph's on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware.[73] Their daughter Ashley Biden (born 1981)[29] is a social worker. She is married to physician Howard Krein.[74] Beau Biden became an Army Judge Advocate in Iraq and later Delaware Attorney General[75] before dying of brain cancer in 2015.[76][77] Hunter Biden is a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser.[78]\n From 1991 to 2008, as an adjunct professor, Biden co-taught a seminar on constitutional law at Widener University School of Law.[79][80] The seminar often had a waiting list. Biden sometimes flew back from overseas to teach the class.[81][82][83][84]\n In January 1973, secretary of the Senate Francis R. Valeo swore Biden in at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center.[85][59] Present were his sons Beau (whose leg was still in traction from the automobile accident) and Hunter and other family members.[85][59] At 30, he was the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history.[86][87] To see his sons, Biden traveled by train between his Delaware home and D.C.[88]\u201474 minutes each way\u2014and maintained this habit throughout his 36 years in the Senate.[21]\n Elected to the Senate in 1972, Biden was reelected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, regularly receiving about 60% of the vote.[89] He was junior senator to William Roth, who was first elected in 1970, until Roth was defeated in 2000.[90] As of 2022[update], he was the 19th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history.[91]\n During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability.[92] In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns and healthcare but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription.[93] Biden also worked on arms control.[94][95] After Congress failed to ratify the SALT\u00a0II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Biden met with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko to communicate American concerns and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections.[96] He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of South Africa despite its continued policy of apartheid.[39]\n In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[97] In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely.[98] Biden supported a measure[when?] forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them. In 1977, he co-sponsored an amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978.[99]\n Biden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. In 1984, he was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time.[100] In 1994, Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, also known as the Biden Crime Law, which included a ban on assault weapons,[101][102] and the Violence Against Women Act,[103] which he has called his most significant legislation.[104] The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration;[105][106] in 2019, Biden called his role in passing the bill a \"big mistake\", citing its policy on crack cocaine and saying that the bill \"trapped an entire generation\".[107]\n In 1993, Biden voted for a provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gays from serving in the armed forces.[108][109][110] In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring individuals in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same.[111] In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in Obergefell\u00a0v. Hodges.[112]\n Biden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, saying \"it's going to be a cold day in hell\" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers.[113] He voted to acquit during the impeachment of President Clinton.[114] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers.[21] Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act,[21] with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it.[115] As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security.[89][116]\n In February 1988, after several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden was taken by ambulance to Walter Reed Army Medical Center for surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm.[117][118] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, a serious complication.[118] After a second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May,[118][119] Biden's recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months.[120]\n Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997.\n As chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[21] When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval\u200d\u2014\u200cgiven in an interview the previous year\u200d\u2014\u200cof a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered,[121] but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage.[121][122] Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents,[21] Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text.[122] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 9\u20135 vote[122] and then in the full Senate, 58\u201342.[123]\n During Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them,[124] and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to \"beanballs\".[125] After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that Anita Hill, a University of Oklahoma law school professor, had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together.[126][127] Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify.[21] The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment.[128] The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52\u201348 vote, with Biden opposed.[21] Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.[128] In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied.[129]\n Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.[130] His positions were generally liberal internationalist.[94][131] He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party.[130][131] During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy.[132]\n Biden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991,[131] siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators; he said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition.[133]\n Biden became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991.[94] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the \"lift and strike\" policy.[94][130] The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement.[94][131] In April 1993, Biden held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107.[134] Biden said he had told Milo\u0161evi\u0107, \"I think you're a damn war criminal and you should be tried as one.\"[134] Biden wrote an amendment in 1992 to compel the Bush administration to arm the Bosnian Muslims, but deferred in 1994 to a somewhat softer stance the Clinton administration preferred, before signing on the following year to a stronger measure sponsored by Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman.[134] The engagement led to a successful NATO peacekeeping effort.[94] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his \"proudest moment in public life\" related to foreign policy.[131] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia.[94] He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milo\u0161evi\u0107 over Yugoslav actions toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.[131][135]\n Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, \"Whatever it takes, we should do it.\"[136] As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to \"eliminate\" that threat.[137] In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, approving the U.S. Invasion of Iraq.[131] As chair of the committee, he assembled a series of witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his secular government, which was an avowed enemy of al-Qaeda, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction.[138] Biden eventually became a critic of the war and viewed his vote and role as a \"mistake\", but did not push for withdrawal.[131][134] He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should \"level with the American people\" about its cost and length.[130][135]\n By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007,[131][134] saying General David Petraeus was \"dead, flat wrong\" in believing the surge could work.[139] Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states.[140] In November 2006, Biden and Leslie H. Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, released a comprehensive strategy to end sectarian violence in Iraq.[141] Rather than continue the existing approach or withdrawing, the plan called for \"a third way\": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis \"breathing room\" in their own regions.[142] In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate,[141] but the idea failed to gain traction.[139] In May 2008, Biden sharply criticized President George W. Bush's speech to Israel's Knesset in which Bush compared some Democrats to Western leaders who appeased Hitler before World War\u00a0II; Biden called the speech \"bullshit\", \"malarkey\", and \"outrageous\".[143]\n Biden formally declared his candidacy for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination on June 9, 1987.[144] He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability, his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his appeal to Baby Boomers; he would have been the second-youngest person elected president, after John F. Kennedy.[39][145][146] He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate.[145][146]\n By August his campaign's messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries,[147] and in September, he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.[148] Biden's speech had similar lines about being the first person in his family to attend university. Biden had credited Kinnock with the formulation on previous occasions,[149][150] but did not on two occasions in late August.[151]:\u200a230\u2013232\u200a[150] Kinnock himself was more forgiving; the two men met in 1988, forming an enduring friendship.[152]\n Earlier that year he had also used passages from a 1967 speech by Robert F. Kennedy (for which his aides took blame) and a short phrase from John F. Kennedy's inaugural address; two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by Hubert Humphrey.[153] Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit, and that one of his rivals for the nomination, Jesse Jackson, had called him to point out that he (Jackson) had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used.[21][28]\n A few days later, an incident in law school in which Biden drew text from a Fordham Law Review article with inadequate citations was publicized.[28] He was required to repeat the course and passed with high marks.[154] At Biden's request the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules.[155]\n Biden has made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college, that he attended law school on a full scholarship, that he had graduated in the top half of his class,[156][157] and that he had marched in the civil rights movement.[158] The limited amount of other news about the presidential race amplified these disclosures[159] and on September 23, 1987, Biden withdrew his candidacy, saying it had been overrun by \"the exaggerated shadow\" of his past mistakes.[160]\n After exploring the possibility of a run in several previous cycles, in January 2007, Biden declared his candidacy in the 2008 elections.[89][161][162] During his campaign, Biden focused on the Iraq War, his record as chairman of major Senate committees, and his foreign-policy experience. In mid-2007, Biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to Obama's.[163] Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani: \"There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11.\"[164]\n Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton.[165] He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates. In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.[166] He withdrew from the race that evening.[167]\n Despite its lack of success, Biden's 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world.[168]:\u200a336\u200a In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close: Biden resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom,[139][169] while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.[168]:\u200a28,\u200a337\u2013338\u200a Having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaign style and appeal to working-class voters, and Biden said he became convinced Obama was \"the real deal\".[169][168]:\u200a28,\u200a337\u2013338\u200a\n Shortly after Biden withdrew from the presidential race, Obama privately told him he was interested in finding an important place for Biden in his administration.[170] In early August, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility,[170] and developed a strong personal rapport.[169] On August 22, 2008, Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate.[171] The New York Times reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone with foreign policy and national security experience.[172] Others pointed out Biden's appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters.[173][174] Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 by voice vote at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.[175]\n Biden's vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention, as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[176][177] Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks, such as one he made about Obama's being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office, which had attracted negative attention.[178][179] Privately, Biden's remarks frustrated Obama. \"How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?\" he asked.[168]:\u200a411\u2013414,\u200a419\u200a Obama campaign staffers called Biden's blunders \"Joe bombs\" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which in turn irked Biden.[180] Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized on a call to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership.[168]:\u200a411\u2013414\u200a Publicly, Obama strategist David Axelrod said Biden's high popularity ratings had outweighed any unexpected comments.[181]\n As the financial crisis of 2007\u20132010 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008 and the proposed bailout of the United States financial system became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted for the $700\u00a0billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed in the Senate, 74\u201325.[182] On October 2, 2008, he participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis. Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had won the debate overall.[183] Nationally, Biden had a 60% favorability rating in a Pew Research Center poll, compared to Palin's 44%.[178]\n On November 4, 2008, Obama and Biden were elected with 53% of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes to McCain\u2013Palin's 173.[184][185][186]\n At the same time Biden was running for vice president, he was also running for reelection to the Senate,[187] as permitted by Delaware law.[89] On November\u00a04, he was reelected to the Senate, defeating Republican Christine O'Donnell.[188] Having won both races, Biden made a point of waiting to resign from the Senate until he was sworn in for his seventh term on January 6, 2009.[189] Biden cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350\u00a0billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program,[190] and resigned from the Senate later that day.[n 2]\n Biden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by George W. Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency.[194] He chaired Obama's transition team[195] and headed an initiative to improve middle-class economic well-being.[196] In early January 2009, in his last act as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he visited the leaders of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan,[197] and on January 20 he was sworn in as the 47th vice president of the United States[198]\u200d\u2014\u200cthe first vice president from Delaware[199] and the first Roman Catholic vice president.[200][201]\n Obama was soon comparing Biden to a basketball player \"who does a bunch of things that don't show up in the stat sheet\".[202] In May, Biden visited Kosovo and affirmed the U.S. position that its \"independence is irreversible\".[203] Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about sending 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan,[204][205] but his skepticism was valued,[206] and in 2009, Biden's views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.[207] Biden visited Iraq about every two months,[139] becoming the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there.[206] More generally, overseeing Iraq policy became Biden's responsibility: Obama was said to have said, \"Joe, you do Iraq.\"[208] By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011.[209][210]\n Biden oversaw infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession.[211] During this period, Biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred,[206] and when he completed that role in February 2011, he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent.[212]\n In late April 2009, Biden's off-message response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak led to a swift retraction by the White House.[213] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes.[214][207][215] Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had \"misread how bad the economy was\" but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up.[216] On March 23, 2010, a microphone picked up Biden telling the president that his signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was \"a big fucking deal\" during live national news telecasts. Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.[180]\n Members of the Obama administration said Biden's role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions.[217] Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff, said that Biden helped counter groupthink.[202] Obama said, \"The best thing about Joe is that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me.\"[206] The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.[218]\n Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party.[219] Following big Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important.[220][221] He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty.[220][221] In December 2010, Biden's advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that included a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts.[221][222] The package passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010.\n In March 2011, Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress to resolve federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown.[223] The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next few months, but Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved key in breaking a deadlock and bringing about a deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011, signed on August 2, 2011, the same day an unprecedented U.S. default had loomed.[224][225][226] Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden,[209][227] lest failure adversely affect Obama's reelection prospects.[228][229]\n In October 2010, Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election,[219] but with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden on the ticket with Hillary Clinton.[230] The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama,[230] and White House officials later said Obama himself had never entertained the idea.[231]\n Biden's May 2012 statement that he was \"absolutely comfortable\" with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obama's position, which had been described as \"evolving\".[232] Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were quite irked, since Obama had planned to shift position several months later, in the build-up to the party convention.[180][233][234] Gay rights advocates seized upon Biden's statement,[233] and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's remarks.[235] Biden apologized to Obama in private for having spoken out,[236][237] while Obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart.[233]\n The Obama campaign valued Biden as a retail-level politician, and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the reelection campaign began in earnest in spring 2012.[238][209] An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that Republican proposals to relax Wall Street regulations would \"put y'all back in chains\" once again drew attention to Biden's propensity for colorful remarks.[238][239][240] In the vice-presidential debate on October 11 with Republican nominee Paul Ryan, Biden defended the Obama administration's record.[241][242] On November 6, Obama and Biden won reelection[243] over Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan with 332 of 538 Electoral College votes and 51% of the popular vote.[244]\n In December 2012, Obama named Biden to head the Gun Violence Task Force, created to address the causes of school shootings and consider possible gun control to implement in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[245] Later that month, during the final days before the United States fell off the \"fiscal cliff\", Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 being passed at the start of 2013.[246][247] It made many of the Bush tax cuts permanent but raised rates on upper income levels.[247]\n Biden was inaugurated to a second term on January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony at Number One Observatory Circle, his official residence, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21).[248]\n Biden played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved the federal government shutdown of 2013 and the debt-ceiling crisis of 2013. This was because Senate majority leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cut him out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.[249][250][251]\n Biden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized again in 2013. The act led to related developments, such as the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden and Valerie Jarrett as co-chairs.[252][253]\n Biden favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[254] As Iraq fell apart during 2014, renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006, with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along.[255][256] Biden himself said the U.S. would follow ISIL \"to the gates of hell\".[257] Biden had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and was assigned a focus on the region during the administration; he visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency, the most of any president or vice president.[258] In August 2016, Biden visited Serbia, where he met with Serbian president Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 and expressed his condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War.[259]\n Biden never cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate, making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction.[260]\n During his second term, Biden was often said to be preparing for a possible bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.[261] With his family, many friends, and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race, and with Hillary Clinton's favorability ratings in decline at that time, Biden was reported to again be seriously considering the prospect and a \"Draft Biden 2016\" PAC was established.[261][262][263] By late 2015, Biden was still uncertain about running. He felt his son's recent death had largely drained his emotional energy, and said, \"nobody has a right\u00a0... to seek that office unless they're willing to give it 110% of who they are.\"[264] On October 21, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not to run for president in 2016.[265][266][267] In January 2016, Biden affirmed that it was the right decision, but said he regretted not running for president \"every day\".[268]\n After leaving the vice presidency, Biden became an honorary professor at the University of Pennsylvania, developing the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.[269] He also continued to lead efforts to find treatments for cancer.[270] In 2017, he wrote a memoir, Promise Me, Dad, and went on a book tour.[271] Biden earned $15.6\u00a0million from 2017 to 2018.[272] In 2018, he gave a eulogy for Senator John McCain, praising McCain's embrace of American ideals and bipartisan friendships.[273] Biden was targeted by two pipe bombs that were mailed to him during the October 2018 mail bombing attempts.[274][275]\n Biden remained in the public eye, endorsing candidates while continuing to comment on politics, climate change, and the presidency of Donald Trump.[276][277][278] He also continued to speak out in favor of LGBT rights, continuing advocacy on an issue he had become more closely associated with during his vice presidency.[279][280] By 2019, Biden and his wife reported that their assets had increased to[clarification needed] between $2.2\u00a0million and $8\u00a0million from speaking engagements and a contract to write a set of books.[281]\n Between 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020.[282] When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying \"never say never\".[283] A political action committee known as Time for Biden was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden's entry into the race.[284] He finally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019,[285] saying he was prompted to run, among other reasons, by his \"sense of duty.\"[286]\n In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter Biden.[287] Despite the allegations, no evidence was produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.[288][289][290] The media widely interpreted this pressure to investigate the Bidens as trying to hurt Biden's chances of winning the presidency, resulting in a political scandal[291][292] and Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives. \n \nIn March 2019 and April 2019, eight women accused Biden of previous instances of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing.[293] Biden had previously called himself a \"tactile politician\" and admitted this behavior has caused trouble for him.[294] In April 2019, Biden pledged to be more \"respectful of people's personal space\".[295] Throughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls.[296][297] Despite this, he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses, and eight days later, fifth in the New Hampshire primary.[298][299] He performed better in the Nevada caucuses, reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still finished 21.6 percentage points behind Bernie Sanders.[300] Making strong appeals to Black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the South Carolina primary by more than 28 points.[301] After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, he made large gains in the March\u00a03 Super Tuesday primary elections. Biden won 18 of the next 26 contests, putting him in the lead overall.[302] Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states on March 10.[303]\n In late March 2020, Tara Reade, one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, accused Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993.[304] There were inconsistencies between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations.[304][305] Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation.[306][307]\n When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for president.[308] On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden in a live-streamed discussion from their homes.[309] Former President Barack Obama endorsed Biden the next day.[310] On August 11, he announced U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.[311] On August 18, 2020, Biden was officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election.[312][313][314]\n Biden was elected the 46th president of the United States in November 2020. He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H.\u00a0W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been \"stolen\" from him through \"voter fraud\", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[315] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[316] On November\u00a023, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[317]\n On January 6, 2021, during Congress' electoral vote count, Trump told supporters gathered in front of the White House to march to the Capitol, saying, \"We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.\"[318] Soon after, they attacked the Capitol. During the insurrection at the Capitol, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events \"an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times.\"[319][320] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[321]\n Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021.[322] At 78, he is the oldest person to have assumed the office.[322] He is the second Catholic president (after John F. Kennedy)[323] and the first president whose home state is Delaware.[324] He is also the first man since George H. W. Bush to have been both vice president and president, and the second non-incumbent vice president (after Richard Nixon in 1968) to be elected president.[325] He is also the first president from the Silent Generation.[326]\n Biden's inauguration was \"a muted affair unlike any previous inauguration\" due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures because of the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Trump did not attend, becoming the first outgoing president since 1869 to not attend his successor's inauguration.[327]\n In his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders. By his third day, orders had included rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico, directing the government to rejoin the World Health Organization, face mask requirements on federal property, measures to combat hunger in the United States,[328][329][330][331] and revoking permits for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.[332][333][334] In his first two weeks in office, Biden signed more executive orders than any other president since Franklin D. Roosevelt had in their first month in office.[335]\n On February 4, 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States was ending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen.[336]\n On March 11, the first anniversary of COVID-19 being declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9\u00a0trillion economic stimulus relief package he proposed and lobbied for that aimed to speed up the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing recession.[337] The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit. Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, but after the Senate parliamentarian determined that including the increase in a budget reconciliation bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats declined to pursue overruling her and removed the increase from the package.[338][339][340]\n Also in March, amid a rise in migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico, Biden told migrants, \"Don't come over.\" In the meantime, migrant adults \"are being sent back\", Biden said, in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations.[341] Biden earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them (before they were sent to sponsors), leading the Biden administration in March to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help.[342]\n On April 14, Biden announced that the United States would delay the withdrawal of all troops from the war in Afghanistan until September 11, signaling an end to the country's direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years.[343] In February 2020, the Trump administration had made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021.[344] Biden's decision met with a wide range of reactions, from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support.[345] On April 22\u201323, Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%\u201352% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Other countries also increased their pledges.[346][347] On April 28, the eve of his 100th day in office, Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress.[348]\n In May 2021, during a flareup in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, Biden expressed his support for Israel, saying \"my party still supports Israel\".[349] In June 2021, Biden took his first trip abroad as president. In eight days he visited Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. He attended a G7 summit, a NATO summit, and an EU summit, and held one-on-one talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin.[350]\n On June 17, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which officially declared Juneteenth a federal holiday.[351] Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday since 1986.[352] In July 2021, amid a slowing of the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, Biden said that the country has \"a pandemic for those who haven't gotten the vaccination\" and that it was therefore \"gigantically important\" for Americans to be vaccinated.[353] In September 2021, Biden announced AUKUS, a security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ensure \"peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term\"; the deal included nuclear-powered submarines built for Australia's use.[354]\n By the end of 2021, 40 of Biden's appointed judges to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in their first year in office since Ronald Reagan.[355][356] Biden has prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with the majority of appointments being women and people of color.[357] Most of his appointments have been in blue states, making a limited impact since the courts in these states already traditionally lean liberal.[358]\n In the first eight months of his presidency, Biden's approval rating, according to Morning Consult polling, remained above 50%. In August, it began to decline and lowered into the low forties by December.[359] The decline in his approval is attributed to the Afghanistan withdrawal, increasing hospitalizations from the Delta variant, high inflation and gas prices, disarray within the Democratic Party, and a general decline in popularity customary in politics.[360][361][362][363]\n Biden entered office nine months into a recovery from the COVID-19 recession and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages and stock market returns, amid significantly elevated inflation. Real GDP grew 5.7%, the fastest rate in 37 years.[364] Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year.[365][366] By the end of 2021, inflation reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1%, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years.[367][368][369][370]\n American forces began withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2020, under the provisions of a February 2020 US-Taliban agreement that set a May 1, 2021, deadline.[371] The Taliban began an offensive on May 1.[372][373] By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn.[344] Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, \"The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\"[344]\n On August 15, the Afghan government collapsed under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.[344][374] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist in the evacuation of American personnel and Afghan allies.[375] He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal,[376] with the evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies described as chaotic and botched.[377][378][379] On August 16, Biden addressed the \"messy\" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation \"unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated\".[374][380] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves\".[380][381]\n On August 26, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. On August 27, an American drone strike killed two ISIS-K targets, who were \"planners and facilitators\", according to a U.S. Army general.[382] On August 29, another American drone strike killed 10 civilians, including seven children; the Defense Department initially claimed the strike was conducted on an Islamic State suicide bomber threatening Kabul Airport, but admitted the mistake on September 17 and apologized.[383]\n The U.S. military completed withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30, with Biden saying that the evacuation effort was an \"extraordinary success\", by extracting over 120,000 Americans, Afghans and other allies.[384] He acknowledged that between \"100 to 200\" Americans who wanted to leave were left in Afghanistan, despite his August 18 pledge to stay in Afghanistan until all Americans who wanted to leave had left.[385]\n As part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the American Jobs Plan, a $2\u00a0trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development.[386][387] After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1\u00a0trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,[388][389] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband.[390] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021.[391]\n The other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5\u00a0trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change.[392][393] The bill did not have Republican support, so Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin, even as the price was lowered to $2.2\u00a0trillion.[394] After Manchin rejected the bill,[395] the Build Back Better Act's size was reduced and comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform.[396]\n Before and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort.[397] He tried to convince China[398] and Australia[399] to do more. He convened an online Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change to press other countries to strengthen their climate policy.[400][401] Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024.[402] Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40% of global emissions.[403]\n In early 2022, Biden made efforts to change his public image after entering the year with low approval ratings due to inflation and high gas prices, which continued to fall to approximately 40% in aggregated polls by February.[404][405][406] He began the year by endorsing a change to the Senate filibuster to allow for the passing of the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act, on both of which the Senate had failed to invoke cloture.[407] The rules change failed when two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.[408]\n In January, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, a moderate liberal nominated by Bill Clinton, announced his intention to retire from the Supreme Court. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred,[409] a promise he reiterated after the announcement of Breyer's retirement.[410] On February 25, Biden nominated federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.[411] She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 7[412] and sworn in on June 30.[413]\n In early February, Biden ordered the counterterrorism raid in northern Syria that resulted in the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the second leader of the Islamic State.[414] In late July, Biden approved the drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second leader of Al-Qaeda, and an integral member in the planning of the September 11 attacks.[415]\n Also in February, after warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden led the U.S. response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, imposing severe sanctions on Russia and authorizing over $8 billion in weapons shipments to Ukraine.[416][417][418] On April 29, Biden asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine,[419] but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion.[420] Biden blamed Vladimir Putin for the emerging energy and food crises,[421] saying, \"Putin's war has raised the price of food because Ukraine and Russia are two of the world's major bread baskets for wheat and corn, the basic product for so many foods around the world.\"[422]\n China's assertiveness, particularly in the Pacific, remained a challenge for Biden. The Solomon Islands-China security pact caused alarm, as China could build military bases across the South Pacific. Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal, as Anthony Albanese succeeded to the premiership of Australia and Jacinda Ardern's government took a firmer line on Chinese influence.[423][424][425] On September 18, 2022, Reuters reported that \"Joe Biden said U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, his most explicit statement on the issue, drawing an angry response from China that said it sent the wrong signal to those seeking an independent Taiwan.\" The policy was stated in contrast to Biden's previous exclusion of boots-on-the-ground and planes-in-the-air for U.S. support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.[426]\n The 2022 OPEC+ oil production cut caused a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia, widening the rift between the two countries, and threatening a longstanding alliance.[427][428]\n On July 21, 2022, Biden tested positive for COVID-19 with reportedly mild symptoms.[429] According to the White House, he was treated with Paxlovid.[430] He worked in isolation in the White House for five days[431] and returned to isolation when he tested positive again on July 30.[432]\n In April 2022, Biden signed into law the bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 to revamp the finances and operations of the United States Postal Service agency.[433]\n On July 28, 2022, the Biden administration announced it would fill four wide gaps on the Mexico\u2013United States border in Arizona near Yuma, an area with some of the busiest corridors for illegal crossings. During his presidential campaign, Biden had pledged to cease all future border wall construction.[434] This occurred after both allies and critics of Biden criticized his administration's management of the southern border.[435]\n In the summer of 2022, several other pieces of legislation Biden supported passed Congress. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act aimed to address gun reform issues following the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas.[436] The gun control laws in the bill include extended background checks for gun purchasers under 21, clarification of Federal Firearms License requirements, funding for state red flag laws and other crisis intervention programs, further criminalization of arms trafficking and straw purchases, and partial closure of the boyfriend loophole.[437][438][439] Biden signed the bill on June 25, 2022.[440]\n The Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 was introduced in 2021, and signed into law by Biden on August 10, 2022.[441] The act intends to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances during military service, including burn pits.[442] The bill gained significant media coverage due to the activism of comedian Jon Stewart.[443]\n Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022.[444] The act provides billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductors in the United States, to compete economically with China.[445]\n The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by Senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin, resulting from continuing negotiations on Biden's initial Build Back Better agenda, which Manchin had blocked the previous year.[446][447] The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change, $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform.[448] According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower US greenhouse gas emissions between 31% and 44% below 2005 levels by 2030.[449] On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51\u201350 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. The bill was passed by the House on August 12[449] and was signed by Biden on August 16.[450][451]\n On October 6, 2022, Biden pardoned all Americans convicted of small amounts of marijuana possession under federal law.[452]\n On December 13, 2022, Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and requires the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial marriages in the United States.[453]\n On September 2, 2022, in a nationally broadcast Philadelphia speech, Biden called for a \"battle for the soul of the nation\". Off camera, he called active Trump supporters \"semi-fascists\", which Republican commentators denounced.[454][455][456] A predicted Republican wave election did not materialize and the race for U.S. Congress control was much closer than expected, with Republicans securing a slim majority of 222 seats in the House of Representatives,[457][458][459][460] and Democrats keeping control of the U.S. Senate, with 51 seats, a gain of one seat from the last Congress.[461][n 3]\n It was the first midterm election since 1986 in which the party of the incumbent president achieved a net gain in governorships, and the first since 1934 in which the president's party lost no state legislative chambers.[463] Democrats credited Biden for their unexpectedly favorable performance,[464] and he celebrated the results as a strong day for democracy.[465]\n Biden is considered a moderate Democrat[466] and a centrist.[467][468] Throughout his long career, his positions have been aligned with the center of the Democratic Party.[469] In 2022, journalist Sasha Issenberg wrote that Biden's \"most valuable political skill\" was \"an innate compass for the ever-shifting mainstream of the Democratic party.\"[470]\n Biden has proposed partially reversing the corporate tax cuts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying that doing so would not hurt businesses' ability to hire.[471][472] He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)[473] and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[474] Biden is a staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[475][476] He has promoted a plan to expand and build upon it, paid for by revenue gained from reversing some Trump administration tax cuts.[475] Biden's plan aims to expand health insurance coverage to 97% of Americans, including by creating a public health insurance option.[477]\n Biden has supported same-sex marriage since 2012[478][479] and also supports Roe v. Wade and repealing the Hyde Amendment.[480][481] He opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[482] As a senator, he forged deep relationships with police groups and was a chief proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure that police unions supported but police chiefs opposed.[483][484] In 2020, Biden also ran on decriminalizing cannabis,[485] after zealously advocating the War on Drugs as a U.S. senator.[486][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n Biden believes action must be taken on global warming. As a senator, he co-sponsored the Boxer\u2013Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate.[487] He wants to achieve a carbon-free power sector in the U.S. by 2035 and stop emissions completely by 2050.[488] His program includes reentering the Paris Agreement, nature conservation, and green building.[489]\n Biden has said the U.S. needs to \"get tough\" on China, calling China the \"most serious competitor\" that poses challenges to the United States' \"prosperity, security, and democratic values\".[490][491] Biden has spoken about human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region to the Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, pledging to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.[492][493]\n Biden has said he is against regime change, but for providing non-military support to opposition movements.[494] He opposed direct U.S. intervention in Libya,[495][217] voted against U.S. participation in the Gulf War,[496] voted in favor of the Iraq War,[497] and supports a two-state solution in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.[498] Biden has pledged to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and to reevaluate the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia.[277] Biden supports extending the New START arms control treaty with Russia to limit the number of nuclear weapons deployed by both sides.[499][500] In 2021, Biden recognized the Armenian genocide, becoming the first U.S. president to do so.[501]\n Biden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate,[502][503][504] which he attributed to his having been elected young.[505] Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed campaign finance reform measures during his first term.[100] As of November\u00a02009[update], Biden's net worth was $27,012.[506] By November 2020[update], the Bidens were worth $9\u00a0million, largely due to sales of Biden's books and speaking fees after his vice presidency.[507][508][509][510]\n The political writer Howard Fineman has written, \"Biden is not an academic, he's not a theoretical thinker, he's a great street pol. He comes from a long line of working people in Scranton\u2014auto salesmen, car dealers, people who know how to make a sale. He has that great Irish gift.\"[43] Political columnist David S. Broder wrote that Biden has grown over time: \"He responds to real people\u2014that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better.\"[43] Journalist James Traub has written that \"Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself.\"[139]\n In recent years, especially after the 2015 death of his elder son Beau, Biden has been noted for his empathetic nature and ability to communicate about grief.[511][512] In 2020, CNN wrote that his presidential campaign aimed to make him \"healer-in-chief\", while The New York Times described his extensive history of being called upon to give eulogies.[513]\n Journalist and TV anchor Wolf Blitzer has described Biden as loquacious.[514] He often deviates from prepared remarks[515] and sometimes \"puts his foot in his mouth.\"[516][176][517][518] The New York Times wrote that Biden's \"weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything.\"[176] In 2018, Biden called himself \"a gaffe machine\".[519] Some of his gaffes have been characterized as racially insensitive.[520][521][522][523]\n According to The New York Times, Biden often embellishes elements of his life or exaggerates, a trait also noted by The New Yorker in 2014.[524][525] For instance, Biden has claimed to have been more active in the civil rights movement than he actually was, and has falsely recalled being an excellent student who earned three college degrees.[524] The Times wrote, \"Mr. Biden's folksiness can veer into folklore, with dates that don't quite add up and details that are exaggerated or wrong, the factual edges shaved off to make them more powerful for audiences.\"[525]\n"], "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-incorporated-nyse-sna-looks-120439084.html": [" Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Snap-on investors that purchase the stock on or after the 18th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 9th of December. The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.62 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$6.48 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Snap-on has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current stock price of $234.31. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Snap-on's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Snap-on has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.  View our latest analysis for Snap-on  Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Snap-on paid out a comfortable 34% of its profit last year. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 50% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies. It's positive to see that Snap-on's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut. Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see Snap-on's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later. Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Snap-on has lifted its dividend by approximately 17% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it. Has Snap-on got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We love that Snap-on is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research. So while Snap-on looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Snap-on and you should be aware of it before buying any shares. Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

One prominent name to wade in on the matter is billionaire David Rubenstein. The Carlyle Group co-founder believes that due to the current economic environment of \"jacked up\" interest rates, gross domestic product growth is set to decelerate, bringing in to play a recession.

Congress is on the verge of passing a bill that aims to help Americans save more for retirement, including raising the age people must start withdrawing money from tax-deferred retirement accounts. Corporate earnings are set to take a hit and Wall Street isn't properly anticipating it, Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson warns. And when earnings fall, so will stocks. The big market headline this year \u2013 all year \u2013 has been the steady fall in stocks. The S&P 500 is down 20% for 2022, and the NASDAQ has fallen a disastrous 33%. And while recent data shows that there may be some hope on the inflation front, there may still be storm clouds massing for next year\u2019s stock market. That\u2019s the view of Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief equity strategist. He\u2019s been a leading voice among the bears this year, and he\u2019s not changing that tune as we head into the New Year. After falling 50%, the stock is still much too expensive even if you are optimistic about the company's future growth.

Of course, a dividend increase is great because it puts more income into the pockets of investors and increases the yield on their purchase price, but more importantly, a dividend increase also signals to the markets that the company expects to perform well, perhaps generating increases in revenue and funds from Against a backdrop of soaring inflation, a slowing economy and persistent rate hikes, assessing the playbook for the coming year, CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer says it\u2019s more important than ever to look at the past year and see what worked.

(formerly BYOB) is a visual, drag-and-drop programming language. It is an extended reimplementation of Scratch (a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab) that allows you to Build Your Own Blocks. It also features first class[1] lists, first class procedures, and first class continuations[2]. These added capabilities make it suitable for a serious introduction to computer science for high school or college students. In the example below, a Snap! user can create new control structures, such as a for loop, by writing a script as shown at the left. Once the for block is created, it can be used even to make nested loops, as shown in the center. A sprite carries out that script at the right.  Snap! runs in your browser. It is implemented using Javascript, which is designed to limit the ability of browser-based software to affect your computer outside of Snap! itself, so it\u2019s safe to run even other people\u2019s projects, even if you don\u2019t trust our competence or good intentions.  (Our lawyers make us say we offer NO WARRANTY; see our Terms of Service.) Snap! is presented by the University of California at Berkeley. It is developed by Jens M\u00f6nig at SAP, with design input and documentation by Brian Harvey at UC Berkeley, and contributions by students at UC Berkeley and elsewhere. A data type is considered first class in a programming language if instances of that type can be For example, numbers are first class in every language. Text strings are first class in many languages, but not in C, in which the relevant first class type is \u201cpointer to a character.\u201d One of the limitations of Scratch as a language for computer science education is that its lists are not first class, so you can\u2019t have a list of lists. Making lists first class is enough of an extension to Scratch to allow the creation of any other data structures (trees, heaps, hash tables, dictionaries, and so on) in user-defined Snap! code,\nimplemented as lists of lists. A less obvious limitation, because it is shared by many \u201cadult\u201d programming languages, is that procedures (blocks) are not first class. Making blocks first class in Snap! allows us to create control structures, such as the for block above, as user-defined Snap! code.  In particular, users can write the higher order list functions that are essential in the functional programming style. Without\u00a0being doctrinaire about it, we believe that in general, anything that\u2019s in a language at all should be first class in that language. The Snap! object system introduces first class sprites, first class costumes, and first class sounds. One example of a data type that exists behind the scenes in pretty much every programming language is the stack frame, the data structure that keeps track of active procedure calls and their local variables. Following Scheme, we make these data available to the programmer in the form of a first class data type called a continuation, which represents \u201cthe work still to be done after this point\u201d as a callable procedure. Using continuations, the Snap! programmer can implement nonlocal control mechanisms such as catch/throw and threads. Part of the genius of Scratch is the way it uses pictures to represent ideas such as loops, Booleans, and threads. The three different block shapes, for example, aren\u2019t just a way to prevent syntax errors; they\u2019re a way to teach the idea that some procedures return values and others don\u2019t. In Snap! we extend this visual teaching to ideas that have previously been considered too hard for young learners. For example, the banner on our home page includes this picture of a list of blocks. Experienced Scratch programmers will never have seen anything quite like this before, but they recognize the pictorial representation of a list in Scratch, and they know what blocks look like, and so it\u2019s immediately obvious to them what they\u2019re seeing. They realize without explicit teaching that blocks, which they\u2019ve until then used only as program control elements, can also be used as data. About About Snap!

During the founding of the federal government, African Americans were consigned to a status of second-class citizenship or enslaved.[3] No African American served in federal elective office before the ratification in 1870 of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Fifteenth Amendment prohibits the federal and state governments from denying any citizen the right to vote because of that citizen's race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\n Joseph Rainey was the first African-American representative to be seated in the U.S. House. He served South Carolina's 1st congressional district beginning in 1870 during the Reconstruction era following the American Civil War. The first African-American woman to serve as a representative was Shirley Chisholm from New York's 12th congressional district in 1969 during the Civil Rights Movement.\n Many African-American members of the House of Representatives serve majority-minority districts.[4] Some of these congressional districts are gerrymandered, limiting serious challenges to their re-election, and limiting their abilities to represent a larger, more diverse constituency.[4]  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 includes restrictions on the ability of States to diminish minority representation during redistricting.  In the elections of 2016 and 2018, an increasing number of non-majority-minority districts have elected racial minority representatives.\n Overall, 30 of the 50 U.S. states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia, have elected an African American to represent them in the U.S. House of Representatives, with Washington being the most recent to elect their first (in 2020); out of these, 21 states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia, have elected an African-American woman to represent them in the U.S. House. Illinois's 1st congressional district has the longest continuous streak of electing African-American representatives, a tendency that has occurred from 1928 to the present.

Become a better photographer. 4.8 Million Annual Readers 51,000+ Newsletter Subscribers 1,190+ Featured Photographers 1,200+ Photography Guides & Gear Reviews  Learn about the benefits of aspherical lenses (Asph Lens) in photography and why you should (or shouldn't) attach one to your camera in 2022.  By Usnea Lebendig Ever wonder what the difference is between an aspherical lens and a \u201cnormal\u201d spherical lens? Maybe you\u2019re looking at buying a new lens and aren\u2019t sure if you should fork out the extra cash for the one marked \u201cAsph Lens,\u201d or you\u2019re just wondering what makes aspheric lenses expensive. Either way, knowing what an aspherical lens is and what it does will help you in better understanding your gear and when it comes time to purchase new types of camera lenses, you\u2019ll have a better idea of what to buy. So let\u2019s take a look at the aspherical lens, what it does, and why it just might be worth that extra hit to your wallet. Table of Contents An aspherical lens is simply a lens that doesn\u2019t have a spherical surface shape. Instead, it has an aspheric surface (i.e. non-spherical), usually with counter-curves near its edges. These counter-curves direct light rays hitting the edges of a lens to converge at the same point of focus as the light rays hitting the center. Standard lenses use spherical elements, many of which aren\u2019t natively able to direct the light reaching its edges to the same focal point as the light reaching its center. Designers \u2013 especially with wide-angle lenses \u2013 often have to stop-down their optical systems to exclude the corners so as to avoid an excess of field curvature. The lens surface of an aspherical lens corrects for this, making it possible to shoot at wider apertures and allowing us to use the entire surface of the lens. Aspherical lenses are used primarily in high-end optics to create sharper images and reduce or eliminate certain optical imperfections (i.e. chromatic aberrations, field curvature, etc.). They also allow manufacturers to create smaller and lighter lenses since they reduce the need for numerous lens elements and lens groups. As you can imagine, aspherical lenses aren\u2019t just used in cameras. They\u2019re a vital part of any system that needs a high standard of optical quality, from telescopes and contact lenses, to rifle sights and missile-guidance systems. Aspheric eyeglass lenses are especially useful in combatting astigmatism. 1. Physically, spherical lenses have a front surface that is spherical, meaning the curve is the same from top to bottom and left to right \u2013 like a portion of a sphere. Aspheric lenses, on the other hand, have curves that deviate from the regular spherical curve. 2. Aspherical lenses are much more challenging to manufacture. The result is a much deeper hit to your wallet! The aspherical glass lenses used in top-of-the-line telephoto and wide-angle lenses are particularly expensive. They\u2019re usually ground and polished by hand. Less expensive aspheric lenses \u2013 like those used in point-and-shoots \u2013 will often be made of plastic or resin. 3. An aspherical lens element has much more precise control of how light travels inside your lens. So much so, that one asphere can oftentimes negate the need for many of the standard lens elements that would otherwise be needed to achieve the same effect. The result?\u00a0 A much lighter, more compact lens. Ideally, light rays, when passing through a camera lens element, would all converge at a single point thereby creating a sharp focus. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the case with many spherical lenses. Spherical aberrations occur when incoming light rays pass through a spherical lens and focus at different points, causing blurry images and reducing overall image quality. One way to compensate for this is by using a combination of concave and convex lens elements. Another way is by using an aspheric lens. Aspherical lenses are curved outwards on their rear element so that they can better direct light rays into a single focal point.\u00a0These counter-curves help correct spherical aberration, creating sharper images. Are aspherical camera lenses better than normal camera lenses? Absolutely! They\u2019ll make your lens lighter, your images sharper, and bring aberrations and distortion down to near zero. The only downside is how much they cost. In the past, only pros could afford such top-of-the-line optics. These days they\u2019re still spendy, but at least they\u2019re not completely the ballpark for ordinary photographers. It\u2019s really amazing how far modern optics have come. Not too long ago, only pros could afford full-frame cameras and aspherical lenses. Now those of us in the prosumer world can get them too. Of course, asph lenses are considerably more expensive than spherical lenses, but high-quality glass will last a lifetime, so if you can spring for the high-performing lens, go for it!

Teri Finneman is an associate professor in the School of Journalism and Mass Communications at the University of Kansas. She is the author of Press Portrayals of Women Politicians, 1870s-2000s.\n This episode is sponsored by Taylor & Francis, publisher of Journalism History.

(Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 2.0) Nick Hirshon (00:11): Welcome to Journalism History, a podcast that rips out the pages of your history books to re-examine the stories you thought you knew, and the ones you were never told. Teri Finneman (00:21): I\u2019m Teri Finneman, and I research media coverage of women in politics. Nick Hirshon (00:27): I\u2019m Nick Hirshon, and I research the history of New York sports. Ken Ward (00:31): And I\u2019m Ken Ward, and I research the journalism history of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains. Nick Hirshon (00:36): And together we are professional media historians guiding you through our own drafts of history. This episode is sponsored by Taylor and Francis, the publisher of our academic journal, Journalism History. Transcripts of the show are available online at journalism-history.org/podcast. Today, we have a special episode of the Journalism History podcast. We\u2019ve just learned that Joe Biden has been elected the 46th president of the United States, and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, will become the first woman to serve as vice president. And so for the first time we are recording and releasing an episode of the Journalism History podcast on the same day as history is unfolding. I\u2019m excited to talk today with a voice that will sound familiar to our listeners, the executive producer of the Journalism History podcast and one of our hosts, Dr. Teri Finneman of the University of Kansas. Teri\u2019s research focuses on news coverage of U.S. first ladies and women politicians, as well as the U.S. suffrage movement. And she is the author of Press Portrayals of Women Politicians, 1870s-2000s, published in 2015 by Lexington Books. So Teri, Biden has just captured the battleground state of Pennsylvania and the TV networks have announced that puts him over the top for the 270 electoral votes he needed to ascend to the White House. Kamala Harris becomes the vice president. She is 56 years old, the daughter Indian and Jamaican immigrants. A moment in history. So as someone who has studied women in politics, what does this moment mean to you? Teri Finneman (02:11): It\u2019s really overwhelming quite honestly, and I don\u2019t know if the emotional impact of it has, has really sunk in yet for me and for other women across the country. One of the things that I think it\u2019s important to point out from the get-go is that my research is non-partisan. I study sexism that Republican women and Democratic women have faced in their journey to rise in American politics. So I want that to be clear, that I\u2019m speaking from not a partisan view today, but from a women\u2019s history perspective today, and what this means to finally have reached this. We haven\u2019t hit the presidency yet, right? But I think a lot of the emotion that you\u2019re going to see pour out from this is going to be tied to the extreme disappointment that so many people had in 2016, when it was expected that Hillary Clinton was going to break that barrier. I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of that emotion pour out with this election. Obviously the vice presidency isn\u2019t the presidency, but this is just such a monumental moment in American history, which is why we\u2019re doing this show. Nick Hirshon (03:19): And certainly I want to get emotion with you a little bit later on, talking about what this moment may mean to you personally. I\u2019d like to just point out I grew up in New York City, in a neighborhood in the borough of Queens named Forest Hills, and that\u2019s where I\u2019m recording the podcast today. And one of the favorite daughters of Forest Hills is Geraldine Ferraro, who was the first female vice presidential nominee representing a major American political party. She served in the House of Representatives from 1979 to 1985, and she was the Democratic Party\u2019s vice presidential nominee in 1984, running alongside Walter Mondale. I know, Teri, you\u2019ve studied many women in politics long before Geraldine Ferraro and some after, too. So could you provide us with some of that historical context \u2013 who are some of the women pioneers who have gone through this political movement who have led up to this historic moment? Teri Finneman (04:07): Well, we\u2019re going to talk about the suffrage movement and go back to 1840 a little later in the show, I know. But I want to start out talking about 1872 in particular, when Victoria Woodhull was the first woman to run for president in this country. This is a fact that a lot of people don\u2019t know for a variety of reasons, which is the whole purpose of our podcast, right, is to bring to light these people who have been written out of history, who weren\u2019t included in the first place and bring them to light. And so it was actually in 1872. And I\u2019m going to say that again, 1872, that we had the first woman run for president in this country. And my book chapter on her is called \u201cMedia Villainization of Victoria Woodhull.\u201d And she was completely demonized by the press. One of the articles written about her. This is what it said, \u201cHer connection with a movement damns that movement. She may be mad, but she\u2019s impure in thought and depraved in expression. Her ideas are not merely preposterous; they are revoltingly indecent and nasty.\u201d So this gives you an idea of how women who ran for political office way back then were vilified for even the thought of it. Now, some people may think, well, Victoria Woodhull, she was probably some third party no-name, right? And she was a third-party ticket, but she wasn\u2019t a no-name. She was extremely well known by people of that time period. She was the first woman to testify in front of Congress that women should be given the right to vote. She was very involved in the suffrage movement with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and with Susan B. Anthony. So this was a pretty prominent woman for her time. And she was referred to as being the Satanic ticket. She was referred as a fit subject for a lunatic asylum. And so women have been enduring these barriers dating all the way back then with them not seeming to be credible and, and being vilified in having sexist tactics used against them. And throughout my book, I go from 1872 up until the present. And I take a look at media coverage of, for example, Jeannette Rankin, the first woman elected to Congress, of Margaret Chase Smith, the first woman placed in nomination at a major political party\u2019s convention for the nomination of presidency, and then of course, I take a look at Sarah Palin as well, of course have, have studied media coverage related to Hillary Clinton, related to Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren, and study some of the more recent women. And, and throughout history, these women have had to endure these double standards, the sexism of their appearance and what they look like, and if they look proper enough. Of, if they\u2019re competent enough to have a role in politics. If they\u2019re too masculine and then they get the \u201cbitch\u201d word thrown at them, or if they\u2019re too feminine and then they\u2019re deemed incompetent. There is just always, always these extra barriers that they have had to overcome after all of these years, which is just why it is such a major moment to finally break these barriers. Nick Hirshon (07:31): Well, and then as you study all this media coverage, and you\u2019ve identified the major narratives that are used to vilify these women politicians over the years, with Kamala Harris, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been paying close attention since she was selected as the vice presidential nominee. What do you make of the media coverage of her so far and what should we be looking out for in these days and weeks and maybe years to come? Teri Finneman (07:52): Well, I mean, you\u2019re certainly seeing some of these same things play out with her, the, you know, vilification related to her policies. We had the article that was written about the shoes that she wore. Never have I come across an article about what a male vice president\u2019s shoes were. The, the rhetoric that she\u2019s angry, that she\u2019s a monster, which plays into the racist stereotypes of angry black women. And so she has certainly endured these same kind of things. And this is not something that just because we now have a female vice president will suddenly go away, right? Because this is something that is very much ingrained into our culture. We certainly have made progress since 2008 when both Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin were in the national spotlight. And there was suddenly much more recognition of the sexism that women in politics have to endure. And there\u2019s been a lot more discussion about how to deal with that especially since then. But look, when, when you have this since 1872, when you have the first woman elected to Congress in 1916 and that level of sexism didn\u2019t go away just before that, this is something that we, as a society, as a, as a culture really still need to come to grips with and deal with. Nick Hirshon (09:16): And you mentioned that you also study the history of suffrage and this year is the 100th anniversary of the adoption of the 19th amendment to the United States Constitution, which granted women the right to vote. So what do you think is the significance of Kamala Harris being elected in this year of all years, this anniversary year of the 19th amendment? Teri Finneman (09:34): I mean, that\u2019s certainly something that makes us even more emotional and, and adds an extra layer to it. I spent the past three years talking across the country about the history of the suffrage movement. I was focused actually specifically on the anti-suffrage movement, taking a look at the rhetoric of people who fought against giving women the right to vote, to try to understand why it took so long. The inklings of the movement actually began in 1840, although 1848 in Seneca Falls tends to be the main, you know, starting point that most people recognize. And from that point, right, 1848 to 1920, that\u2019s how long it took just to give women the right to vote in this country. And then at that point, of course, not all women got the right. It still ended up just being white women because women of color were still excluded for various reasons to try to, to suppress their vote, therefore leading to 1965 before the Voting Rights Act. And even until today, we still see voter suppression happening. But still regardless, the 19th amendment in 1920 was a major historical moment. And so for us to have the first woman as vice president elected in the same anniversary year is just amazing. I mean, this is almost like a movie, right? Like, you can\u2019t write this. And especially coming off of last year, 2019 was marking the 400th anniversary of slavery in this country. And so to have this extra pivotal moment of Kamala Harris, a black woman, receiving the vice presidency after, you know, essentially black women being excluded in 1920, all of the additional barriers, not only the sexism, but the racism that they have endured throughout our nation\u2019s history. I just can\u2019t overstate it enough, what a significant moment in history this is today. Nick Hirshon (11:46): And you\u2019ve obviously studied many women politicians over the years in the United States. And I wonder if you see some direct correlation, maybe some of the ancestors who led to, you know, what we\u2019re seeing today, because I mentioned before Geraldine Ferraro, who was the first woman to run as vice president on a major American political party ticket. You brought up Sarah Palin, of course, Hillary Clinton running for president. Now we have some rumors that Kamala Harris herself, right, might ascend to the presidency. Joe Biden has said that he views himself as a bridge to the next generation. She is 56 years old. He\u2019s in his late 70s. He\u2019s going to be one of the oldest people, right, to get into the White House. And so we look at what the future could hold and there\u2019s politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who are being viewed as potential nominees in the future. So do you see direct correlations between certain people in history that led to this moment with Kamala Harris? Or how do you see this maybe playing out in the future? Are there certain people you\u2019re looking at to be the next maybe presidential candidate as a woman? Teri Finneman (12:55): Well, I mean, certainly I should\u2019ve mentioned by now Shirley Chisholm, who was an absolute pioneer for black women in this country becoming the first black woman in Congress in 1968. And then of course launching her own presidential campaign in 1972. I think that she deserves way more analysis and attention than she has received in the past. And she is definitely an icon and a pivotal person to point to in this time. I also think that you have to give, and, and it is being given, you have to give a lot of credit to Stacey Abrams and what she did in, in Georgia to help with voter turnout there. I know that it was ultimately Pennsylvania that has tipped it today, but Stacey Abrams is definitely going to be an up-and-comer and somebody to watch in the next few years. But from the Republican side, you absolutely cannot count out Nikki Haley. I think that she is going to be a force to be reckoned with as well in the next presidential election. Nick Hirshon (14:02): And as we wrap up here, you know, you mentioned earlier the emotion that people are feeling, and I was just watching CNN and seeing Van Jones choking up as he\u2019s describing what this moment meant for him and meant for black Americans across the country. But for you as a woman who has studied the history of women politicians and seen how they\u2019ve been vilified, what kind of emotions are you just experiencing today? Teri Finneman (14:27): Yeah, you\u2019re trying to make me cry, aren\u2019t you? Clearly. I mean, it, it sounds really weird. But as a historian, you spend so much time studying these women and studying their biographies and, and you get attached to them. You feel like you know them. And so you almost feel the, the, the weight of Victoria Woodhull and Jeannette Rankin and Shirley Chisholm and Margaret Chase Smith and all of these women, the suffragists. You feel the presence of these women and how they would react today. You know, I think of Susan B. Anthony, who died before the 19th amendment was passed. These women who devoted their entire lives to making this possible for future women and how they aren\u2019t alive to see this today. And I just feel that empathy and how proud they would be, that they were somebody who helped make this moment happen for us today. And hopefully we as Americans can pay this forward in the future. Nick Hirshon (15:38): And I think it\u2019s come through to our listeners, but obviously people like Teri, scholars like myself, who spend so much time, years and years, devote entire careers to researching subjects. Obviously we pick those topics because we\u2019re personally passionate about them. And then as we do the research, we learn more about these historical figures, it becomes even more embedded in our own identities. So we feel this very directly. It can again, affect, you know, lots of aspects of our own emotions. So thank you so much, Teri, for joining us for this really special episode.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009. Biden was born and raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania, moving with his family to New Castle County, Delaware, in 1953 when he was ten. He studied at the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history after he was elected to the United States Senate from Delaware in 1972, at age 29. Biden was the chair or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years and was influential in foreign affairs during Obama's presidency. He also chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1987 to 1995, dealing with drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties issues; led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act; and oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. Biden was reelected to the Senate six times and was the fourth-most senior sitting senator at the time when he became Obama's vice president after they won the 2008 presidential election, defeating John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin. Obama and Biden were reelected in 2012, defeating Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan. During eight years as vice president, Biden leaned on his Senate experience and frequently represented the administration in negotiations with congressional Republicans, including on the Budget Control Act of 2011, which resolved a debt ceiling crisis, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which addressed the impending \"fiscal cliff.\" He also oversaw infrastructure spending in 2009 to counteract the Great Recession. On foreign policy, Biden was a close counselor to the president and took a leading role in designing the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011. In 2017, Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction. Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris defeated incumbent president Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence in the 2020 presidential election. He is the oldest president and the first to have a female vice president. Biden proposed, lobbied for and signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act to help the United States recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant recession. He proposed the American Jobs Plan, aspects of which were incorporated into the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was also signed into law. He nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. Biden proposed an expansion of the social safety net, but those efforts, along with voting rights legislation, failed in Congress. In foreign policy, Biden restored the U.S. into the Paris Agreement on climate change. He completed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. He responded to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia, as well as authorizing billions in foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine.

She is now two years into her term in a job that has been far from easy. But is the VP doing what is necessary to fulfill her role?   Kamala Harris' appointment as vice president of the United States was historic. She became the first woman, the first Black, and the first Asian ever to take on the role.\u00a0The White House seemed to embrace the new VP, using the tagline \"Biden-Harris Administration,\" on social media to underscore the importance of the second-in-command.\u00a0 But, in the months after Harris took office her leadership began to suffer. Reports soon emerged of a string of departures from key staff members and press coverage indicated the new VP was a demanding boss struggling to handle her political portfolio.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Exasperation and dysfunction: Inside Kamala Harris' frustrating start as vice president\" read one CNN headline.\u00a0 \"Kamala Harris: The absentee VP by design,\" wrote the online newspaper The Hill, which cited the leader's lack of solo press conferences and scant one-on-one interviews as evidence of her fading into the background. \u00a0 By her 11th month in office Harris' approval rating stood at 28% \u2014 10% below President Joe Biden.\u00a0\u00a0 However, while the public and media may have been dissatisfied with Harris' leadership, the vice president was doing exactly what was required of her, explained Amy Dacey, former CEO of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in an interview with DW.\u00a0 The US constitution outlines only two roles for a vice president: take over when a president is unable to serve, and preside over the US Senate. Everything else is an added duty.\u00a0 As president of the Senate, the vice president is designated to cast tie-breaking votes in the event of split decisions in the body. After the 2020 election the body was split evenly, 50-50 Democrats to Republicans (that balance shifted as a result of the 2022 midterms in which Democrats won a slim majority). This meant that Harris' vote was key to the Biden administration's legislative wins.\u00a0\u00a0 For example in August, Harris cast the tie-breaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, a federal law meant to fight inflation and promote domestic production.\u00a0To date, she has acted as a tie-breaker 26 times \u2014 topped by only two other vice presidents in US history (John C. Calhoun, 31; and John Adams, 29).\u00a0\u00a0 And, while Harris has presided over a divided US Senate on issues of pressing domestic and international importance, she has also been at the forefront of key diplomatic engagements abroad.\u00a0\u00a0 While the Trump administration adhered to an \"America First\" policy, the Biden administration has sought to return to diplomacy and ensure America is \"respected around the world,\" explained Amy Dacey.\u00a0 Harris has been a key diplomatic actor since taking office, attending the Munich Security Conference (MSC), for instance, a yearly meeting critical to trans-Atlantic relations. Delivering the keynote speech at the February 2022 installment of the MSC, she was vocal in stressing the Biden administration's support for Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0 \"If Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States, together with our allies and partners, will impose significant and unprecedented economic costs,\" Harris said.\u00a0 During her November visit to the Philippines, she underscored US support for the country in its territorial disputes with China.\u00a0\"We stand with you in defense of international rules and norms as it relates to the South China Sea,\" Harris told President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\u00a0\u00a0 Respect for the VP's international engagement is reflected in confidence in her leadership abroad. In a recent Pew Research Center survey roughly 55% of adults in 18 countries said they had confidence in her. That figure is on par with international confidence in US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, according to the survey.\u00a0\u00a0 However, as Harris has successfully served as a representative for the administration abroad, her domestic popularity has languished as she grapples with divisive tasks at home.\u00a0 To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Migration is a divisive issue among US politicians and the public, one that has been described as \"perilous\" and a \"political grenade\" by experts.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet that is one of the portfolios that Harris has been entrusted with by the Biden administration. Her foremost task has been to deal with the influx of migration of peoples into the US through Mexico and Central America's Northern Triangle \u2014 made up of\u00a0Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\u00a0 For her first foreign trip Harris traveled to Guatemala and Mexico in June of 2021, saying she wanted to address the \"root causes\" of migration.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come. Do not come,\" said Harris in a press conference with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei.\u00a0\u00a0 In response, US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a fellow Democrat, tweeted, \"This is disappointing to see.\"\u00a0 Republican lawmakers complained that Harris had not gone straight to the US-Mexico border. This September, Texas Governor Greg Abbott sent two buses of around 100 migrants and asylum seekers to the VP's home.\u00a0 \"We will continue sending migrants to sanctuary cities like DC until Pres. Biden & Border Czar Harris step up & do their jobs to secure the border,\" Abbott wrote on Twitter.\u00a0\u00a0 To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video While Harris has had to deal with challenging assignments, her leadership has been far from a failure, according to Amy Dacey, who suggests the pressure she faces from the public and fellow lawmakers may have less to do with job performance and more with who she is and how she is represented.\u00a0 Harris is dealing with the fact that she is both a minority and a woman in US politics. There are, for instance, no Black women currently serving in the US Senate, the very body she presides over. And politics in the US are also overwhelmingly male, especially in executive leadership \u2014 the United States has yet to elect a female president. This creates added difficulty for women trying to get into politics in the US. These \"often feel like they've had to prove themselves in ways that men have not,\" explained Kelly Dittmar, an assistant research professor at Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP) in an interview with DW.\u00a0\u00a0 In 2020, Harris ran against Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primaries but dropped out of the race citing a lack of financial resources.\u00a0Her exit had an added effect, according to Dittmer, who said Harris \"suffered from the perception that she was not ready, did not have the qualifications, was not electable as president.\" \u00a0 But running for office and losing is not at all unusual for those with presidential ambitions. Joe Biden ran for the office twice before being elected. He also served as vice president for eight years.\u00a0 Despite the wins and losses that have come with Harris' leadership, US politics do not happen in a vacuum. Each decision, engagement, and new legislation creates an incremental change even if the impact is not readily understood by the broader public, Amy Dacey explained.\u00a0 But these small wins often fall outside of Kamala Harris' main role as a vice president. A job that she may already be fulfilling.\u00a0\u00a0 Edited by: Jon Shelton"], "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-does-kamala-harris-believe-where-the-candidate-stands-on-9-issues": [" Support Intelligent, In-Depth, Trustworthy Journalism. \n\nDaniel Bush\n\n\n                    Daniel Bush\n                \n \n\nLisa Desjardins\n\n\n                    Lisa Desjardins\n                \n Kamala Harris is a barrier-breaking, first-term senator from California, a former district attorney and state attorney general, a devoted fan of Converse sneakers, and the co-founder of a dance group in high school called \u201cMidnight Magic.\u201d Harris is just the second African-American woman elected to the U.S. Senate. She sits on the powerful Senate Judiciary and Intelligence panels. If elected, she would be the first woman to win the White House, as well as the first black female president and the first president of Asian descent. Here is where Harris stands on key issues in the 2020 presidential election. As California\u2019s attorney general, Harris launched an investigation into Exxon Mobil in 2016, after reports that the oil and gas giant lied for decades about the risks of climate change. Harris criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Additionally, Harris opposed the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to reverse Obama-era fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks. Harris voted against repealing regulations on methane emissions, and has a 100 percent lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters, which tracks lawmakers\u2019 voting records on energy and environmental issues. Harris would enact the \u201cCollege for All Act\u201d proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. That would create a government funding program that would pay for tuition and fees at public colleges and universities for students with incomes of $125,000 a year or less. This would be funded by a fee on Wall Street firms of 0.5 percent per stock trade. She supports expanding Head Start and Early Head Start, and would create a \u201cnational universal prekindergarten,\u201d though she has not yet offered specifics for that plan. A self-described \u201cgood marksman,\u201d Harris is also a vocal supporter of increased gun control. She co-sponsored a bill to ban assault weapons and the sale of high-capacity magazines, defined as those which can fire more than 10 rounds without reloading. As California\u2019s attorney general, Harris defended a state law that blocked gun dealers from displaying signs that show or describe handguns. (The law was later overturned.) She also launched a statewide sweep to capture firearms from anyone illegally possessing them. Harris backs the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.  That bill would establish government-run health care system that allows every American to have access to care and end private health insurance as it currently exists. The bill would pay for that system in part with a 6.2 percent charge on employers, a 2.2 percent fee on most families that would vary at some income levels, increased marginal tax rates for incomes $250,000 and higher, increased taxes on capital gains, and an increased estate tax for the wealthiest. Harris has also introduced bills to increase access to mental health care and address high maternal mortality rates for black women. Regarding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Harris believes it\u2019s time to \u201cre-examine\u201d the agency and \u201cprobably think about starting from scratch.\u201d She has not joined other Democrats \u2014 including 2020 rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand \u2014 in explicitly calling for ICE to be abolished. Harris was a vocal opponent last year of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, which led to thousands of migrant children being separated from their families at the southwest border. Harris co-sponsored the \u201cREUNITE Act,\u201d legislation that aimed to reunite families separated at the border.  Also, Harris introduced a bill to improve oversight at immigration detention centers, and a bill to strengthen protections for unaccompanied migrant children in U.S. custody. Harris supports the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the Obama-era program protecting young undocumented immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. She opposes Trump\u2019s border wall proposals, and has called on the White House to end the shutdown and agree to reopen the government. A supporter of abortion rights, Harris voted against a bill that would limit abortions to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. As California state attorney general, she launched an investigation of anti-abortion activist David Daleiden, whose undercover videos later sparked charges of breaking privacy laws. His supporters said Harris\u2019 relationship with Planned Parenthood was a conflict of interest. On gay rights, Harris refused to defend California\u2019s law banning same-sex marriage while she was attorney general. She believes same-sex marriage should be legal and filed a court brief supporting transgender people\u2019s position that they should have access to the bathroom of their choice. She does not support states necessarily paying for gender reassignment surgery of transgender inmates, and once filed a court motion seeking to block the procedure in California. Harris has proposed the LIFT the Middle Class Act, which would give a $3,000 refundable tax credit to individuals making $50,000 or less and $6,000 for married couples earning under $100,000. She would pay for the multitrillion-dollar plan by eliminating some of the tax cuts put in place by the Republican-sponsored Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and by creating a new tax or fee on some banks and financial institutions. As a Senate candidate in 2016, Harris opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, arguing that the proposed trade deal with 11 Asian countries didn\u2019t do enough to protect workers and environmental regulations. (Trump pulled the U.S. out of the pact shortly after taking office). Harris has opposed the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and escalating trade dispute with China. Last year, she supported a bipartisan, non-binding resolution in the Senate that rebuked the Trump administration over its tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. Harris also co-wrote a letter with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer opposing U.S. tariffs on Chinese electronic goods, saying the tariffs would hurt California\u2019s economy. After a trip to Afghanistan last month, Harris said she supports a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d to the war that would allow U.S. troops to return home. She has not taken a public position on Trump\u2019s planned U.S. troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Syria. \nLeft:\n                Senator Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speaks to the media after announcing she will run for president of the United States at Howard University in Washington, on January 21, 2019.

But one question\u2014do your photos look soft toward the edges? If so, your lens might suffer from spherical aberration. The solution is simple. Use an aspherical lens. The surface of spherical lenses looks like it\u2019s part of a sphere or cylinder. The curve is the same across its entire surface. If you drew a line that follows the curve, it would form a circle. Because the design is simple, spherical lens designs are usually cheaper to produce. The surface of an aspherical lens can never be part of a sphere or cylinder. The curve changes in certain parts of the lens surface to focus the light better. This change in the surface corrects all kinds of aberrations. You should use an aspherical lens if you want to reduce spherical aberration in your images. Spherical aberration happens when light going through the camera lens focuses on different points. The light that hits the sides of a spherical lens focuses in front or behind the ideal focal point. This creates several focal points and causes spherical aberration. It\u2019s easy to recognize. The edges of your photos look soft and fuzzy at low f-numbers. That\u2019s usually a sign of spherical aberration. When stopping down, the fuzziness should decrease or even disappear. Camera lens manufacturers can solve the problem by adding more spherical lens elements. Another solution is to use aspherical lenses. Using aspherical glass lenses is more expensive. There is a problem when using several spherical lenses to correct spherical aberration. It reduces the contrast in a photo. It could also render colors differently. And you might notice more flare in your images. Aspherical lenses produce more colorful photos with better contrast.\n Aspherical means \u201cnot spherical.\u201d Its surface does not look like a part of a sphere. You can only check if a camera lens is aspheric by looking at the individual lens elements. Usually, an aspherical lens has spherical and aspherical glass elements. Yes, these camera lenses are more expensive lens designs than spherical lenses. But technology has improved. And you can get an aspherical glass for a reasonable price. If you find a cheap aspherical lens, that usually means it\u2019s made out of plastic. And you should avoid those. Spherical aberration isn\u2019t always a problem. When shooting portraits wide open, you won\u2019t even notice it. But when you need crisp and sharp photos, using aspherical lenses is the solution. Aspherical lenses are more expensive than spherical lenses. But a high-quality lens will last a lifetime, so it\u2019s worth the investment.

Kamala Harris\u2019 vice presidential nomination disproportionately focused on her race and gender, according to a report published by Time's Up Now, an organization founded in the wake of the #MeToo movement that aims to fight gender-based discrimination. A quarter of the analyzed coverage incorporated at least one racist or sexist stereotype \u2014 most of which derived from the repetition of President Donald Trump\u2019s ad hominem attacks on Harris. The report, released last week, compared media coverage of the announcement of Harris\u2019 nomination this year and 2016 coverage of the announcements of the vice presidential nominations of then-Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. The racist and sexist \u201cangry Black woman\u201d trope was the most prevalent stereotype in \u201cmainstream U.S. top-tier media coverage\u201d of Harris, emerging in 13 percent of the analyzed coverage surrounding the August announcement that she would be Joe Biden\u2019s running mate.

Some journalists also contributed to it \u2014 albeit less than Trump did overall \u2014 by characterizing Harris as \u201cuncooperative\u201d and \u201cunlikeable,\u201d the report noted. But most biased coverage resulted from mainstream news outlets perpetuating racist and sexist storylines: References to the \"birtherism\" conspiracy theory, for example, appeared in 10 percent of all coverage. By contrast, the 2016 veepstakes coverage overwhelmingly described Pence and Kaine as \u201cexperienced\u201d and \u201csafe\u201d choices \u2014 while Harris drew more negative adjectives, including sexist and racist language. At a time when the journalism industry faces its own reckoning over race and racism within the industry, the report shows the persistence of sexist and racist biases in both media and politics, and the unique blend of both that Black women experience \u2014 a combination dubbed \"misogynoir\" by Moya Bailey, an assistant professor of Africana studies and women\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies at Northeastern University. The report was published as part of Time's Up Now\u2019s recently announced nonpartisan We Have Her Back initiative, which aims to raise awareness of how sexism and racism affect coverage of female candidates. \u201cWhen women, and especially women of color, run for office, they are subjected to a double standard that has nothing to do with their qualifications and everything to do with this country\u2019s history of racism and sexism,\u201d Tina Tchen, the organization\u2019s president and CEO, said in a statement about the report. \u201cIt\u2019s time for women to be judged on their merits \u2014 and for the media to take a critical look at their biased coverage.\u201d The organization commissioned the research and analytics firm Edelman Data and Intelligence to compare how Harris, Pence and Kaine were portrayed in news media coverage during the week before, and the two weeks after, their announcements as running mates. The 661 articles, split between coverage in 2016 and in 2020, were sourced from news outlets including NBC News, ABC News, CNBC, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The New York Times and others. In the report, NBC was listed as one of the outlets that covered Harris\u2019s potential to help boost Black voter turnout in the South, published an op-ed on the biased rhetoric she would likely face on the campaign trail, and reported Trump's reaction to Harris's nomination by using language aligned with the \u201cangry Black woman\u201d stereotype. The \"angry Black woman\" trope that plagued Harris\u2019 characterization in a quarter of the analyzed coverage has deep historical roots, according to Treva Lindsey, an associate professor of women\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies at Ohio State University. Especially during Reconstruction, the trope served to continue the dehumanization of Black women following slavery and to reify white womanhood, Lindsey said. And 20th century pop culture portrayals of Black women strengthened its popularity, Lindsey added: In particular, the character of Sapphire in the radio and television sitcom \u201cAmos \u2018n\u2019 Andy,\u201d who was portrayed as nagging and aggressive, gave rise to a stereotype of the same name \u2014 which became a synonym for \"angry Black woman.\" The racist framing relies on a stereotypical \u2014 and sexist \u2014 notion of women\u2019s outsize emotionality, coupled with anti-Black racism, according to Soraya Chemaly, author of \u201cRage Becomes Her: The Power of Women\u2019s Anger\u201d and executive director of the Representation Project, an organization that aims to shift public attitudes about gender. \u201cWhat we see with the \u2018angry Black woman\u2019 trope is this inherent idea of irrationality, of extreme emotional response, and of unnecessary aggression,\u201d Chemaly said. Of the trope\u2019s intended impact on Harris\u2019 candidacy, Lindsey said it \u201cbecomes an easy way to dismiss her, discredit her, devalue her contributions to the political landscape.\u201d In her first joint interview with Biden since their announcement as running mates, Harris shied away from explicitly blaming Trump\u2019s attacks on racism and sexism, and instead characterized his descriptions of her as distractions from his administration. \u201cI think that there is so much about what comes out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth that is designed to distract the American people from what he is doing every day that is about neglect, negligence and harm to the American people,\u201d Harris told CNN in August. But when asked during the primary if she thought Trump was racist, Harris told the Root, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can reach any other conclusion.\u201d Trump\u2019s senior adviser, Katrina Pierson, has denied that Trump\u2019s attacks on Harris were motivated by racism or sexism, telling reporters in August that Trump and his daughter Ivanka donated a combined $8,000 as private citizens to then-prosecutor Harris when she ran for California attorney general. The report also found that while 61 percent of the analyzed coverage of Harris referred to her race and gender, only 5 percent of the 2016 coverage of Pence and Kaine mentioned their race and gender, underscoring the widespread acceptance of white men as the \"default\" model for leaders, it notes. Additionally, while Harris\u2019 racial background dominated coverage of the announcement of her candidacy, being mentioned in 36 percent of analyzed stories, Pence\u2019s and Kaine\u2019s professional backgrounds and accomplishments dominated the analyzed coverage announcing their candidacies. The dominance of the focus on Harris\u2019 ancestry in coverage is unsurprising, Lindsey said, given the historic nature of her candidacy as the first woman of color to be nominated for national office by a major political party. \u201cWe must acknowledge what it means that a Black and South Asian woman is the vice presidential nominee for the Democratic Party \u2014 that\u2019s a huge thing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we talk about these people running for offices, it\u2019s equally important to interrogate how whiteness has become the default and why, and how maleness has become the default and why.\u201d The Time's Up Now report notes that journalists can create more equitable coverage of political candidates by avoiding invoking identity in routine coverage, actively debunking political attacks rooted in racism and sexism, using gender-neutral language, and engaging third-party experts on gender, race and representation when possible. But the problem of inequitable news coverage is a systemic issue within the journalism industry, Chemaly said. She pointed to the fact that white men make up the majority of newsroom employees and produce the majority of political journalism in America, and therefore set the standards and norms for coverage. \u201cWe know that the experience of being a white man in that environment becomes conflated with humanity, objectivity and normalcy,\u201d Chemaly said. Journalists also must use more precise language to contextualize individual ad hominem attacks as racist, sexist and whatever other category of systemic discrimination they fall into, Chemaly added. To Lindsey, that requires distinguishing between the use of \u201crace\" and \u201cracism.\u201d \u201cWhen we talk about reporting on issues of racism, we need to name it as such,\u201d she said. \u201cRace is an identification; racism is a dynamic of power that\u2019s rooted in an identification of a person.\u201d Chemaly added that journalists should be more critical of the ways their own race, gender and other identities may affect their worldview and potentially the journalistic process. \u201cIn order for journalists to ethically and soundly change the way they\u2019re reporting, they first need to be introspective \u2014 they need to understand their own identities and understand how their own identities are implicated in their framing and sourcing of a story,\u201d Chemaly said. \u201cIt affects everything: what questions we ask, what photographs we use, the wording of our headlines.\u201d Follow NBCBLK on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. \u00a9\u00a02022 NBC UNIVERSAL"], "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/why-kamala-harris-nomination-pushing-academic-idea-further-mainstream-n1240717": ["  Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News When law professor Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw introduced the concept of \"intersectionality\" in a 1989 law journal article to describe how various forms of oppression based on categories of identity \u2014 like racism, sexism and classism, among others \u2014 overlap and \"intersect,\" it was decades from becoming the buzzword that it is today. Although she did not use the word \"intersectionality,\" Sen. Kamala Harris implicitly acknowledged her own intersectional identity in her speech at the Democratic National Convention last month, when she accepted the vice presidential nomination as Joe Biden's running mate. Of her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, Harris said: \"She raised us to be proud, strong Black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage.\" Harris' candidacy is historic in multiple ways: The daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, she is the first woman of color to be nominated for national office by a major political party, and she would be the first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president should she and Biden win the November election. But some activists say Harris' candidacy \u2014 and potential vice presidency \u2014 could also represent another type of sea change, by helping to popularize intersectionality as a national political framework by centering in policymaking the concerns of women of color that stem from their unique experiences at the intersection of racism and sexism. \"An intersectional framework allows us to tackle problems from an economic justice, gender justice and racial justice perspective,\" said Aimee Allison, founder and president of She the People, a national network that advocates for the concerns and involvement of women of color in politics. \"We know that effective governance requires us to approach the problems that we face from an intersectional lens.\" While Crenshaw introduced the concept of \"intersectionality,\" as a legal framework, she was not the first scholar to discuss the social implications of gender, race and class, said Mary Romero, author of \"Introducing Intersectionality\" and emerita professor of justice studies and social inquiry at Arizona State University. Other early proponents of intersectionality emerged in the 19th and early 20th centuries, including abolitionist and women's rights activist Sojourner Truth and investigative journalist and anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells-Barnett, as well as, later, sociologists including Deborah King and Patricia Hill Collins. \"What's significant about intersectionality is that it has activist roots, even in academia,\" Romero said. \"Those researchers that were interested in intersectionality wanted their knowledge to be able to change the world, not just explain the world.\" In her original 1989 article about intersectionality, Crenshaw argued that anti-discrimination laws, along with feminist and anti-racist movements, erased the unique experiences of Black women by failing to recognize the interlocking forms of oppression they face as a result of both racism and sexism. White women and Black men were widely recognized as victims of sexist and racist oppressions, respectively, but Black women and the challenges they faced were all but invisible in the eyes of the law and within even feminist work and Black-led anti-racist movements, according to Crenshaw. Two years later, Crenshaw published another related pioneering article in which she broadened the focus of her initial analysis of intersectionality to examine both the realities and the representations of violence against women of color more broadly, including Black, Asian, Latina and immigrant women, examining the unique systemic challenges and stereotypes each group faces. At the time, \"intersectionality'\" was also years from being implicitly targeted by President Donald Trump, given its status as one of the most significant components of critical race theory, which Trump called \"a sickness that cannot be allowed to continue\" in a Sept. 5 tweet. A day earlier, the White House announced that the president would prohibit departments from using federal funds to pay for executive branch agencies' diversity training programs that examine topics including critical race theory and white privilege. Crenshaw \"is part of a group of critical race theorists in the law who argue and have demonstrated that the law is not neutral and that it has its biases and that people don't experience the law in the same way,\" Romero said. While intersectionality began as a legal concept, it soon became a tool of analysis used to show the embeddedness of gendered and racial inequities across academic disciplines. And more recently, intersectionality has become a concept well-known outside university halls \u2014 including within activist movements such as the Women's March and the Movement for Black Lives, which have adopted intersectional policy platforms to focus on how forms of power and oppression manifest in systemic anti-Black racism. While intersectionality has been widely adopted within academia, in activist movements and in local and state politics, it has not been historically centered in national American politics, according to Allison and Romero. \"I think the misconception is that 'intersectionality' is 'diversity,' and it's not \u2014 intersectionality deals with power relationships and the way in which we experience subordination and domination in our lives,\" Romero said. \"It involves dealing with the larger system [of inequities], and that hasn't been very popular in American politics.\" Black women have rarely been centered in national politics \u2014 even within the Obama administration, Romero added. Intersectionality generally goes unrecognized and unnamed as a frame of analysis in mainstream national discussions about politics and policy, even though its relevance emerges in discussions about the economy, health care and mass incarceration \u2014 all of which affect women of color in particular, said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a political group that this month joined forces with three others to spend $10 million on digital advertising and messaging in key battleground states to counter racist and sexist attacks against Harris. \"The most common issues and the things that people say that they care about the most are in fact intersectional issues, and we just don't talk about them that way,\" Shropshire said. \"There is a tendency, because of sexism and misogyny that live in our society, to push those conversations off to the side.\" While intersectionality is about centering the needs of women of color and of marginalized people more broadly who face discrimination based on multiple categories of identity, building policies around Black women specifically \u2014 given their unique history of racism and sexism in America stretching back to slavery, along with their modern-day wage gap and high maternal mortality rates, among other forms of oppression \u2014 would highlight the similar challenges faced by other women of color, said Lakshmi Sridaran, executive director of South Asian Americans Leading Together, an organization that advocates for racial justice and the civil rights of South Asian people in the U.S. \"If Black women are centered in policymaking, then we will all benefit,\" Sridaran said. \"That is the other side of intersectionality. If those most impacted are centered, then the magnitude of transformation is also compounded and far more expansive.\" Allison said intersectionality also gives white women and other people who do not personally experience the unique combination of racism and sexism faced by women of color an analytical framework for understanding how women of color experience distinct, multiple and simultaneous forms of oppression. Intersectionality \"gives white women a new way to think,\" she said. \"There always have been people in this country who want to be part of a multiracial coalition. Intersectionality allows them a way in.\" Until recently, Harris tended not to discuss the different components of her identity, deflecting questions by insisting that she did not spend time thinking about it. \"When I first ran for office that was one of the things that I struggled with, which is that you are forced through that process to define yourself in a way that you fit neatly into the compartment that other people have created,\" she told The Washington Post last year. \"My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it.\" Harris expressed similar frustrations more than a decade ago. In a 2009 interview with the weekly newspaper India Abroad, she said her identity was the product not of a single influence, but of many. \"We have to stop seeing issues and people through a plate-glass window as though we were one-dimensional,\" Harris said at the time. \"Instead, we have to see that most people exist through a prism and they are a sum of many factors \u2014 everyone is that way, and that is just the reality of it.\" But in her interview with The Post last year, Harris added that she understood that voters want candidates for public office to share how their backgrounds shaped them. \"I appreciate that there is that desire that people have to have context, and I want to give people context,\" she said. For activists, Harris' newly publicly embraced identity alone is not enough to make her an intersectional candidate: She also has to prioritize intersectionality in her policymaking and in a potential Biden-Harris administration, they insist. Harris has insisted that she would use her identity to serve as a voice for the needs of Black women if elected. \"It is such a powerful and strong voice, the voice of Black women, and it needs to be heard,\" she told Essence last year. But in an interview with The 19th, a nonprofit news organization covering gender in politics, last month Harris acknowledged that her identity would not be enough to secure Black women's votes, insisting that her and Biden's platform addressed Black women's concerns. \"There will be a point of pride \u2014 you don't want to have any false modesty \u2014 about a Black woman being on the ticket, but it takes more than just that to motivate Black women to vote,\" she said. \"People have to speak to their issues, and the Biden-Harris ticket does that.\" But Harris' record serving Black women is imperfect. Critics point to her record of presiding over the arrests of parents \u2014 notably, mothers, according to HuffPost and The Orange County Register \u2014 of mostly Black truant students during her years as San Francisco's district attorney and California's attorney general. But activists and supporters of Harris say that intersectional policies that Harris has pushed in the past would directly respond to some of the economic and health-related issues that disproportionately affect women of color. That includes her support for monthly $2,000 direct cash payments during the coronavirus pandemic, which sent women's national unemployment rates higher than they had ever been in the more than six decades since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started tracking women's unemployment. The economy affected women of color particularly hard \u2014 in June, 15.3 percent of Latinas and 14 percent of Black women were unemployed, compared to 9 percent of white men. Harris has not publicly tied the proposal for cash payments to the challenges faced by women of color during the pandemic. But in The 19th interview, she reiterated her and Biden's plans to fund paid family leave, child care and elder care \u2014 the majority of which is done by women of color. \"Women carry a disproportionate burden for a lot of [care] responsibilities, so we need to recognize that and fix the problem,\" she said. Activists also note that Harris co-sponsored the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act this year to address the disproportionate Black maternal mortality rate \u2014 Black women in the U.S. are three to four times more likely to suffer pregnancy-related death than white women. The bill would direct federal agencies to establish task forces to examine and address the social determinants of maternal health and provide funding for community-based Black maternal health organizations, among other measures. Last year, Harris reintroduced the Maternal CARE Act, which she originally introduced in 2018, to tackle the Black maternal mortality crisis by introducing health care professionals to implicit bias training and establishing a state grant program to address high-risk pregnancies in areas with high and racially disparate rates of maternal deaths and illnesses. In a column for Essence this year, Harris wrote about the proposed package of bills and blamed racism for the disparities in maternal mortality rates between Black and white women. \"We must acknowledge that there are two problems when it comes to Black maternal mortality: ongoing systematic disparities and implicit bias,\" she wrote. But advocates also say neither Harris nor Biden have gone far enough in their plans to prioritize racial justice work or to guarantee federal health care for all. While Biden vowed in June to set up a police oversight body within his first 100 days in office to address \"institutional racism,\" research shows that many women of color want a more comprehensive approach to racial justice that goes beyond policing. A national survey conducted by She the People found that 52 percent of women of color respondents support establishing a White House Office on Racial Justice, an idea proposed by several women of color activists and elected officials. And 53 percent of those survey respondents also said they would be more enthusiastic about the Biden campaign if he came out with a plan to implement \"Medicare for All,\" as opposed to his proposal to preserve employer-based coverage while boosting subsidies and eligibility for coverage under the Affordable Care Act and adding a public marketplace option that people could buy into. Universal health care is, and has been, a particularly relevant concern for Black Americans because access to health care has largely been defined by race, and people of color are more likely to be uninsured than white people. And even when Black women have health care, they often face both racism and sexism. Black women, for example, have complained of doctors' not taking their pain seriously, in part because of mythologies stretching back to slavery arguing that Black people could bear more pain than white people. During the primary season, Harris vocalized a series of conflicting positions about her health care plan. Ultimately, Harris released a plan that positioned her to the left of Biden on health care by guaranteeing coverage to all Americans via a \"Medicare for All\" plan phased in over 10 years. Regardless of where activists say Biden and Harris still have room to improve when it comes to intersectionality, they characterize Harris' very presence on the Democratic ticket as an opportunity to center women of color \u2014 and intersectionality \u2014 in national politics. \"Her historic candidacy opens up more possibilities to force this conversation,\" Sridaran said. \u00a9\u00a02022 NBC UNIVERSAL"], "https://www.dcfs.louisiana.gov/page/snap-how-to-apply": [" Help us protect Louisiana's children.

In 1953, the Biden family moved from Pennsylvania to Claymont, Delaware. He graduated from the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School and served on the New Castle County Council. Then, at age 29, he became one of the youngest people ever elected to the United States Senate. Just weeks after the election, tragedy struck the Biden family, when Biden's wife, Neilia, and their 1-year old daughter, Naomi, were killed and their two young sons critically injured in an auto accident. Vice President Biden was sworn in to the U.S. Senate at his sons' hospital bedside and began commuting to Washington every day by train, a practice he maintained throughout his career in the Senate. In 1977, Vice President Biden married Jill Jacobs. Jill Biden, who holds a Ph.D. in Education, has been an educator for over two decades and currently teaches at a DC-area community college. The Vice President has three children: Beau, Hunter, and Ashley. Beau serves as Delaware's Attorney General and recently returned home from Iraq where he served as a Captain in the 261st Signal Brigade of the Delaware National Guard. Ashley is a social worker and Hunter is an attorney. Vice President Biden has five grandchildren: Naomi, Finnegan, Roberta Mabel (\"Maisy\"), Natalie, and Robert Hunter. As a Senator from Delaware for 36 years, Senator Biden established himself as a leader on some of our nation's most important domestic and international challenges. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for 17 years, then-Senator Biden was widely recognized for his work on criminal justice issues including the landmark 1994 Crime Bill and the Violence Against Women Act. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee since 1997, then-Senator Biden played a pivotal role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. He has been at the forefront of issues and legislation related to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, post-Cold War Europe, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia. Now, as the 47th Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden has continued his leadership on important issues facing the nation. \u00a0The Vice President was tasked with implementing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, helping to rebuild our economy and lay the foundation for a sustainable economic future. \u00a0As part of his continued efforts to raise the living standards of middle class Americans across the country, Vice President Biden has also focused on the issues of college affordability and American manufacturing growth, key priorities of the Administration. Vice President Biden continues to draw on his foreign policy experience, advising the President on a multitude of international issues. \u00a0He helped secure the Senate\u2019s approval of the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, together with significant new funding to maintain our nuclear laboratories. \u00a0He played a lead role in ending the war in Iraq responsibly, traveling to the country eight times since being elected \u2013 most recently in December 2011 to mark the formal end of the war.

In a competitive job market, it is important to make sure your resume stands out. Many candidates have similar-looking resumes so it\u2019s vital to give yourself every advantage possible. Highlighting honors and awards on your resume can be an effective way of achieving this. What\u2019s the difference between honors and awards? For the sake of writing a resume, the two words are interchangeable. Resumes often include an \u2018honors and awards\u2018 section with a list incorporating both. However, there is a small difference between\u00a0honors and awards in terms of definition. An honor is when someone is officially recognized and respected for their accomplishments. An award is a prize someone receives for something special they have achieved. The definitions are very similar and often something can be both an honor and an award. In terms of resume writing, there is no difference between honors and awards as they are included in the same section. It is not always necessary to include them and it is not the most important part of your resume. Both your work experience and your skills section should be more prominent. You should only include an honors and awards section if you have three or more items to include. Where should awards and honors go on a resume? If you have one or two you can include them in your professional experience section, or in your education section if they\u2019re academic awards. Remember that your resume should be concise. It should only be a page long which means you need to be selective about what you include. It may be the case that your experience and qualifications highlight why you a better suited for a position than your honors and awards. If this is the case exclude them. Don\u2019t waste valuable space. When should you include honors and awards on your resume? If you are a recent graduate and have received academic distinctions or achieved outstanding exam results, including them can be a way of making your resume stand out over hundreds of identical resumes. You should also add honors and awards which clearly demonstrate why you are the right person for the job. For example, if you are a hairdresser and received a \u2018Best Young Hairdresser Award\u2018, it will clearly help. You have to think whether a professional award is relevant. The same hairdressing award is unlikely to help someone applying for a job in a bank. However, if you are able to write a list of three or four honors and awards it will show that you\u2019re an adaptable achiever who possesses a range of skills. You should include honors and awards which highlight that you have the required technical hard skills for a job. These are easy to identify. However, you should also think about the soft skills that honors and awards highlight. Soft skills are abilities which are related to your personalities such as communication skills and social skills. It can be difficult to demonstrate soft skills on a resume but honors and awards can be a good way. Winning an award for giving a presentation at college shows that you have a range of different types of communication skills and it is much more convincing than simply stating that you\u2019re a good public speaker or have good communication skills. Similarly, if you have won any sporting awards for team sports, it demonstrates that you have strong teamwork skills. It can also show that you\u2019re determined, and even have leadership skills. You need to tailor your resume to each position in order to meet the individual specifications and requirements of each position. Using a resume builder is a time-effective way of achieving this.

The pair's goal was to gather evidence that Planned Parenthood, and other abortion providers, were selling tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. (Although it is unlawful \u201cto knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration,\u201d it is legal for patients to donate extracted material for medical research, and for providers to receive \u201creasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue\u201d as part of the donation process.) The CMP subsequently posted videos online which they claimed documented Planned Parenthood officials offering to illegally sell fetal tissue for profit, while Planned Parenthood maintained the videos were deceptively edited and captured only discussion related to legal reimbursements for tissue donation procedures. A text meme circulated during the 2020 presidential campaign held that California Attorney General Kamala Harris (who by 2020 was a U.S. senator and a Democratic vice presidential candidate) had unfairly prosecuted the CMP \"journalists,\" while taking no action against Planned Parenthood for \"selling aborted baby parts\":  That meme was both inaccurate and misleading. It is true that no charges were brought against Planned Parenthood in California \u2014 for the sound reason that Planned Parenthood was investigated by multiple states \u2014 but none of them found sufficient evidence to support a prosecution over claims that the organization had unlawfully sold (or offered to sell) human fetal tissue. As NPR reported, by the end of 2015, 12 different states had opened investigations into allegations that Planned Parenthood was \"selling body parts,\" and none of them turned up evidence of wrongdoing by that organization. (Another eight states, including California, decided not to pursue similar investigations.) On the other hand, after Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick asked the district attorney in Harris County to open a criminal investigation into Planned Parenthood in 2015, a grand jury there took no action against Planned Parenthood, but did find sufficient evidence to indict Daleiden and Merritt on felony charges (which were later dropped) of tampering with government records over their use of fake identification. In late 2019, a federal jury in San Francisco ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood in a civil lawsuit filed by that organization, rejecting arguments that Daleiden and Merritt were simply acting as investigative journalists, and ordering Daleiden, the Center for Medical Progress, and others, to pay Planned Parenthood $2.3 million in damages for violating federal and state laws by trespassing on private property and secretly recording video of others without their consent. In March 2017, Daleiden and Merritt were charged in California with 15 counts of violating state invasion of privacy laws that prohibit the recording of conversations without consent. A Superior Court judge dismissed some of those criminal charges, but another count was subsequently added in July, and several criminal counts remain current as of September 2020. Although then-Attorney General Harris was involved with the initial investigation of Daleiden and Merritt, she had left that office to take her seat in the U.S. Senate two months before charges were first brought against the pair by her successor, Xavier Becerra.

Your Cart is Empty View Cart  Known for its reliability, clarity and devotion to the needs of passionate photographers, Nikkor is on a quest to create the finest optics in the world. By adhering to the strictest requirements and testing both in the lab and across a wide range of actual shooting situations, Nikon creates state-of-the-art technologies that make Nikkor lenses the best choice for any type of still or moving imagery. Sharper Handheld and Low-Light Images When shooting distant subjects with a telephoto zoom or in low-light situations, where a slower shutter speed is required, even the smallest vibrations can cause your photo to become blurry. To combat this, Nikon has developed highly sophisticated Vibration Reduction (VR) image stabilization technologies in its interchangeable lenses. VR minimizes the blur caused by camera shake, to produce sharp images at slower shutter speeds, in low-light situations and when shooting handheld video. AF-S Nikkor lenses feature Nikon\u2019s Silent Wave Motor (SWM). This technology converts \u201ctraveling waves\u201d into rotational energy to focus the optics. This enables high-speed autofocusing that\u2019s extremely accurate and super quiet. Nikkor\u2019s ED glass lenses exemplify Nikon\u2019s preeminence in lens innovation and performance. This specialized glass is able to better focus the entire spectrum of color, nearly eliminating a color distortion called chromatic aberration that occurs in ordinary glass lenses. ED glass lenses produce remarkably sharp, high contrast images even with fast lenses at maximum aperture. Fluorite is a monocrystal optical material that features a high transmission rate within both the Infrared and Ultraviolet zones. With its superb anomalous dispersion properties, fluorite intensely blocks the secondary spectrum in order to effectively correct chromatic aberration within the visible light spectrum\u2014something that is more difficult to achieve at longer focal lengths. It is also significantly lighter than optical glass, giving you a more effective lens with less weight. Nano Crystal Coat is a revolutionary technology that dramatically reduces ghosting and flare and results in sharper, clearer, high contrast photos and videos. This low-refractive coating is comprised of microscopic nano particles and is far more effective than conventional anti-reflection coating systems. Nano Crystal Coat not only solves ghost effects caused by red light, which was incredibly difficult for previous systems, it also effectively reduces ghosting and flare effects caused by light entering the lens diagonally. The result: remarkably clearer images. Faster, More Compact Focusing When you focus a traditional lens, the lens barrel either gets longer or shorter. Nikon\u2019s Internal Focusing (IF) technology enables lenses to focus without changing in size, which is ideal for close-up work like Macro photography. This allows for a more compact, lightweight construction as well as a closer focusing distance. The IF system is featured in many Nikkor macro, telephoto and selected Nikkor zoom lenses. With Nikon\u2019s Rear Focusing (RF) system, all the lens elements are divided into specific lens groups, with only the rear lens group moving for focusing. This makes autofocusing operation smoother and faster. Optical Flaw Correction with Superior Resolution In 1968, Nikon introduced the first camera lens to use an Aspherical lens element. What sets them apart? Aspherical lens elements are lens elements with complex curved surfaces, where the radius of curvature changes to optimize light transmission and correct distortions that occur in \u201cnormal\u201d spherical lenses. Aspherical lens elements provide superior resolution performance and contribute to a lighter and smaller lens design. Flawless Glass is Born from Flawless Molding In the ongoing pursuit for excellence in lens manufacturing, Nikon developed a special molding technique effective for medium- to large-diameter Aspherical lens elements, which were previously considered to be difficult to mold. Precision Glass Molding (PGM) is the highly meticulous process by which optical glass is softened by heating, then shaped in an Aspherical mold made of special heat-resistant material. This technology has become widely adopted in the manufacture of Aspherical camera lens elements. The AF-S Nikkor 300mm f/4E PF ED is Nikon\u2019s first lens to use a Phase Fresnel element design within a DSLR camera lens. The Phase Fresnel optical design appears to have a series of concentric circles engraved on it, and these circles each focus a different spectrum and direction of light. The result is a substantially lighter, more compact lens with outstanding optical performance and prevention against ghosting and chromatic aberration. Remarkable Non-stick Glass Professionals need gear that can withstand the elements. Nikon\u2019s amazing fluorine coat effectively repels dust, water droplets, grease or dirt, ensuring easy removal even when they adhere to the lens surface. Compared to other manufacturers\u2019 coating of a similar kind, fluorine coat endures a higher frequency of lens surface wiping. Its anti-reflective effect also contributes to the capture of clear images.

Even though Joe Biden was vice president for eight years, it turns out some people didn't know the new president's middle name until he was sworn in on Wednesday. His full name is Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., and it's fair to say his middle name isn't a common one. It's his paternal grandmother's maiden name -- she was Mary Elizabeth Robinette before marrying Joseph Harry Biden. The president's father was their first child, Joseph Robinette Biden Sr, who\u00a0died in 2002 at age 86. It's far from the most unusual presidential middle name. President Warren Harding's middle name was Gamaliel, though he's best known as Warren G. Harding.\u00a0President Harry Truman's middle name was simply the letter S, and President Theodore Roosevelt didn't have a middle name at all. \"Huge day for Robinette visibility,\" tweeted Twitter user Ashley Feinberg. \"Shout out to all the Robinettes out there who've been living in the shadows. Your time has come, solidarity with the Robinettes.\" One tweet referenced the enormous dove pin singer Lady Gaga wore to the inauguration, playing off the robin part of the name. \"Robinette is what Lady Gaga was wearing,\" wrote one Twitter user.

After the 2010 Census, each member represented 18,529 residents. Members of the West Virginia House of Delegates serve two-year terms and are not subject to term limits. West Virginia legislators assume office the first day of December following the election.\n Section 12 of Article 6 of the West Virginia Constitution states, \"No person shall be a senator or delegate who has not for one year next preceding his election, been a resident within the district or county from which he is elected; and if a senator or delegate remove from the district or county for which he was elected, his seat shall be thereby vacated.\"[1]\n Section 13 of Article 6 of the West Virginia Constitution states, \"No person holding any other lucrative office or employment under this state, the United States, or any foreign government; no member of Congress; and no person who is sheriff, constable, or clerk of any court of record, shall be eligible to a seat in the Legislature.\"\n If there is a vacancy in the West Virginia State Legislature, the governor must select a replacement to fill the vacant seat.[2][3]\n For vacancies in the House of Delegates, the executive committee of the political party that holds the seat can submit a list of three candidates to the governor.  The list must be submitted to the governor within 15 days of the vacancy.  The governor must make a selection within five days of receiving the list.  If the committee does not submit a list within 15 days, the governor must appoint someone of the same political party as the person who left office. The person that is selected to fill the vacancy serves the remainder of the unfilled term.[3]\n For vacancies in the Senate, a gubernatorial appointment is required if less than two months and two years are left in the vacant senator's term.  A temporary gubernatorial appointment is required for any vacancy that has more than two months and two years remaining.  The person who is selected by the governor to fill the seat on an interim basis, serves until the next scheduled general election.  A special election must be held to determine a permanent replacement.  The executive committee of the political party that holds the vacant Senate seat is responsible for making recommendations to the governor on any appointment.[3]\n  See sources: West Virginia Const. Art. 4, Sec. 7 and West Virginia Code Ann. \u00a73-10-5\n \n West Virginia enacted district maps for the Senate and House of Delegates on October 22, 2021.[4] On September 30, 2021, the House Redistricting Committees released a single-member district map proposal for the West Virginia House of Delegates.[5] The proposal passed the House on October 13, 2021, in a 79-20 vote and passed the Senate on October 18, 2021, in a 28-5 vote.[6] On October 5, 2021, the Senate Redistricting Committee released five map proposals for West Virginia's State Senate districts.[7] On October 11, 2021, the Senate Redistricting Committee voted to recommend Sen. Charles S. Trump IV's (R) 8th proposed senate map to the full Senate.[8] The Senate approved a map that combined aspects of previous proposals in a 31-2 vote on October 19, 2021. The map, named after Sens. Trump, Tom Takubo (R), Eric Tarr (R)  Patricia Rucker (R), and Robert Karnes (R) was approved by the House in a 72-19 vote. Both the House and Senate maps were signed into law by Gov. Jim Justice (R) on October 20, 2021.[9] These maps took effect for West Virginia's 2022 legislative elections.\n On the Senate map, Sen. Trump said, \u201cThis amendment I believe reconciles and harmonizes some of the issues that were points of contention. This is the product of conversations and compromises over a long period of time by a great number of people.\u201d[10]\n \u201cThere is a faction within the Republican Party that is worried about their reelection when they shouldn\u2019t be. They should worry about how the state works and how to make it work,\" said Sen. Mike Romano (D).[11]\n How does redistricting in West Virginia work? In West Virginia, congressional and state legislative district boundaries are set by the West Virginia State Legislature. These lines are subject to veto by the governor.[12]\n The West Virginia Constitution requires that state Senate districts be \"compact, contiguous, and bounded by county lines where doing so is not otherwise unlawful.\" There are no such requirements in place for congressional or state House districts.[12]\n Click a district to compare boundaries.

In photography, a lens assembly that includes an aspheric element is often called an aspherical lens.\n The asphere's more complex surface profile can reduce or eliminate spherical aberration and also reduce other optical aberrations such as astigmatism, compared to a simple lens. A single aspheric lens can often replace a much more complex multi-lens system. The resulting device is smaller and lighter, and sometimes cheaper than the multi-lens design.[1] Aspheric elements are used in the design of multi-element wide-angle and fast normal lenses to reduce aberrations. They are also used in combination with reflective elements (catadioptric systems) such as the aspherical Schmidt corrector plate used in the Schmidt cameras and the Schmidt\u2013Cassegrain telescopes. Small molded aspheres are often used for collimating diode lasers.\n Aspheric lenses are also sometimes used for eyeglasses. Aspheric eyeglass lenses allow for crisper vision than standard \"best form\" lenses, mostly when looking in other directions than the lens optical center. Moreover, the reduction of the magnification effect of a lens may help with prescriptions that have different powers in the 2 eyes (anisometropia). Not related to the optical quality, they may give a thinner lens, and also distort the viewer's eyes less as seen by other people, producing better aesthetic appearance.[2]\n While in principle aspheric surfaces can take a wide variety of forms, aspheric lenses are often designed with surfaces of the form\n where the optic axis is presumed to lie in the z direction, and \n\n\n\nz\n(\nr\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle z(r)}\n\n is the sag\u2014the z-component of the displacement of the surface from the vertex, at distance \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n from the axis. The coefficients \n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha _{i}}\n\n describe the deviation of the surface from the axially symmetric quadric surface specified by \n\n\n\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u03ba\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n\n.\n If the coefficients \n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha _{i}}\n\n are all zero, then \n\n\n\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R}\n\n is the radius of curvature and \n\n\n\n\u03ba\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n\n is the conic constant, as measured at the vertex (where \n\n\n\nr\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r=0}\n\n). In this case, the surface has the form of a conic section rotated about the optic axis, with form determined by \n\n\n\n\u03ba\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n\n:\n The above equation suffers from strong correlation between the coefficients of the first term and the polynomial terms. This leads to strong divergences when it comes to fitting the equation to an aspheric surface. Therefore, different equations using \"Q-polynomials\" where coefficients are orthogonal to each other are an alternative that is sometimes used.[4]\n Small glass or plastic aspheric lenses can be made by molding, which allows cheap mass production. Due to their low cost and good performance, molded aspheres are commonly used in inexpensive consumer cameras, camera phones, and CD players.[1] They are also commonly used for laser diode collimation, and for coupling light into and out of optical fibers.\n Larger aspheres are made by grinding and polishing. Lenses produced by these techniques are used in telescopes, projection TVs, missile guidance systems, and scientific research instruments. They can be made by point-contact contouring to roughly the right form[5] which is then polished to its final shape. In other designs, such as the Schmidt systems, the aspheric corrector plate can be made by using a vacuum to distort an optically parallel plate into a curve which is then polished \"flat\" on one side. Aspheric surfaces can also be made by polishing with a small tool with a compliant surface that conforms to the optic, although precise control of the surface form and quality is difficult, and the results may change as the tool wears.\n Single-point diamond turning is an alternate process, in which a computer-controlled lathe uses a diamond tip to directly cut the desired profile into a piece of glass or another optical material. Diamond turning is slow and has limitations in the materials on which it can be used, and the surface accuracy and smoothness that can be achieved.[5] It is particularly useful for infrared optics.\n Several \"finishing\" methods can be used to improve the precision and surface quality of the polished surface. These include ion-beam finishing, abrasive water jets, and magnetorheological finishing, in which a magnetically guided fluid jet is used to remove material from the surface.[5]\n Another method for producing aspheric lenses is by depositing optical resin onto a spherical lens to form a composite lens of aspherical shape. Plasma ablation has also been proposed.\n The non-spherical curvature of an aspheric lens can also be created by blending from a spherical into an aspherical curvature by grinding the curvatures off-axis.  Dual rotating axis grinding can be used for high index glass that isn't easily spin molded, as the CR-39 resin lens is. Techniques such as laser ablation can also be used to modify the curvature of a lens, but the polish quality of the resulting surfaces is not as good as those achieved with lapidary techniques.\n Standards for the dispensing of prescription eyeglass lenses discourage the use of curvatures that deviate from definite focal lengths.  Multiple focal lengths are accepted in the form of bifocals, trifocals, vari-focals, and cylindrical components for astigmatism.\n Measurement technology plays a decisive role in the manufacturing of aspherical lenses. Depending on the manufacturing process and processing status, various measurement tasks are distinguished:\n A distinction is made between tactile, i.e. touching, and non-contact measurement methods. The decision as to which method is used depends on accuracy but also on manufacturing state.\n Tactile measurement is mainly used between two grinding operations to control the shape of the asphere and to adjust the following operation. A profile gauge probe is used to measure a section across the lens surface. The rotation symmetry of the lenses means that the combination of several of these profiles provides a sufficiently precise knowledge of the shape of the lens. Any damage to the lens surface caused by the probe tip would be removed in subsequent steps.[6]\n Interferometers are used when measuring sensitive or polished surfaces. By superimposing a reference beam with the beam reflected from the surface to be measured, error maps, known as interferograms, are created which represent a full-field deviation of the surface shape.\n Computer-generated holograms (CGHs) represent a method for the interferometric determination of the deviation of the lens from the nominal geometry. These generate an aspherical wavefront in the target shape and thus enable the determination of deviations of the lens from the target shape in an interference image. CGHs must be manufactured specifically for each test item and are therefore only economical for series production.\n Another possibility is the interferometric measurement of aspheres in subareas, with minimal deviations to the best-fit sphere, and subsequent combination of the submeasurements to a full-surface interferogram. These are very flexible in comparison to CGHs and are also suitable for the production of prototypes and small series.[7]\n Like other lenses for vision correction, aspheric lenses can be categorized as convex or concave.\n Convex aspheric curvatures are used in many presbyopic vari-focal lenses to increase the optical power over part of the lens, aiding in near-pointed tasks such as reading. The reading portion is an aspheric \"progressive add\". Also, in aphakia or extreme hyperopia, high plus power aspheric lenses can be prescribed, but this practice is becoming obsolete, replaced by surgical implants of intra-ocular lenses.  Many convex types of lens have been approved by governing agencies regulating prescriptions.\n Concave aspheres are used for the correction of high myopia.  They are not commercially available from optical dispensaries, but rather must be specially ordered with instructions from the fitting practitioner, much like how a prosthetic is customized for an individual.\n The range of lens powers available to dispensing opticians for filling prescriptions, even in an aspheric form, is limited practically by the size of the image formed on the retina. High minus lenses cause an image so small that shape and form aren't discernible, generally at about \u221215 diopters, while high plus lenses cause a tunnel of imagery so large that objects appear to pop in and out of a reduced field of view, generally at about +15 diopters.\n In prescriptions for both farsightedness and nearsightedness, the lens curve flattens toward the edge of the glass,[8] except for progressive reading adds for presbyopia, where seamless vari-focal portions change toward a progressively more plus diopter. High minus aspheres for myopes do not necessarily need progressive add portions, because the design of the lens curvature already progresses toward a less-minus/more-plus dioptric power from the center of the lens to the edge.  High plus aspheres for hyperopes progress toward less-plus at the periphery.  The aspheric curvature on high plus lenses are ground on the anterior side of the lens, whereas the aspheric curvature of high minus lenses are ground onto the posterior side of the lens. Progressive add reading portions for plus lenses are also ground onto the anterior surface of the lens. The blended curvature of aspheres reduces scotoma, a ringed blind spot.\n Aspheric elements are often used in camera lenses. This is often indicated by the abbreviation ASPH in the names of such products.\n In 984, Ibn Sahl first discovered the law of refraction, usually called Snell's law,[9][10][verification needed] which he used to work out the shapes of anaclastic lenses that focus light with no geometric aberrations.\n Early attempts at making aspheric lenses to correct spherical aberration were made by Ren\u00e9 Descartes in the 1620s, and by Christiaan Huygens in the 1670s; the cross-section of the shape devised by Descartes for this purpose is known as a Cartesian oval. The Visby lenses found in Viking treasures on the island of Gotland dating from the 10th or 11th century are also aspheric, but exhibit a wide variety of image qualities, ranging from similar to modern aspherics in one case to worse than spheric lenses in others.[11] The origin of the lenses is unknown, as is their purpose (they may have been made as jewelry rather than for imaging).[11]\n Francis Smethwick ground the first high-quality aspheric lenses and presented them to the Royal Society on February 27, 1667/8.[12] A telescope containing three aspheric elements was judged by those present \"to exceed [a common, but very good telescope] in goodness, by taking in a greater Angle and representing the Objects more exactly in their respective proportions, and enduring a greater Aperture, free from Colours.\"[12] Aspheric reading and burning glasses also outdid their spherical equivalents.[12]\n Moritz von Rohr is usually credited with the design of the first aspheric lenses for eyeglasses.  He invented the eyeglass lens designs that became the Zeiss Punktal lenses.\n The world's first commercial, mass-produced aspheric lens element was manufactured by Elgeet for use in the Golden Navitar 12\u00a0mm f/1.2 normal lens for use on 16\u00a0mm movie cameras in 1956. (See Image sensor format.) This lens received a great deal of industry acclaim during its day. The aspheric elements were created by the use of a membrane polishing technique.[citation needed]\n The first 35\u00a0mm camera lens with an aspheric lens element was the Fisheye-Nikkor 10\u00a0mm f/5.6 OP introduced in 1968.[13]\n The optical quality of a lens system can be tested in an optics or physics laboratory using bench apertures, optic tubes, lenses, and a source.  Refractive and reflective optical properties can be tabulated as a function of wavelength, to approximate system performances; tolerances and errors can also be evaluated.  In addition to focal integrity, aspheric lens systems can be tested for aberrations before being deployed.\n The use of interferometers has become a standard method of testing optical surfaces.  Typical interferometer testing is done for flat and spherical optical elements.  The use of a null corrector in the test can remove the aspheric component of the surface and allow testing using a flat or spherical reference.\n Trilobites, one of the earliest types of animal with sophisticated eyes, had lenses with two aspheric elements.[14]\n"], "https://blog.collegevine.com/reporting-honors-and-awards-in-the-common-app/": ["  Our chancing engine factors in extracurricular activities, demographics, and other holistic details.

Our chancing engine factors in extracurricular activities, demographic, and other holistic details. We\u2019ll let you know what your chances are at your dream schools \u2014 and how to improve your chances! Honors are a great way of distinguishing yourself from other applicants, especially at top-tier schools, where most applicants have high test scores and excellent GPAs. An honor refers to any award or achievement you received at any point during your four years of high school. So even if you aren\u2019t a National Merit Scholar, chances are you\u2019ve received some kind of recognition worth mentioning. \u00a0 The Honors section appears in the Education section of the Common App. First, it will ask you how many honors you wish to list. Because you are limited to five, you may need to choose the ones that are most important to you, or those that best represent your academic achievements. \u00a0 If you need more space to list other honors, include your most impressive and relevant achievements in the Honors space, and use the additional information section to discuss other awards, or consider sending a resume as a supplement to your application.\u00a0You should aim to fill out all five spaces available, even if you are including fairly common honors, such as Honor Roll. \u00a0 You are allowed 100 characters to describe each honor. If it is a common award such as National Merit Scholar, you won\u2019t need to elaborate any further on the application, since colleges will be familiar with the distinction. You should designate which type of award you received, though (i.e., Commended Student, Semifinalist, Finalist, or Scholar). \u00a0 However, if the award is particular to your school, or is something that may not be self-explanatory, you may need to describe it a bit more. For example, if you received an award for your performance in Latin at your high school, you might list it as \u201cMarcus Jones Award \u2014 awarded to a junior for excellence in Latin.\u201d \u00a0 If there is a large pool from which recipients are chosen, mention the number of candidates and indicate the competitiveness. If there is a monetary award tied to the honor, mention the exact figure as well, such as \u201cSmith Library Scholarship for Excellence in Writing \u2014 $5,000.\u201d You should also list non-monetary prizes associated with the honor. For example, if you won an award for your artwork that enabled it to be showcased in an exhibit, mention that. Overall, try to be as specific as possible within the space available. Avoid using acronyms unless they are widely known. \u00a0 Next, you will be asked to designate the grade level in which you received the honor. This is fairly straightforward. If you received a particular award in multiple grades, you can check off as many grades as apply here. If you received an award during the summer, designate the rising grade. For example, if you won a writing competition the summer before your sophomore year, you would check 10th grade. \u00a0 You will also be asked to designate the level of recognition: School, State/Regional, National, or International. This list is in ascending order of importance, meaning that an international award is considered the highest level of honor, because the domain of students eligible for the award is the largest at this level. If you are unsure of which level of recognition you received, consider the pool of candidates who could have received it. \u00a0 A school award indicates that the students in your high school were eligible; a state or regional award means that people in your state, beyond just your school, could have won; national refers to honors students in your country could have received; and an international award is any honor for which the candidate pool spans more than one country. List your honors in order of descending importance, with the most selective or competitive (such as international awards) at the top, before state/regional and school awards. \u00a0 Are you applying to schools and want to know your admissions chances?\u00a0Calculate your chances right now and understand your odds before applying. You may be wondering which awards you should list in the Honors section and which ones you should list in the Activities section, since you are asked to list awards won under those activities as well. \u00a0In general, you should list an honor or award in the Activities section if it can be directly tied to a specific activity mentioned. \u00a0 For instance, if you receive a varsity letter for basketball, you should list it under your basketball entry in the Activities section. Similarly, if you place first in a Mathletes competition in which you participate as part of Mathletes club, you should list that under your Mathletes entry in Activities. \u00a0 However, if you receive an honor that isn\u2019t tied to a particular extracurricular activity, or is associated with a class, this type of award should be included in the Honors section. That includes scholarships and contests that aren\u2019t awarded within the context of an extracurricular activity. For example, if you win a statewide essay contest for a piece you wrote for your English class or on your own, you should list that award here. \u00a0 Feel free to break this rule if you have trouble filling the five slots in your Honors section. In that case, you can list an award you received through an extracurricular activity as an honor instead. \u00a0 Similarly, if you have won numerous awards through a particular extracurricular, you may want to highlight a particular achievement, as well as keep to the character limit in the Activities section, by including it in the Honors section. \u00a0 For example, if you won a national saxophone competition and have been selected for All-State Band and All-State Jazz Band, as well as performed at Carnegie Hall, you may want to include the honor you deem most significant in the Honors section. Of course, you should never make up an honor \u2014 that is an ethical violation and could result in a severe penalty.

Our chancing engine factors in extracurricular activities, demographic, and other holistic details. We\u2019ll let you know what your chances are at your dream schools \u2014 and how to improve your chances! Prestigious and highly selective summer programs, such as Research Science Institute, Boys Nation and Girls Nation, Summer Science Program (SSP), Telluride Association Summer Program (TASP), and the Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists (PROMYS), can be included in either the Honors section or Activities section, depending on how many slots you have filled in each. However, if you have a lot to say about your involvement in a particular program, you should probably include it in Activities, where you have more space to describe it. \u00a0 Ultimately, you want to leave as few holes in your application as possible, as well as present the most comprehensive picture of yourself. Doing so may require some juggling and shifting of entries. Other than for the grades and testing sections, there are few hard and fast rules about what to include and where it should go, so if you find yourself short of awards but with a surplus of extracurriculars, move some activities around. \u00a0 Because some national honors are fairly common among high-achieving students, you may not need to highlight these in your application. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t include them at all; you just may want to add them to the additional information section or your resume instead of using one of your five Honors spaces. \u00a0 In general, National Honor Society (NHS) should be included in the Activities section, especially if you made a meaningful contribution to the club, no matter if it was in the form of leadership, community service, etc. That way you will be able to describe in further detail how you contributed to the group. \u00a0 If you don\u2019t want to use one of your ten allotted activities spaces for NHS, add it to the additional information section. If you didn\u2019t do much for the club and haven\u2019t used all five of the available spaces in the Honors section, you could also add it there. You should designate it as a school-level award because the pool from which you are chosen for the club is comprised of students at your high school. \u00a0 If you have fewer than five awards listed in your Honors section, feel free to include a National Merit designation here. Commended Student and Semifinalist should be listed at the state level, while Finalist and Scholar should be listed at the National level. However, if you have five awards that are less common and more impressive than a National Merit award, you may choose to include it in the additional information section or your resume. It will already be clear that you have high test scores from your SAT or ACT. \u00a0 Some awards, like AP Scholar, are reported by the institution granting them, such as College Board. Of course, if you have room, you can still list these in the additional information section, and if they are particularly selective or uncommon, in the Honors section. However, if you don\u2019t have enough room, keep in mind that you don\u2019t necessarily need to include them twice. Check with the institution granting the award or your guidance counselor if you are unsure about whether or not a particular award is reported independently. \u00a0 Still have questions about filling out the Common Application?

Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.\u00a0(/\u02c8ba\u026ad\u0259n/\u00a0BY-d\u0259n; born November 20, 1942) is an American politician. He previously served as the 47th\u00a0vice\u2005president\u2005of\u2005the\u2005United\u2005States\u00a0in the\u00a0Obama\u2005administration\u00a0from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he and running mate Kamala Harris defeated the incumbent president\u00a0Donald\u2005Trump in the\u00a02020\u2005presidential election.\n Biden was born on November 20, 1942, at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania,[1] to Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Biden (n\u00e9e Finnegan; 1917\u20132010)[2] and Joseph Robinette \"Joe\" Biden Sr. (1915\u20132002).[3] He was the first of four siblings in a Catholic family, with a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, James and Frank, following.[4]\n Joseph Sr.'s parents, Mary Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Robinette) Biden (1894\u20131943) and Joseph Harry Biden (1893\u20131941),[38][39] an oil businessman from Baltimore, Maryland, were of English, French, and Irish descent.[40][2]:8\n Biden's paternal third great-grandfather, William Henry Biden (1789\u20131849), was born in England and emigrated to the United States, where he settled in Maryland. According to historian Eddy Greenfield, he was born in Sussex,[41][42] and was christened at St John the Baptist's Church, Westbourne in Westbourne, West Sussex on 8 March 1789.[42] William Henry was the second child and son of James Biden (born November 1767) and Ann Silverlock (born March 1766), who had married on 16 May 1785. James Biden, Biden's paternal fourth great-grandfather, was from Pagham. He was the son of Richard Biden, Biden's paternal fifth great-grandfather, and his wife Susan, beyond which the paternal family line cannot be traced.[42]\n A possible connection may also exist to the family of a William Henry Biden (1791\u20131843), who was from Houghton, Cambridgeshire.[43] This William Henry was the son of a John Biden (died 28 July 1796) and his wife Ann Beaumont, who had married in 1781.[43] The seventh of eight children and the family's fifth son,[44] William Henry and his elder brother Christopher Biden (1789-1858) served as officers in the East India Company merchant marine, both eventually becoming captains of East Indiamen. William Henry commanded mid-sized vessels before his death at Rangoon in 1843.[45]\n Christopher Biden subsequently became an official in the Madras Civil Service (later the Indian Civil Service), and his descendants settled in India. He died at Madras in 1858.[45] In 1981, Christopher's fourth-great-grandson Leslie Dunn Biden, then living in Nagpur, wrote to Joe Biden about the possible family connection after reading about him in the Illustrated Weekly of India, He received a response from Joe, and after discussing their genealogy, both promised to stay in touch, but did not resume correspondence before Leslie's death in 1983.[44] During a 2013 visit to India, Joe Biden referred to Leslie's letter, mentioning a \"Biden from Mumbai\" had suggested their \"mutual great-great-great-great-something-or-other\" named George had \"worked for the East India Company back in the 1700s.\"[45]\n \n Jean's parents were Geraldine Catherine Blewitt (1887-1949) and Ambrose Joseph Finnegan (1884-1957), an advertising salesman from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Jean was of Irish descent, with roots variously attributed to County Louth and County Londonderry.\n Irish genealogists presented Joe Biden with his Irish maternal family history on his visit there in 2016. With Joe Biden having a great-great-grandfather (Patrick Blewitt) and a great-grandfather (James Finnegan) being born in Ireland, this makes Joe Biden 18.75% Irish.\n \n \n\n \n \n Biden's father had been very well-off earlier in his life, but suffered several business reversals by the time Biden was born. For several years, the family had to live with Biden's maternal grandparents, the Finnegans.[5] When the Scranton area went into economic decline during the 1950s, Biden's father could not find enough work.[6] In 1953, the Biden family moved to an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, where they lived for a few years before moving to a house in Wilmington, Delaware.[5] Joe Biden Sr. then did better as a used car salesman, and the family's circumstances were middle class.[5][6][7]\n Biden became an attorney in 1969, and was elected to the New Castle County council in 1970. Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972, and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history.\n \n \n \n \n \n ==\n  -->\n Footnotes\n Books\n \n \u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAMK152\n"], "https://familypedia.fandom.com/wiki/Joseph_Robinette_Biden_(1915-2002)": [" \n\nJoe Biden, Sr\u00a0\u2021\n\nBirth:\n13 November 1915 Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Maryland, United States\n\n\nDeath:\n2 September 2002 Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware, United States\n\n\nRemains:\n9999 Saint Joseph on the Brandywine Cemetery, New Castle County, Delaware\n\n\nFather:\nJoseph Harry Biden (1893-1941)\n\n\nMother:\nMary Elizabeth Robinette (1894-1943)\n\n\nSkills:\nbusinessman\n\n\nSpouse / partner:\nCatherine Eugenia (Jean) Finnegan (1917-2010)\n\n\nWedding:\n30 May 1941 Scranton, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, United States\n\n\nSex:\n\n\n\n Edit Facts \n\n\nJoseph Robinette Biden, Sr. was born 13 November 1915 in Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Maryland, United States to Joseph Harry Biden (1893-1941) and Mary Elizabeth Robinette (1894-1943) and died 2 September 2002 Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware, United States of unspecified causes.

In an interview that aired on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d program on Tuesday, Harris claimed she is working to \u201cidentify the problem\u201d occurring at the U.S-Mexico border to solve it. \u00a0 Harris, who was put in charge of the border crisis by Joe Biden over two months ago was asked by Holt about her plans to visit the southern border. With a straight face (well as straight as the cackling, obnoxious Harris can get), she said that the administration had indeed been to the border, while Holt pushed back that she has not. \u201c[T]he question that has come up, and you heard it here, and you\u2019ll hear it again, I\u2019m sure, is, \u2018Why not visit the border? Why not see what Americans are seeing in this crisis?\u2019\u201d Holt asked her. \u201cWell, we are going to the border. We have to deal with what\u2019s happening at the border. There\u2019s no question about that. That\u2019s not a debatable point. But we have to understand that there\u2019s a reason people are arriving at our border and ask what is that reason, and then identify that problem so we can fix it,\u201d Harris replied. A short time later, Holt got around to pressing Harris on whether she planned on going to the border. \u201cDo you have plans to visit the border?\u201d he asked Harris. \u201cAt some point, you know, we\u2019re going to the border. We\u2019ve been to the border. So, this whole\u2026thing about the border. We\u2019ve been to the border. We\u2019ve been to the border,\u201d Harris, clearly flustered answered. So, what is it? You\u2019re \u201cgoing to the border\u201d or you\u2019ve \u201cbeen to the border?\u201d Holt pushed back, \u201cYou haven\u2019t been to the border.\u201d Engage cackling, uncomfortable laugh. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t been to Europe,\u201d Harris cackled in her cackly best. \u201cAnd I mean, I don\u2019t understand the point you\u2019re making. I\u2019m not discounting the importance of the border.\u201d Dear Kamala\u2026we don\u2019t have a border crisis with Europe! The point Holt was making (which he refused to continue to press Harris on) was the fact that SHE was put in charge of the administration\u2019s response to the crisis at the border and SHE has not been within 1,000 miles of the border since. \u201cI care about what\u2019s happening at the border,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m in Guatemala because my focus is dealing with the root causes of migration. There may be some who think that that is not important, but it is my firm belief that if we care what\u2019s happening at the border, we better care about the root causes and address them. And so, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d To Harris\u2019 credit, she did go to the southern U.S. border\u2026at 37,000 feet in Air Force Two as she flew OVER it.\u00a0 Jesse Watters of Fox News had a great analogy for Harris\u2019 ridiculous flippant statement about \u201croot causes.\u201d He related what would happen if his wife came home and found there were bees in the house because he had left the door open. \u201cShe says \u2018Jesse, there\u2019s bees in the house, do something.\u2019 And I say, \u2018I\u2019ll take care of this. I am going to deal with root causes,\u2019\u201d he continued, saying he would leave the house, leaving the door open to go over to a neighbor\u2019s house and talk to him about his beehive. \u201cThat\u2019s what Kamala Harris is doing. She\u2019s wasting time at the neighbor\u2019s house talking about a beehive. All we wanted her to do was to go to the door and close the door,\u201d Watters continued. \u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, Fox News host Tucker Carlson accused Harris of \u201cbribing\u201d Central Americans to stay in their home countries, the Daily Mail reported. \u00a0Watch the latest video at foxnews.com \u201cHarris flew to Guatemala to unveil her policy to address the crisis. What is it? In a word, the plan is bribery. The administration plans to spend billions of dollars to pay Latin America\u2019s poor not to move to the United States. CNN loves the idea of course. It blames America.\u201d Carlson then went on to slam Harris\u2019 blaming of everything but the real reason for the border surge\u2014the Biden administration\u2019s open borders rhetoric. \u201cKamala Harris is no genius, but\u2026she knows more bribes won\u2019t work. So instead of defending her plan on the specifics, she\u2019s taking the easier and far more familiar road\u2026more babbling about racism, and sexism, and of course, climate change.\u201d He then played a clip of the feckless vice president blaming \u201cviolence against women, indigenous people, LGBTQ people, and Afro-descendants\u201d for the influx of illegal migration to the southern border. Which is of course absurd. She probably can\u2019t laugh her way out of this one.

For more on that original report, we invite you to: DIG DEEPER WASHINGTON, DC \u2014 President Joe Biden has now delegated his leadership role in the growing illegal immigration crisis at the Texas border to Vice President Kamala Harris, who is increasingly being tasked with more presidential-like duties. This past week, Biden\u00a0appointed\u00a0Harris to lead his administration\u2019s efforts to address a record surge in migrants, including unaccompanied minors, which have strained capacity at immigration facilities at the southern border in recent weeks. Biden said in his White House announcement: \u201cI can think of nobody who is better qualified to do this.\u201d President Joe Biden taps @VP Kamala Harris to lead on immigration amid border crisis https://t.co/PM2w9rYvop pic.twitter.com/z1LgsN87Zm \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) March 24, 2021  Referring to Harris, Biden said: \u201cWhen she speaks, she speaks for me. Doesn\u2019t have to check with me. She knows what she\u2019s doing and I hope we can move this along.\u201d Harris will serve as the administration\u2019s diplomatic liaison in talks with Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and try to address the root causes of the migrant surge. .@POTUS asked me to lead our diplomatic work with Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. To address the situation at the southern border, we have to address the root causes of migration. It won\u2019t be easy work\u2014but it's necessary. \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) March 25, 2021  Harris said to Biden: \u201cThank you, Mr. President, and for having the confidence in me. There\u2019s no question this is a challenging situation.\u201d https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1374805707069984770 However, Harris is being criticized by some as a poor choice to lead the border crisis response. She has been accused of flip-flopping on the issue of decriminalizing illegal crossings and comparing ICE to the KKK, according to FOX News reports. THREAD Today when discussing the border crisis, Joe Biden said of Kamala Harris, \"When she speaks, she speaks for me.\" Given Harris' far-left immigration positions, that should concern every American. In 2018, Harris compared ICE officers to the KKK.pic.twitter.com/h1iW3UG52W \u2014 Tommy Pigott (@TommyPigott) March 25, 2021  On \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Thursday morning, former Acting ICE Director,\u00a0Tom Homan,\u00a0slammed Vice President\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0as the \u201cworst pick\u201d to lead the response to the current\u00a0border crisis\u00a0under the\u00a0Biden\u00a0administration.

Homan said: \u201cWhen President Biden says [Kamala Harris] is the most qualified, I mean, seriously? What color\u2019s the sky in his world? Because you couldn\u2019t get a worse pick. Look, she supports sanctuary cities, she wrote legislation to reward those who illegally entered into the United States.\u201d Homan further added: \u201cShe vilified the men and women of the Border Patrol during the last surge, saying they are mistreating immigrants. She\u2019s an open borders advocate. She wants to abolish ICE and she compared immigration officers to the KKK during the Senate hearing, and you want to put her in charge of immigration enforcement on the border? \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a worse choice.\u201d Joe Biden , the guy who was friends with and did the eulogy of the KKK wizard Robert Byrd is ending racism?

Spherical aberration is commonly seen in spherical lenses, such as plano-convex or double-convex lens shapes, but aspheric lenses focus light to a small point, creating comparatively no blur and improving image quality. Spherical aberration is inherent in the basic shape of a spherical surface and is independent of alignment or manufacturing errors; in other words, a perfectly designed and manufactured spherical lens will still inherently exhibit spherical aberration. An aspheric lens can be designed to minimize aberration by adjusting the conic constant and aspheric coefficients of the curved surface of the lens. Figure 1 shows a spherical lens with significant spherical aberration compared to an aspheric lens with practically no spherical aberration. The table below further illustrates the difference in focusing performance between an aspheric lens and a spherical lens, contrasting the performance of two comparable lenses with 25mm diameters and 25mm focal lengths (f/1 lenses). The table compares the spot size, or blur size, of collimated 587.6nm light rays on-axis (0\u00b0 object angle) and off-axis (0.5\u00b0 and 1.0\u00b0 object angles). The spot sizes from the asphere are several orders of magnitude less than those of a spherical lens. To achieve the required performance of an imaging lens, optical designers often have to stop down, or increase, the f/# of their design. While this may achieve the desired resolution goal, this technique results in a loss of light throughput. Utilizing aspheric lenses in the design, however, improves aberration correction and makes it possible to design high throughput systems with low f/#s, while simultaneously maintaining good image quality. The table below compares an 81.5mm focal length, f/2 triplet lens (shown in Figure 2) consisting of all spherical surfaces, versus the same triplet with an aspheric first surface. Both designs use the same glass types, effective focal length, field of view, f/#, and total system length. The table quantitatively compares the modulation transfer function (MTF) @ 20% contrast of on-axis and off-axis collimated, polychromatic light rays at 486.1nm, 587.6nm, and 656.3nm. The triplet lens with the aspheric surface shows greatly increased imaging performance at all field angles as indicated by high tangential and sagittal resolution values, by factors as high as four, compared to the triplet with only spherical surfaces. Aspheric lenses allow optical designers to correct aberrations using fewer elements than conventional spherical optics because the former gives them more aberration correction than multiple surfaces of the latter. For example, in zoom lenses where ten or more lens elements are typically used, two aspheric lenses can be substituted for a handful of spherical lenses in order to achieve similar or better optical results, while reducing system size and potentially reducing the overall cost of production. The term asphere encompasses any lens with surfaces that are not portions of a sphere. However, when we use the term here we are specifically talking about the subset of aspheres that are rotationally symmetric optics with a radius of curvature that varies radially from the center of the lens. As discussed earlier, aspheric lenses improve image quality and reduce the number of required optical elements. From smart phones and laser-enabled devices to high-end microscope objectives and surgical equipment, aspheric lenses are increasingly critical to every facet of the optics, imaging, and photonics industries due to the distinct advantages that they offer compared to traditional spherical optics. Aspheric lenses have been traditionally defined with the surface profile (sag) given by Equation 1: Where:$ Z $: sag of surface parallel to the optical axis$ s $: radial distance from the optical axis$ C $: curvature, inverse of radius$ k $: conic constant$A_4, \\, A_6, \\, A_8, \\, ...$: 4th, 6th, 8th\u2026 order aspheric coefficients When the aspheric coefficients are equal to zero, the resulting aspheric surface is considered to be a conic. The following table shows how the actual conic surface generated depends on the magnitude and sign of the conic constant, $ \\small{k} $. Aspheric surfaces can also be specified using the orthogonal coefficients Qbfs and Qcon. Aspheres described using these coefficients are called Q-type aspheres. The Qbfs coefficient describes the RMS slope departure of the aspheric surface from a best-fit sphere. This departure can be easily calculated and provides a useful quantification of how easy it will be to test the surface. The Qcon coefficient describes the sag departure of the aspheric surface from a base conic. These Q-type aspheres described by Qcon and Qbfs give designers more control over the optimization of the aspheres. They also reduce the number of terms needed for manufacturing, thereby avoiding unnecessary complications for fabrication, simplifying testing, and reducing cost. The most unique geometric feature of aspheric lenses is that the radius of curvature changes with distance from the optical axis, unlike a sphere, which has a constant radius (see Figure 3). This distinctive shape allows aspheric lenses to deliver improved optical performance compared to standard spherical surfaces. Precision glass molding is a manufacturing technique where optical glass cores are heated to high temperatures until the surface becomes malleable enough to be pressed into an aspheric mold (see Figure 4). After the cores cool down to room temperature, the resulting lenses maintain the shape of the mold. Creating the mold has high initial startup costs because the mold must be precisely made from very durable material that can maintain a smooth surface, while the mold geometry needs to take into account any shrinkage of the glass in order to yield the desired aspheric shape. However, once the mold is finished the incremental cost for each lens is lower than that of standard manufacturing techniques for aspheres, making this technique a great option for high volume production. For decades, machined aspheric lenses have been ground and polished one lens at a time. Although this process of individually producing machined aspheres hasn\u2019t changed dramatically, significant fabrication technology advancements in precision polishing have elevated the achievable level of accuracy possible from this production technique. In precision polishing, small contact areas on the order of square millimeters are used to grind and polish aspheric shapes. These small contact areas are adjusted in space to form the aspheric profile during computer-controlled precision polishing, as shown in Figure 5. If even higher quality polishing is required, magneto-rheological finishing (MRF) is used to perfect the surface using a similar small area tool that can rapidly adjust the removal rates to correct errors in the profile (see Figure 6). MRF technology provides high-performance finishing in less time than standard polishing techniques because of its precise control of the removal location and high removal rate. While other manufacturing techniques generally require a special mold unique to each lens, precision polishing utilizes standard tooling, making it the best option for prototyping and low-to-medium volume production. Similar to grinding and polishing, single-point diamond turning (SPDT) can be used to manufacture single lenses one at a time. However, the tool size used in SPDT is significantly smaller than in precision polishing, producing surfaces with improved surface finishes and form accuracies. Material options are also much more limited with SPDT than with other techniques because glass cannot be shaped through diamond turning, whereas plastics, metal, and crystals can. SPDT can also be used in making metal molds utilized in glass and polymer molding. Polymer molding begins with a standard spherical surface, such as an achromatic lens, which is then pressed onto a thin layer of photopolymer in an aspheric mold to give the net result of an aspheric surface (see Figure 7). This technique is useful for high volume precision applications where additional performance is required and the quantity can justify the initial tooling costs. Polymer molding uses an aspheric mold created by SPDT and a glass spherical lens. The surface of the lens and the injected polymer are compressed and UV cured at room temperature to yield an aspherized lens. Since the molding happens at room temperature instead of at a high temperature, there is far less stress induced in the mold, reducing tooling costs and making the mold material easier to manufacture. The thickness of the polymer layer is limited and constrains how much aspheric departure can exist in the resulting asphere. The polymer is also not as durable as glass, making this is an unideal solution for surfaces that will be exposed to harsh environments. Injection molding allows for the optimization of part cost, the complexity of tooling, and precision. Plastic injection molding involves injecting molten plastic into an aspheric mold. Since plastic is not as thermally stable and resistant to pressure as glass, it must be specially treated in order to create a usable aspheric lens. Plastic lenses also have a lower scratch resistance than glass lenses. However, plastic lenses are advantageous because they are lightweight, easily molded, and integrate with mounting features to create a single element. While the selection of optical quality plastic is limited, the cost and weight benefits will drive some designs toward plastic aspheric lenses. Plastic aspheres can also be formed using compression molding, where a preheated plastic material is placed in the open lower half of a mold before the top half of the mold is pressed down - compressing the plastic to match the mold shape. Compression molding is used for lenses where structure detail is important, such as in Fresnel lenses and lenticular arrays. Injection and compression molding techniques can be used separately or combined. When combined, the technique is commonly referred to as coining. Since all applications do not require identical lens performance, selecting the appropriate aspheric lenses is an important decision. Key factors to consider include your project timeline, overall performance requirements, budgetary constraints, and anticipated volumes. Many applications may be satisfied with an off-the-shelf aspheric lens, taking advantage of the immediate availability and straightforward order fulfillment. Often, these standard aspheric lenses can also be quickly and easily modified with anti-reflection coatings or dimensional reduction to address requirements that are reasonably close to the standard offering. If your application requires you to reduce the amount of aberrations present in a standard spherical lens, Edmund Optics\u00ae can also modify one of our standard spherical PCX lenses into an aspheric lens. By introducing a negative conic constant and removing about 400 microns of material, you will end up with an asphere that significantly outperforms the original spherical lens. If off-the-shelf products are not sufficient, consider custom aspheric manufacturing for prototyping, pre-production, or large volume applications. * 1/10th wave at 632.8nm, limited by design and/or metrology Surface accuracy is a measure of how accurately the optical surface matches its designed shape. There are a variety of ways of defining surface accuracy and the errors to the surface shape. They are grouped into three categories based on their frequency across the surface of a part: form errors, waviness, and surface roughness. Form error, or irregularity, is typically the most important and commonly specified surface specification for aspheres. This specification consists of low frequency or larger errors usually peaking one to three times across a part. Form errors are typically specified as peak-to-valley error in waves or fringes, but can also be specified as a linear deviation in microns or as an RMS deviation. Waviness, or mid-spatial frequency error, describes ripple-like errors happening in a frequency of 5-100 instances across the part and is most often introduced when a surface is polished with small polishing tools. This rarely happens in whole-aperture polishing performed when making spherical optics. Because of this, waviness is typically ignored in spherical lenses but may need to be specified in aspheres. Waviness is most commonly defined as a slope error over a specific scan length. Waviness sensitivity is application-specific and many lenses are not sensitive to it, therefore it is important to only specify a waviness tolerance if the tolerance will affect your application. When adding additional lens requirements, costs can increase due to added testing. Surface roughness, or high-frequency error, is a measure of smoothness, or the quality of the polish on an optic\u2019s surface. Surface roughness can affect scatter and the ability to withstand high laser power on the surface. To define surface roughness, it is important to describe both the amplitude and the frequency range of interest as the choice of test equipment may filter out high frequencies. Analyzing surface roughness requires very special testing and can be time-consuming; therefore it is best to only specify surface roughness when necessary. Radius error, a specific subset of form errors, is a constant change in radius across the lens. It is the most common and also generally the easiest error for a system to tolerate since it is typically corrected by adjusting the focus position. Radius error can be defined as a percentage change in radius from the design radius (or vertex radius), a linear change in radius, or as fringes of power. Manufacturing costs for a lens can be reduced by allowing a looser radius tolerance. Proper metrology is necessary to ensure an asphere meets all required tolerances. The two most common measurement techniques for surface accuracy or figure error are interferometry and profilometry. Interferometry measures the difference between a reference wavefront and the wavefront reflected off a surface or transmitted through an optic. Testing an aspheric wavefront is much more difficult than testing spherical wavefront due to the difficulty of generating an aspheric reference wavefront compared to the common practice of generating a spherical wavefront. It is possible to test an asphere using a spherical reference wavefront if the asphere has deviations from a sphere smaller than the dynamic range of the interferometer, but this is seldom the case for aspheres. Null interferometry is a branch of interferometry that is either done by using null lenses or computer-generated holograms. A null lens is a spherical lens, or an assembly of spherical lenses, designed to have an amount of spherical aberration equal to the departure from a sphere of the nominal aspheric surface. The amount of interference observed shows the deviation between the real aspheric surface and the nominal surface. Computer-generated holograms (CGH) use holography to generate the desired wavefront when a special plate is placed in the reference path of the interferometer. Null interferometry is expensive and time-consuming to set up because it must be carefully calibrated for the shape of the specific aspheric surface being tested, but afterward it can be used to quickly and accurately test many identical aspheric surfaces. Stitching interferometry is a branch of interferometry in which a small section of the aspheric surface is tested with a spherical wavefront. If the deviation from a sphere is smaller than the dynamic range of the interferometer over a small area, a measurement can be made using a spherical wavefront over that region. Measurements from many small sections are stitched together to give a complete map of the surface. There are several methods of stitching and each varies by the sections they divide a surface into. All stitching methods have limitations on the shapes they can test and are restricted to surfaces without inflection points where the local radius of curvature goes from a positive to a negative radius. Stitching interferometry has a faster set up time than null interferometry, but the test time per part is more than that of null interferometry because multiple sections of the lens must be tested. Profilometry measures the change in height of a lens by moving a probe across the surface. This is usually done in spirals or slices across the surface, building a cross section or a surface map of the height. Slices are normally quicker to measure but do not provide full surface information. Profilometry is more simple and flexible than interferometry, but is not as accurate. The limitations on shapes a profilometer can test is typically only limited by the slope of the part, while features such as inflection points do not limit the profilometer. Set up time is typically short for a profilometer, but scan time can vary depending on the number of scans or area scanned.

Many did not know that Biden's middle name was Robinette. The unusual name began trending on Twitter, as social media users asked how he came by the original moniker. Biden is named after his father, Joseph Robinette Biden Sr, who was in turn named after his mother, Mary Elizabeth Robinette. Joe Biden was sworn in on Wednesday with his full name - Joseph Robinette Biden Jr The name Robinette comes from his paternal grandmother: it was Mary Biden's maiden name Biden himself believes that it is of French origin, although he is not sure. 'It's my grandmother Biden's maiden name,' he once said.\u00a0 'It's French. And it goes back a long, long way. Allegedly the Robinettes came over with Lafayette and never went home. I don't know that. We can't guarantee that.'\u00a0 Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, arrived in the United States in 1777 and fought in the American Revolutionary War, spending many years in the country and making frequent trips between France and the young republic. His last visit was 1824-25.\u00a0\u00a0 At the time, middle names were not common in the United States. 'If you look back, the founding fathers didn't have middle names,' Laura Wattenberg, author of The Baby Name Wizard, told The Daily Beast.\u00a0 'The idea that we just choose a middle name is pretty recent.' The concept emerged around the 19th century as a way to highlight advantageous family connections.\u00a0 It is today a relatively uncommon last name: there are only 10,800 people with the last name Robinette, according to HowManyOfMe.com. Biden is even less common: only around 170 people have that last name. As a first name, it is even less common - only 1,800 people have the name Robinette.\u00a0 Mary Elizabeth Robinette was born in 1894 in Maryland. When Mary married Joseph Harry Biden she took his last name. Her husband, Joseph, was in the oil business, starting off delivering kerosene and later becoming a salesman at the same company. Their son, Joseph Robinette Biden, was born in 1915 and went on to marry Catherine Eugenia 'Jean' Finnegan, who was born in 1917 in Scranton, Pennsylvania to Irish immigrant parents. Joe Biden is pictured with his father Joseph Robinette Biden Sr, who died in 2002 aged 86 Jean was a 'spunky Irish lass with a mind of her own,' according to Joe Biden: A Life of Trial and Redemption by Jules Witcover. Jean and Joseph were married in 1941. A year later, on November 20, 1942, the first of their four children was born \u2013 Joseph Robinette Biden Jr (who they nicknamed 'Joey'). His paternal grandmother, who provided the unusual middle name for her son and grandson, died aged 48 when the president was only one. She is buried in Newtonville, Massachusetts. Joseph Robinette Biden Sr died in 2002 at age 86. Mary Elizabeth Robinette became Mary Biden, and is buried in Newtonville, Massachusetts The president's middle name sparked amusement on Twitter. Kevin Klancy, a radio host and blogger who writes as @KFCBarstool, remarked: 'We elected a dude with the middle name 'Robinette' ???' Another person tweeted a photo of Barack Obama and Joe Biden running through the White House, with the caption: 'Batman and Robinette'. 'Huge day for Robinette visibility,' tweeted one Twitter user, Ashley Feinberg. 'Shout out to all the Robinettes out there who've been living in the shadows. Your time has come, solidarity with the Robinettes.' Author Mary Robinette Kowal replied: 'Why thank you!' Biden is certainly not the first president to have a notable middle name. Obama's middle name - Hussein - was seized on by his opponents as 'evidence' of what they spun as a dangerously international, anti-American leaning. President Warren Harding's middle name was Gamaliel. Harry Truman's middle name was simply the letter S, and Theodore Roosevelt did not have a middle name at all.

Aspheric means \u201cnon-spherical,\u201d so there is less of a bulge or curve. Conventional lenses have a spherical curvature on the front of the lens (like a basketball). On the other hand, aspheric lenses are smoother and flatter, reducing distortion when wearing glasses. Because of their spherical curvature, conventional lenses tend to be thicker than aspheric lenses. This makes them thicker and heavier, especially when you have a strong prescription.\u00a0 Aspheric lenses are smoother and flatter, reducing the distortion that occurs when someone wears glasses. For many people, this improvement means feeling better in their glasses. They may be more willing to wear their corrective lenses. In the past, the only options someone would have if they did not like how they looked in conventional lenses were: This is no longer the case with aspheric lenses. You can now choose from\u00a0 various styles and shapes of eyeglasses without sacrificing appearance and comfort. Conventional lenses are prone to spherical errors (aberrations) that create blurry images. Even slight blurring makes wearing glasses uncomfortable. Aspheric lenses do not have this problem. With conventional lenses, it\u2019s easy to find affordable frames that match your prescription. Aspherical lenses require more precision to make and take longer to produce. As such, they're more expensive due to manufacturing costs.\u00a0 Yes, progressive lenses are aspherical in design. The curvature of these lenses gradually changes from the top to the bottom. Aspherical lenses are expensive due to manufacturing costs. They require more precision to make and take longer to produce. People with higher order refractive errors, typically +4.00 diopters or more, are ideal candidates for aspheric lenses.

Additional information may be obtained from departmental advisers and from the College Advising Center, 726 Broadway, 7th floor; 212-998-8130. A Dean's Honors List is compiled at the end of each academic year, in June. This is an honor roll of matriculated students who have achieved an average of 3.65 or higher for that academic year (September to May) in at least 28 graded points. To be listed, a student must not have any grades of Incomplete or N at the time the list is compiled. Note that grade point averages are carried to three decimal places (but are not rounded off). Any student seeking to join a departmental scholastic honorary society is required to maintain, as a minimum scholastic requirement for election to membership, a general average of 3.50, as well as an average in the major subject of 3.50. Students should consult with departmental advisers in regard to the specific requirements for the various departmental honor societies. Phi Beta Kappa celebrates and advocates excellence in the liberal arts and sciences, and the Phi Beta Kappa Society invites for induction the most outstanding arts and science students in America's leading colleges and universities. NYU's College of Arts and Science chapter, the Beta of New York, was established in 1858. In terms of seniority, it ranks as the 15th oldest chapter of the society. Each April, the faculty members of the Beta chapter automatically review the academic performance of all students in the College for eligibility for election to Phi Beta Kappa. To be graduated with honors, a student must have at least 64 points earned in courses from CAS, GSAS, and selected Tisch departments. All graded courses taken while enrolled either in the College or in another school of NYU will be used in computing the grade point average on which Latin honors are based, as long as the 64-point residency requirement is met. Pass (P) grades are not counted; grades received in courses taken at other institutions are also not counted. The student must also have a clean record of conduct. Effective with the September 2008 graduating class, the GPA cutoffs for each category are determined by the combined GPA distribution from the preceding academic year, all graduation moments included. The cutoff for summa cum laude is the GPA included within the top 5 percent of the previous year's graduating class. The cutoff for magna cum laude is the GPA included within the next 10 percent of the previous year's class. The cutoff for cum laude is the GPA included within the next 15 percent of the previous year's class. For example, the necessary GPA level for summa cum laude for students graduating in September 2008 will be based on the GPA cutoff for the top 5 percent of the combined graduates from September 2007, January 2008, and May 2008. More information and current GPA cutoffs can be found on the Registrar's graduation honors page. Students who have completed at least 64 points of graded work in the College may be awarded degrees with departmental honors if they complete the designated honors sequence in a department and maintain the requisite grade point averages. There are two levels: honors and high honors. Faculty in the departments (not the College) choose how they define and award honors and high honors, but in general, the latter is awarded to students who have done exceptional work on their research and capstone projects. Students seeking admission to and graduation with departmental honors are expected to have a minimum grade point average of 3.65, both overall and in the major. Departments may exercise some flexibility: in rare cases where a candidate for admission to a departmental honors program falls short of the expected minimum GPA, the director of undergraduate studies or the director of departmental honors may petition the director of college honors for an exception. In all cases, once admitted, students are expected to maintain the GPA at the stipulated level in order to graduate with departmental honors. Should there be an exceptional circumstance in which the stipulated GPA is not maintained, the director of college honors may be petitioned for an exception. If the case is compelling, the latter will inform the registrar's office of the waiver. Honors programs must, minimally, be a two-term (8-point) experience that includes a capstone research project. The capstone project, which typically culminates in a thesis, should reflect sustained original research over two semesters. The scope and length of a thesis will vary by discipline, but the thesis is typically 40 to 60 pages in length. All students completing departmental honors must make public presentations of their work, preferably at the CAS Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) held at the end of the academic year, or in a departmental forum (e.g., oral defenses or presentations) held in conjunction with the URC. Students with double majors in discrete, unrelated disciplines must complete honors programs in each major for which they seek honors. Students with double majors in interdisciplinary or related fields may, if the two departments concur, convene a joint honors committee to establish an interdisciplinary research program of course work that culminates in a single thesis. Similarly, in the case of joint majors, the relevant departments must work out an agreement on the requirements for honors and on the supervision and evaluation of students' theses or projects. Membership in the Presidential Honors Scholars at the College of Arts and Science offers outstanding students the opportunity to receive special advising from College faculty and staff, to challenge themselves in honors courses and through independent research, to study away, to take advantage of New York City's cultural resources, and to develop leadership skills through community service. Scholars comprise a distinguished group of undergraduates; only the top 10 percent of the entering class are chosen, and students who apply for entry after they have matriculated must demonstrate not only superlative academic achievements but also a consistent record of leadership and service to the community. First-year students appointed on the basis of their high school records participate in a Scholars Seminar. They meet regularly for lectures and discussions and participate in a wide variety of cocurricular activities. These include the Scholars Lecture Series, cultural events in the city, social events, and community service projects. During the January intersession, first-year scholars travel with faculty mentors to NYU Florence, Italy. Sophomore scholars also participate in a trip abroad, choosing a destination that most closely relates to their academic or personal interests. During their junior or senior year, scholars spend an entire semester (or year) studying at one of NYU's programs or exchanges away. In their junior and senior years, they also enroll in the honors track of their chosen major. In addition, Presidential Honors Scholars are committed to volunteering and serving in the community. Membership in the scholars program is renewable annually, depending on the quality of the scholar's academic records and his or her level of participation in the program. All scholars are expected to be full-time students and maintain a grade point average of at least 3.65. Students who are not designated as Presidential Honors Scholars for the first-year students are invited to apply for membership at the end of the spring semester. Further information is available from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, 726 Broadway, 7th floor (212-998-8140) or from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 383 Lafayette Street, 2nd Floor (212-998-4550). Since its inception in 1987, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Scholars Program has awarded over 400 need-based and merit scholarships to incoming freshmen at NYU. These students present records of outstanding academic achievement, leadership, and commitment to the principles of community service, humanitarianism, and social progress. MLK Scholars help to plan and participate in academic and cultural events that draw on the vast resources of New York University and New York City. They explore cultural diversity through domestic and international travel and take the lead in helping others through community service. Rudin Scholars are outstanding entering freshmen selected from public and parochial high schools in all five boroughs of New York City. In addition to their scholarship, the scholars participate in academic and cultural activities in New York City. The program is named in honor of the late real estate developer Lewis Rudin, former president of the Association for a Better New York and an NYU alumnus and trustee. To recognize the outstanding academic achievements of its students, the College and its departments award numerous awards and prizes to a select number\u00a0of students who have demonstrated excellence in their field of study. These awards and prizes have been made possible through the generous donations and contributions of friends and alumni of the College.

Premium quality and repeatability are cornerstones of the products we develop for you \u2013 from individual aspherics to mounted optics and complex systems. The use of aspherics in an optical system achieves several advantages. In the following comparison the aspheric lens is compared to the classical sphere. Advantages of aspheric optics are: Using spherical lenses, imaging errors, so-called spherical aberrations, inevitably occur (see figure on the left). This results in a slightly blurred, out-of-focus image because the light rays do not converge on the optical axis at one focal point. The rays are refracted to different degrees depending on their distance from the optical axis: those that pass through the edges of the lens are refracted more strongly. Aspheric optics are rotationally symmetric, with one or more non-spherical surfaces that deviate from the shape of a sphere. The surfaces change their radius of curvature with increasing distance from the optical axis. These properties allow the light rays to converge in one point and the spherical aberration to be corrected. Thanks to modern production technologies, asphericon is able to manufacture aspheric lenses with highest precision even in series. Regarding optical design, the use of an aspherics allows the optical system to be reduced in size. An application that requires several spherical lenses can sometimes be replaced by one aspheric lens. This is made possible by the high correction value of aberrations. By eliminating single optics, the entire system becomes more compact and the overall weight can be reduced. An illustrative example of the reduction of an optical system can be found in beam expansion. The monolithic beam expander a|BeamExpander, consists of only one single aspheric lens per element. Due to the afocal character, the individual monoliths can also be connected in series. This allows a high variance in the range of beam expansion. Compared to conventional systems, such as the Kepler and Galilean telescopes, the overall length is reduced by up to 50% while maintaining the same magnification and quality. For the specific application, the three optical systems mentioned above are shown below with a 10x magnification. The result: With the aspheric system the overall size is reduced by up to 50%. In addition, the system works completely diffraction limited, even when combining up to 5 a|BeamExpanders. Due to the different shape to the sphere, a more complex description of the rotationally symmetric aspheric lens is required. Traditionally, aspheric lens surface profiles can be described with the following formula. \u00a0 \\( z(h) = \\frac {h^2}{R(1+\\sqrt{1-(1+k) \\frac{h^2}{R^2})}} + \\sum_{i=2}^{n} A_{2i} h^{2i}\\) z = Sag of surface h = Distance perpendicular to the optical axis (height of incidence) R = Radius k = Conic constant A2i = aspheric coefficients of the correction polynomial If the respective aspheric coefficient of a rotationally symmetric asphere is zero, the resulting surface profile is considered conical. Depending on the conic constant k, one of the following conic sections serves as a surface shape description: \u00a0 \u00a0 With ISO 10110, which was renewed in 2015, there is an alternative to the traditional description of aspheric surfaces. Based on orthonormal polynomials, it can be used to model the real difference in deflection to the best-fitted spherical shape of the aspherical lens. The new formula also includes the surface quotient Qm and reads: \\( z(h) = \\frac {h^2}{R[1+\\sqrt{1- \\frac{h^2}{R^2}]}} + (\\frac{h}{h_0})^2 \\frac {[1- (\\frac{h}{h_0})^2]}{\\sqrt{1-(\\frac{h}{R})^2}} \\sum_{m=0}^{N} A_m*Q_m (\\frac{h^2}{h_0^2})\\) The revised formula offers far-reaching advantages that simplify the surface description. One major advantage is that fewer significant digits are required to describe the surface profile. A further advantage is the maximum sag departure deflection deviation. This can be estimated by multiplying the largest coefficient Am by the maximum amplitude for the order of this coefficient. The three most reported surface shape imperfections are: They represent deviations of the real surface from the ideal surface, as for the aspheric lens. The parameters used to describe the surface profile allow a prediction of the quality of a manufactured lens profile after processing. A high surface quality can among other things be achieved by a high process stability.  Figure 3: Comparison of the three most frequent surface form imperfections (form error, waviness, and surface roughness) according to shape and type of deviation \u00a0 The form error describes the difference between the lowest and highest point of the test surface. Metaphorically speaking, it refers from mountain to valley, therefore the form error is given by the PV value, peak-to-valley. The PV value is one of the most important surface specifications for inspecting the surface of an aspheric lens. It is evaluated in waves or in fringes. It is also possible to specify it as an RMS or micrometer deviation. The RMS value (Root Mean Square) describes the mean square difference between the ACTUAL and the TARGET surface, taking into account the area of the defect. Waviness errors on an aspheric lens can be caused, for example, by polishing tools during the machining process. This surface deviation is therefore application specific. The waviness has a longer wavelength than the roughness, which is why the short wavelengths are filtered out for their examination. Only low frequencies may pass. It is often also referred to as the inclination error, which is examined over a defined length. A specification of waviness tolerances is only necessary if the waviness has an effect on the optical task of the aspheric lens. \u00a0 Surface roughness describes smallest irregularities on the optical surface. Therefore, only the short wavelengths are examined for analysis and low frequencies are filtered out. Surface roughness is a dimension for the quality of polishing processes. The effect on optical applications of the aspheric lens can often be decisive. For example, a high degree of roughness can lead to a faster wear of the aspherical lens as soon as high powers, such as those of a laser, act on it. In addition, scattering reduces the quality of the measurement results, which is why low surface roughness is considered a high-quality feature. In industries such as metrology or aerospace this is of importance. The determination of surface roughness is part of the manufacturing process, especially for high-quality aspheric lenses. asphericon has specialized in the production of aspheric lenses by grinding, polishing, diamond turning and high-end finishing. In this process a blank is subjected to various work steps: Blanks are already shaped lenses and the starting material for the further process to produce an aspheric lens. In the first work step, the blank is ground to give it its desired shape. Various grinding tools and technologies are used for this complex process. The ability to simulate the individual process steps using asphericon's unique CNC control software allows for an unprecedented realization, for high flexibility and reliability during the entire process. In the following, the polishing process is an important part in the production of an aspheric lens. Step by step, the surface is reworked to achieve the desired requirements (e.g. the surface shape deviation). Polishing can be done by machining with geometrically undefined, very fine grain, but also by chemical removal. A finished polished lens has a bright surface without pores and depth cracks as well as the desired shape accuracy and surface quality. The diamond turning process is an alternative machining method for shaping an aspheric lens. A monocrystalline diamond is used to machine the lens surface. In contrast to grinding tools, this is much smaller and more filigree. Due to its high hardness, ultra-precise machining of the lens is possible, resulting in an improved surface quality. By means of diamond turning, non-ferrous metals, nickel-phosphorus layers, crystals, and IR-glasses can be machined, in addition to an aspheric lens made of plastic. The subsequent measurement of an aspheric lens is used to check the shape and surface to detect and correct any deviations. An aspheric lens can be measured tactile and optical or contactless, depending on the processing state and accuracy. The full-surface precise measurement of aspheric lenses and other optics at asphericon includes: \u00a0 With tactile measuring methods, the surface of an optical component is scanned with a probe. Differences in height between the scanned surface section and the nominal surface of the measured object are determined. The determined data of the height differences are then analysed and evaluated by a software. A rigid touch probe system and a contact pressure of the probe ball that is as constant as possible are required for the exact determination of the surface contour. Among more complex tactile measuring devices are the 3D coordinate measuring system and the form tester Mahr MFU, both used at asphericon. Much more common are interferometric measuring methods for testing an aspheric surface. Interferometers are based on the principle of interference, i.e. the superposition of two coherent light waves (the test beam and the reference beam). A characteristic interference fringe pattern is produced which is used to evaluate the optical surface. The interference fringes are differences in intensity caused by a phase shift of the test wave to the reference wave. This means that surface deviations of the aspheric lens from the ideal shape become visible. To measure an aspheric lens, a computer-generated hologram (CGH) is sometimes additionally required to generate the aspheric reference wavefront. Such a measurement is repeated in phase-shifting measurement methods with several shifts of the reference surface, resulting in a full-surface error map of the aspheric lens to be measured. The MarOpto TWI 60 measuring system, which has been used by asphericon since 2017, is considered a pioneer in optical metrology and measures without CGHs. The modern interferometer measures using differently tilted wave fronts and thus inspects aspheric lenses and freeforms in seconds. The last processing step within the production of an aspheric lens is the high-end finishing. This serves as the final correction step for even more precise surface processing. The ION-Finish\u2122 technology developed by asphericon (= punctual processing of optical surfaces using a focused ion beam) and the magnetorheological finishing technology (MRF for short, as a mechanical polishing process using magnetorheological fluid consisting of magnetic particles, polishing agent and water) enable accuracies of \u03bb/600 RMS on flat surfaces - even in series production. In addition, asphericon offers the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m polishing, a process for aspheric surfaces with roughness values of 5 \u00c5 (Rq according to ISO 10110). Based on CNC manufacturing, this finishing is fully automatically controlled and is especially recommended for processing optics used in applications with high laser power. The use of an aspheric lens is mainly based on its advantages compared to a spherical lens. The biggest benefit is the correction of aberrations resulting in better imaging properties. Telescopes today, for example, are almost always aspherical, especially those with larger diameters. Aspheric elements are also used in zoom lenses. Not only the system size is reduced but also the imaging quality is increased compared to applications with spherical lenses. For star observation, but also in the aerospace industry, aspheric lenses can be used. The Sentinel-4 satellite, for example, contains aspheric optics from asphericon in its spectrometers. For use in space, the optics do not only need excellent optical properties, but also have to withstand extreme environmental conditions. Here you can learn more about Sentinel-4. Another field of application is laser beam shaping, such as the generation of Top-Hat beam profiles. In a beam shaping system with two aspheric lenses for Top-Hat light distribution the first lens is used to redistribute the incoming laser beams (Gaussian distribution) in such a way that a homogeneous intensity distribution is achieved at a certain distance. The second lens collimates the beam and as a result, the characteristic Top-Hat distribution is created. These aspheric applications are of interest in material processing (e.g. cutting of metal) and also in medical applications (e.g. ophthalmology). A detailed description of laser beam shaping with aspheric lenses and other application examples can be found in our blog. Imaging ophthalmological-instrumental procedures also work with aspheric lenses. Installed in special instruments, they support preventive and postoperative examinations, treatments, and diagnoses of the eye, such as ocular fundus examinations using a slit lamp or fundus camera. In addition to high-resolution imaging, aspheric lenses guarantee a more compact design of ophthalmological observation systems as well as very good imaging qualities. In industrial areas such as manufacturing, quality control or robotics, high-quality camera systems are required. These are equipped with lenses, which can be based on aspheric lenses. Even under the most difficult conditions, such as high temperatures under constant use, the lenses must withstand. Their task is to focus the light scattered by the object onto a light-sensitive sensor. By passing through several different process steps, important data is transported to its destination. A relatively new application for aspheric lenses on the market is the field of metrology. Their use can significantly reduce the total number of lenses used in a Fizeau transmission sphere and increases the measuring range. Another advantage: the transmission sphere is also significantly lighter thanks to the use of fewer lenses.

Mary Gay Scanlon and the \u201cOne Tree Hill\u201d actor Sophia Bush at Bryn Mawr College in the Philadelphia suburbs. They were discussing reproductive rights, one of dozens of similar events Harris has held in the weeks leading up to the November 8 midterms.  She was fired up \u2014 especially about politicians pushing abortion bans without exceptions.  \u201cThese extremist so-called leaders would dare to say and suggest that that individual, furthermore, will not have the right to make decisions about what comes next as it relates to their body,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThis is immoral. It's unconscionable.\u201d  Nearly two years into her vice presidency, Harris has eagerly embraced a role as the face of the Biden administration\u2019s efforts on abortion access and reproductive health. She sprang into immediate action as the point person on the issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer and has gone all-in, with dozens of official events and campaign stops focused on abortion ever since.  Harris and President Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings remain underwater with Americans overall, and Harris hasn\u2019t appeared alongside many of the candidates running in the most competitive races of the 2022 midterms. Her role, rather, has been to use the power of her office to support state lawmakers and abortion advocates on the ground, and to speak to the voters who are key to the Democratic base, advocates and officials say.   It began before Roe was overturned: After Texas passed a six-week abortion ban in September 2021, Harris convened what is believed to be the first-ever official event featuring abortion providers and patients hosted by any presidential administration. Since the draft of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturning Roe v. Wade leaked in early May, Harris has held over 35 official events focused on reproductive health access in 14 states and Washington, D.C., according to her office. \u201cShe's very well-versed in the topic, and it's something she feels very passionately about,\u201d said Brian Brokaw, a California-based political consultant who previously served as Harris\u2019 campaign manager during her run for attorney general. \u201cIn an election season where abortion rights are front and center, it\u2019s a particularly good issue for her.\u201d  Women of color have long played a leading role in reproductive justice movements. And the Supreme Court ending almost 50 years of federal abortion protections coincided with Harris serving as the highest-ranking woman and woman of color in American history.  \u201cWhen access to critical reproductive health care is banned, including abortion, Black and Indigenous women disproportionately shoulder most of the burden due to systemic racism. It\u2019s evident in the country\u2019s abysmal maternal mortality rate,\u201d said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, who participated in an October discussion on reproductive rights with Harris and Rep. Jahana Hayes in Connecticut. \u201cAnd, in a moment like this, the response must center the voices of the people impacted most.\u201d Harris\u2019 remarks at these events often follow a similar flow: She starts by talking about her mother, Shyamala, a cancer researcher whose two goals in life were to raise her daughters and cure breast cancer. Harris recalls how words like \u201cmammary glands\u201d and discussions of reproductive health care were common at the dinner table during her childhood. She also invokes her work prosecuting sex crimes and gender-based violence in California.  \u201cThis issue \u2014 it really does relate to a lot of work that I've done in the past,\u201d Harris said in Bryn Mawr. \u201cAnd I feel a great sense of commitment, as do we all, to stand up and speak out about it.\u201d Since May, Harris has convened doctors and abortion providers, attorneys general, civil rights and faith leaders, constitutional law experts, college presidents, and student activists at roundtables and meetings around the country. She\u2019s also met with dozens of state lawmakers representing 15 states, from deep-blue California and New Jersey to the swing states of Pennsylvania, Nevada and North Carolina and the traditionally Republican strongholds of Indiana, South Dakota and Utah, including one event specifically focused on Latina legislators.  \u201cAs a Black woman working in government or in elected life, she is someone that we all look to and someone that we're very proud of,\u201d said Virginia Del. Candi Mundon King, who attended Harris\u2019 July roundtable with Virginia lawmakers. \u201cBut to be in the room with her was just really a humbling experience. And she also made it clear that she was there to listen.\u201d  Democratic Rep. Angela Romero of Utah, a vocally pro-abortion rights lawmaker in a deep red and religiously conservative state, said it was \u201can honor and a privilege\u201d to both be in conversation with Harris and share her broader concerns about health care access.  \u201cShe was there as a mentor to us. She said she wanted to make sure that we had a place at the table just like she does, and so that was her commitment to us being in a mentoring role,\u201d said Romero, who is also the president-elect of the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators. \u201cThat was really significant to me.\u201d  In October, Harris held six official fireside-chat-style events focused on reproductive rights in six states, that featured a Democratic official or candidates; reproductive health advocates, including the presidents of Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America; and celebrities like Bush. Three days before the Pennsylvania event, the vice president was on stage in Albuquerque with New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham \u2014 who is up for reelection this year \u2014 and Dr. Eve Espey, an OBGYN. The week before, Harris was in the Twin Cities and Los Angeles for similar reproductive-rights-focused official events featuring Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Los Angeles mayoral candidate Karen Bass, both of whom are on the ballot in November.  \u201cThese events are being done in a really smart way, leveraging the muscle behind her name, her office and the White House, and pairing that with local elected officials who people know and are familiar with,\u201d McGill Johnson said. \u201cThe vice president brilliantly reinforces the fact that we need an all-of-government approach in response to this fundamental right being taken away \u2013 and this message should continue well after the election.\u201d Harris\u2019 visits to Florida and North Carolina did not include appearances with Democratic U.S. Senate candidates Val Demings and Cheri Beasley, who are running to be the first Black women in the Senate since Harris became vice president. Biden, however, headlined a recent rally supporting Demings and gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist.  The vice presidency is a loosely defined role that can be difficult to navigate. The first year of Harris\u2019 tenure was marked by numerous headlines detailing low morale and high staff turnover in her office. Harris has also reportedly struggled to make clear-cut, tangible progress on the major elements of her assigned policy portfolio, which includes Democrats\u2019 still-unsuccessful effort to pass a major voting rights bill through Congress, and U.S. relations in the politically tumultuous Northern Triangle region of Latin America.  Harris has become the administration\u2019s main voice on abortion, an issue that Biden, whose views on abortion have substantially evolved over his five decades in office and came under scrutiny in the 2020 primary, has historically been less eager to embrace.  \u201cWithout a doubt, she has had to take on some very challenging issues. As vice president, your job is to support the president and take on the tough challenges,\u201d Brokaw said. \u201cI think this too, falls into that category of difficult challenges, but it's one where the public sentiment is largely with her, and she is somebody who can be a very compelling messenger.\u201d  Leaning into abortion and reproductive rights has enabled Harris to champion an issue that mobilizes voters far more than voting or immigration policy. Abortion isn\u2019t the top voting issue for most Americans. Still, the overturning of Roe v. Wade is energizing Democrats \u2014 especially the women and women of color who make up the party's base \u2014 to turn out.  \u201cThe role that abortion plays for women, for women of color, is much broader,\u201d said Aimee Allison, founder and executive director of She The People, which supports women of color for office. \u201cIt's about Black maternal health and whether you can afford health care in the first place. It's about the cost of rent and food, the cost of child care, whether you're getting fair pay for your work. All those issues are tied up with abortion.\u201d  Harris and Biden are walking a difficult political tightrope of utilizing their platforms to boost Democrats' prospects in the midterms while not hurting down-ballot candidates in states where both leaders are unpopular. Nationally, Americans disapprove of Harris\u2019 job performance by 12 percentage points on net, 38 percent to 50 percent, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s polling average. The federal government also has limited tools at its disposal when it comes to bolstering abortion access. But the administration has taken various actions to shore up patient privacy, expand reproductive health grants under Title X, reinforce nondiscrimination protections, and defend the rights of patients to travel across state lines for abortion care. And instead of headlining lots of big political rallies, Biden and Harris have mostly held smaller events with candidates and lawmakers focused on specific topics. Harris, in particular, has been out on the road touting new programs funded by the Biden administration\u2019s economic agenda and its efforts on reproductive health.  \u201cI think the White House has been very strategic about how both the president and vice president are used,\u201d Brokaw said.  Reproductive rights and abortion aren\u2019t going away as campaign issues, especially for Democrats. Allison said the new era in politics \u201cis led first and foremost by women of color\u201d \u2014 and Harris is one of the figures pioneering if and how Democrats should connect reproductive rights to economic security and other essential freedoms.  Allison said that what Democratic leaders do in 2022 \u201cis also a lesson for going forward, because the battle for 2024 is being formed now.\u201d  Romero said she\u2019s \u201cnervous\u201d looking toward the midterms \u2014 and for the future of reproductive rights and health for her constituents and women of color. \u201cFor me as a woman of color, to be able to have a seat at the table with the vice president of the United States, who's also a woman of color, just shows me that we've come a long way,\u201d Romero said. \u201cBut we can't go back in time. We still need to keep on pushing forward.\u201d   \n\tBut one Republican lawmaker was mocked after delivering a stern warning, insisting with no basis that should Democrats choose to release Trump\u2019s taxes, that would open the floodgates, allowing the tax returns of ordinary citizens, or even the tax returns of Supreme Court justices to be made public.\n \n\t\u201cGoing forward, the majority chair of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee will have nearly unlimited power to target and make public the tax returns of private citizens. And not just private citizens. Political enemies, business and labor leaders, or even the returns of Supreme Court justices themselves,\u201d U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, said, falsely.\n               On Monday, the J6 committee referred the criminal former president to the Justice Department for criminal investigation. That\u2019s a BFD. The Congress has never done that, as it had never twice impeached a president. Perhaps Donald Trump will be the first former president indicted for \u201cthe crime against democracy,\u201d as Jamie Raskin put it.                                 This happens every two years when a Democratic President is in office. And finally the US news media seems to be getting a clue as to why. More about that in a moment. Notwithstanding Fox \u201cNews\u201d hysteria about a \u201ccaravan\u201d of immigrants heading for the border during Obama\u2019s last year as president, in the months leading up to the 2016 election, by that time, as Politico noted:                            Copyright \u00a9 2022 Raw Story Media, Inc.

Resources: Individuals who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or households including anyone who receives Family Independence Temporary Assistance Program (FITAP), Kinship Care Subsidy Program (KCSP), or Strategies to Empower People (STEP) Program benefits are exempt from the resource limit. Households not exempt from the resource limit may have up to $2750 in resources, such as a bank account, cash, certificate of deposit (CDs), stocks, and bonds. Non-exempt households that include at least one household member who is age 60 or older or includes a disabled member may have up to $4250 in resources. Households are not exempt from the resource limit if: The following individuals are not exempt from the resource limit: Income:\u00a0Households must meet income tests (unless any member is receiving FITAP, KCSP, STEP benefits, or all members are receiving SSI). Most households must meet both the gross and net income tests, but a household with a person who is 60 years old or older or a person who is receiving certain types of disability payments only has to meet the net income test. Gross income means a household's total, non-excluded income, before any deductions have been made. Net income means gross income minus allowable deductions. Households, except those noted, that have income over the amounts listed below cannot get SNAP benefits. Allotment Amounts: The amount of SNAP a household receives depends on the number of people in the SNAP household and the amount of their net income.

SNAP Historical Information This program was established by Congress in 1964 by PL 88-55 which was superseded by the Food Stamp Act of 1977 and subsequent amendments to the Act.\u00a0 It is administered at the federal level by the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Food and Nutrition Service and at the state level by the Department of Children & Family Services. Besides certification and issuance activities, the Food Security Act of 1985 mandated that employment and training services be provided for SNAP recipients who are mandatory work registrants.\u00a0 The employment and training activities, known as the Louisiana Job Employment Training (LaJET) Program, are accomplished through the cooperative efforts of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the DCFS parish offices, (in parishes where available) local governing authorities in the State and the Louisiana Workforce Commission. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, which was signed into law on August 22, 1996, implemented many changes in SNAP, including a limit on the number of months certain persons can receive SNAP benefits without working.

You May Like: Important Auto Mechanic Tools and Equipment List Blue Point is a lower-end tool brand of Snap-On. They are made with the Snap-On specifications but with different finishes. Though Snap-On owns Blue Point, manufacturers are contracted to make Blue Point tools.\u00a0 Blue Point tools do not have a Snap-On name on them. They are the second in quality from Snap-On. The tools are simple, sturdy, functional, and able to fulfill the basic functions with minimum error. Blue Point, on the other hand, does not have the same finish as Snap-On. It is a little bulky compared to them later. Most professionals prefer a slim tool, especially when they want to get into tight spots. If you do not have enough cash to buy Snap-On tools, then Blue Point tools are a good alternative.  Snap-On tools are manufactured and distributed by Snap-On. Blue Point tools, on the other hand, are made by other manufacturers but distributed by Snap-On. Their firm in the USA manufactures most of the Snap-On tools. Blue Point tools are made with the specifications given by Snap-On but by different manufacturers from different places in the world. Though Blue Point tools are under Snap-On, they are not branded as such. The quality of Snap-On tools cannot be compared with any other tool in the market. Though they own the Blue Point tools, their quality is not the same. Blue Point is made by different manufacturing plants, and their quality may differ from one SKU number to the other. You can, therefore, find that one Blue Point tool differs in quality from another one. Blue Point tools are, therefore, second in line with Snap-On tools when it comes to quality. The cost of Snap-On and Blue Point tools is another thing that makes them different. Snap-On has been the best in terms of quality and is higher in cost. Blue Point, on the other hand, is the cheaper brand of Snap-On. You May Like Blue Point and Snap-On tools are not the same in terms of quality. Snap-On tools are of higher quality, and of course, they are pricier. The best thing about Blue Point tools is that they are cheaper they come with a lifetime warranty unless it is specified by the Point of sale. Their quality cannot reach that of Snap-On, but they are the second-best tools in the market. Though Snap-On tools are costly, they are durable and can serve you for a lifetime. Both tools will serve you the purpose. Snap-On tools have an awesome look, and it also feels good to use them. They are made with high-quality materials and are designed with the job and user in mind. Professionals prefer a tool with a slim finish to help them get into tight spots. Between Blue Point and Snap-On, the latter has a slim finish and thus ideal for anyone who does not want a bulky tool. Choose the tools you desire, depending on your budget. You will, for sure, get great value for your money. However, if money is not a problem, then I would advise you to consider Snap-On.  Answer: Snap-On tools are all made in the United States. Blue Point was a tool company in 1925 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Initially, this company was providing chisels and punches. It later expanded to include pliers, wrenches, and others. It also becomes synonymous with high-quality hand tools. Snap-On later bought Blue Point in 1930. Blue Point is made to Snap-On specifications but by various manufacturers who are given a product to produce a specific tool. Snap-On just decided not to put their name on a product they did not manufacture, but Blue Point is their brand. Answer: Blue Point tools are sourced by Snap-On from different tool manufacturers. This means that to know where a blue point tool is made; then you will have to research it individually. Unlike Snap-On, which is made and sold by Snap-On, Blue Point tools are made by other companies but sold by Snap-On. They are the lower and the cheaper brand of Snap-On. While Snap-On is the signature brand, Blue Point is in the next stage when it comes to quality. You can see where a blue point product is made from by looking at the country of origin written under the product specifications. Answer: When Snap-On was developed, its aim was to manufacture ten sockets that would \u201csnap on to 5 interchangeable handles. The slogan of the company was \u201c5 do the work of 50\u201d. That is where the word Snap-On came from. They have aimed to provide innovation and performance to their customers. Answer: Some of the Snap-On tools are made in the USA. The hand tools are manufactured in their manufacturing plants located in Tennessee in Elizabethton ad Wisconsin in Milwaukee. Some of the tools manufactured in America are Sandblasters, Roll Cabs for storage, ratchets, screwdrivers, and wrenches. Air tools from Snap-On are currently being manufactured in North California at Murphy. The Snap-On cordless power drill kit, Impact Driver, safety gloves, welding machine, helmets, and variable speed polisher, and some air compressors are made in China.\u00a0 Gas torches are mainly made in Ireland. Answer: Snap-On was founded by Joseph Johnson and Bill Seidemann in 1920. Their tools are manufactured and distributed by Snap-On Company. Their global headquarters are located in Wisconsin at Kenosha. Since then, they have been able to employ more than 12,600 people. Snap-On tools are not sold in retail stores but by dealers. The company values the time for their customers; thus, they do not have to go shopping for tools. They, therefore, take the Snap-On tools to the customers\u2019 homes or places of work. \nConclusion\nFrom the article above, we can clearly see the difference between Snap-On vs. Blue Point tools.

They also allow the Canon to produce more compact lenses than was previously possible using only spherical lens elements. In the early days, all lenses were spherical \u2013 i.e. they had a perfectly curved surface. They are the easiest lens shape to make, but are not best suited to rendering a sharp image as they cannot make parallel rays of light converge at the same point. This causes a problem called spherical aberration.  Canon designers discovered that an aspherical (non-spherical) lens shape would eliminate these spherical aberrations, because by altering the curvature of the lens could be used to converge the light rays to a single point. A spherical lens (left) brings light rays passing through its edges to a different focus point than light passing through its centre. An aspherical (or non-spherical) lens (right) can be designed so that all the light rays converge on the same point.  However, knowing the theory is one thing \u2013 achieving it in practice is quite another. The degree of asphericity is so minor that special manufacturing processes were created to stay within the 0.1 micron* tolerance. Measuring the curvature requires even greater accuracy. It wasn\u2019t until 1971 that the first SLR camera lens with an aspherical lens element was produced. However, it wasn\u2019t perfect. In fact, it took another two years before manufacturing techniques reached the levels required to really achieve large gains in image sharpness. Aspheric lens elements manufactured today are so accurately ground and polished that if the degree of asphericity is even 0.02 micron* (2/100,000mm) away from ideal, the element is rejected.  * A micron is one-millionth of a metre (0.000001m) or one-thousandth of a millimetre (0.001mm).

Polishing is often done with a small but compliant polishing pad that conforms to the shape generated in the grinding stage. \n\nMagnetorheological finishing (MRF) is a special polishing process used in conjunction with CNC grinding and polishing to provide even more control over the surface. In MRF, a ribbon of fluid is used to polish the surface. The ribbon changes viscosity in response to a varying magnetic field, so the removal rate can be precisely adjusted as the part is being polished, allowing for corrections even within the rotation of the part to correct any nonrotationally symmetric error on it. The process uses a wheel to pass a very small portion of the ribbon across the surface at any given time, allowing for correction of small areas. \n\nDiamond turning is a similar small-tool option that uses a single-point tool to manufacture the surface. The tool is so minuscule that it removes material on the order of the surface roughness of the final surface specification; as such it does not require a separate polishing step. \n\nAll of these techniques are subtractive manufacturing methods, wherein material is removed to form the final surface. Alternatively, molding can be used to make surfaces without removing material. \n\nSome economies of scale are possible with subtractive manufacturing methods, but the efficiencies of these methods are ultimately limited by the time needed for each step in the process. Molding offers significantly lower per-piece process times and expenses. Initial costs are high because tooling is expensive, so in low volumes it\u2019s seldom economical; however, in mid to high volumes, the reduced per-piece costs outpace initial investment. \n\n \n\nThe two primary methods for molding optics are precision glass molding and plastic injection molding. In precision glass molding, glass is heated to its softening point and compressed between two molds with great force. In plastic injection molding, liquid plastic is forced into a mold and cooled to a solid. \n\nDesign features\n\nEach fabrication method has its own unique strengths and limitations. If a design is optimized for the strengths of one manufacturing method (and to avoid that method\u2019s limitations), it would likely be difficult to manufacture that design using another method. So, it is important to determine the best manufacturing method for a design prior to final optimization. \n\nMaterial selection\n\nCNC and MRF work well with optical glasses and crystalline materials; they do not, however, work on plastics. Diamond turning is suitable for crystals, plastics and many metals. Diamond turning works very well with materials used for IR optics, which are also less sensitive to the generally higher surface roughness inherent in diamond turning. \n\nYou may also like...Microlens Array Fabrication Method Reduces Device CostsFluorescent Sensors with Noncanonical Amino Acids Could Broaden Sensor Use in Biological StudiesTOPTICA Relocates North American HQ: Week in Brief: 09/16/2022On-Demand Optical Singularities Strengthen Range of ApplicationsPrecision glass molding is limited to glasses that have transition temperatures <500 \u00b0C and with sufficiently low coefficients of thermal expansion, resulting in a very limited selection of glasses. The choices have increased dramatically in the past decade but still represent only a fraction of all available optical glasses. The molding process takes glass from its softening temperature down to room temperature in a short amount of time, which anneals the glass and reduces its index. This drop means the finished optics will not have the same index as the catalog specification for the glass. When designing for precision glass molding, users need to account for this lower index in their models. \n\nAs the name suggests, plastic injection molding is limited to plastics, of which there are very few options. \n\nRadii of curvature\n\nUnlike spherical lenses, aspheric lenses do not have a single radius of curvature. The local radius of curvature varies from the center of the part to its edge. This leads to the possibility that the local radius of curvature can change its sign from convex to concave at different points on the surface, as illustrated in Figure 3. The point where this occurs is called an inflection point, and it can cause problems with tooling and measurements. Within Zemax software, the surface-curvature cross-section plot can be used to check the local radius of curvature on a surface. Examination of the plot reveals inflection points where the plot crosses the zero curvature, which can help predict tooling issues where the concave radii are too small. \u00a0\n\n\n\nFigure 3. (a) If the aspheric lens has no inflection point, the curvature is never equal to zero. (b) When an aspheric surface has an inflection point, the inflection occurs where the curvature equals zero \u2013 in this example, at the 9.3-mm aperture.  \nThe finite tool size in both CNC grinding and polishing and MRF polishing limits the concave radius of curvature that can be manufactured. The specific limitation varies depending on the tools, but it is typically between 10 and 20 mm for most machines. Inflection points are not necessarily a problem, but they can create a local curvature too small for the machine to handle. In addition, MRF requires detailed surface metrology prior to any finishing steps. The ideal metrology for this is stitching interferometry, which can\u2019t measure a surface with an inflection. Diamond-turning tools are significantly smaller, and the minimum concave radius is typically on the order of millimeters for most tools. \n\nBoth precision glass molding and plastic injection molding are less restrictive with regard to local radii and surface geometries. Both can even allow for mounting features and other complex shapes; however, sharp corners will decrease tool lifetime and introduce surface errors near those transitions. \n\n \nFigure 4. The manufacturing cell shown features state-of-the-art production and metrology equipment. External dimensions\n\nThe shape of the aspheric element as a whole \u2013 its diameter, edge thickness and relative thickness across the part \u2013 will affect its manufacturability in different ways for different manufacturing methods. \n\nThe edge thickness for a small-tool-polished part is important, not only for strength to avoid edge chipping, but also to provide enough material beyond the nominal edge so the part can be polished to a larger diameter without running out of material. For CNC grinding and polishing, as well as MRF polishing, the part needs to be polished to a larger diameter. This accounts for the tool size, so the polishing tool doesn\u2019t overhang from the surface during polishing (such an overhang can cause surface form errors). \n\n \nFigure 5. Testing and quality assurance on optics and optical assemblies can be customized to meet project requirements. \nTypically a part needs to be about 5 mm larger than the necessary clear aperture during polishing. If edge thickness does not allow for the part to be that large, expensive and time-consuming tooling is required to avoid surface-form errors. The larger diameter is later reduced to final diameter in a centering step after polishing. Diamond turning does not require the oversized part because the tool size is so much smaller. \n\nSpring factor \u2013 the ratio of the diameter of the element to its thickest point \u2013 also is a constraint in polishing. The larger this ratio, the more a part can flex when removed from the polishing fixture. CNC polishing is more affected by this than MRF. For CNC polishing, a spring factor of less than 8 is ideal if a tight surface figure is required, but that ratio can rise to 20 if looser surface figures are acceptable. \n\n \nThe molding process also constrains the largest thickness of the element because of limits on the cavity size for molding tooling, which can vary depending on the manufacturer. Furthermore, in precision glass molding, thickness affects heating and cooling times and will also drive the price of parts. \n\nThe ratio of maximum and minimum thickness of the part is also a restriction for molding. Both precision glass molding and injection molding require a ratio of 3 or less. Factors such as stress in the material, cooling rates and shrinkage result in the need to control thickness deviation across the element. \n\nDiameter is seldom a restriction for polishing and diamond turning, at least until sizes exceed 150 mm, at which point the choice in manufacturers may become limited. However molding is far more restrictive, with both precision glass molding and plastic injection molding limited to maximum component diameters around 30 mm. \n\n Design considerations\n\nA quick review of each aspheric manufacturing method makes it clear that no single technique can satisfy every possible need. Working with a manufacturing partner, optics designers can select the method that matches their primary requirements, then evaluate the design for minor changes that can drastically improve manufacturability of the part. In this way, designers can tune their material selection \u2013 general surface profile and mounting design, for example \u2013 to fit the fabrication method required to meet the part\u2019s diameter and thickness specifications.\nThis is only the beginning, however. Detailed design specifications can be tuned to ease both fabrication and metrology, thereby optimizing manufacturability. The second article on this topic will discuss those details. \n\nImages courtesy of Edmund Optics"], "https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/careerservices/cvguide/honors": [" List\u00a0honors or awards you received: \nHONORS AND AWARDS Award Name, Name of Agency or Organization \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0YEAR\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a0"], "https://www.foxnews.com/video/6317571308112": [" Log in to comment on videos and join in on the fun.

(Notably, all three reporters\u00a0are billed as straight-news journalists, as opposed to opinion hosts.) \u201cWe kind of forced\u00a0@kamalaharristo try on this awesome oversized rainbow sequin jacket,\u201d Reston wrote. \u201cShe snapped it up.\u201d CNN USES ILHAN OMAR'S ANTI-SEMITISM CONTROVERSY TO ATTACK TRUMP, GOP Huey-Burns tweeted video of Harris trying on a colorful jacket, which she noted was spotted by the CNN reporter. \u201cOh yeah that\u2019s it,\u201d a voice is heard saying as Harris checks out her threads amid chuckles. Reston tweeted a different video, quoting Harris that it is awkward to shop in front of the press. \"This is awkward to shop in front of 5,000 cameras,\" she quoted Harris say saying in the tweet. Reporters have historically interacted with candidates on the campaign trail, but picking out clothing pushes boundaries in the eyes of many critics. Reston\u2019s tweet was met with a plethora of negative feedback.

In this guide, we give you 70+ academic honors examples to give you an idea of what types of achievements colleges like to see most on applications.\u00a0In addition, we explain what counts as an academic honor or award, go over different impressive academic honors and awards examples you can get, and give you useful tips for effectively talking about awards on your application.  \u00a0 First things first, what counts as an academic honor or award? Generally speaking, an academic honor or award is any major achievement you\u2019ve made and been recognized for in some way.\u00a0The form of recognition can range from an actual object, such as a trophy or plaque, to prize money, a title, or verbal recognition. Typically, an academic honor will fall into one of the following categories: If you\u2019ve won any awards for specific activities such as a sport you play or a club you\u2019re part of, it\u2019s better to list these in the extracurricular activities section of your application instead of in a separate awards section. So what are some honors and awards to put on a college application? Up next, we'll take a look at more than 70 academic honors examples. \u00a0  \u00a0 Here, we give you a list of 70+ academic honors and awards examples you could include on your own college application, from prizes won in national and international contests to school-based distinctions and awards. All the academic honors examples below are grouped by category and listed alphabetically. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of all academic honors and awards you could possibly have, so if you have an achievement that doesn\u2019t exactly match one of the examples below, don\u2019t worry\u2014you can still put it on your college application! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 Of the dozens of academic honors examples above, which ones will look the most impressive on a college application?\u00a0Here, we explain the top four qualities a truly impressive academic honor will have.\u00a0 Note that an honor doesn\u2019t need to have all\u00a0these qualities, though if it does, then it is definitely an excellent one to put on your application! \u00a0 One quality you want to highlight on your application is the selectivity of the award or honor you\u2019ve won.\u00a0In other words, the academic award will be one that a lot of students try to win, making it difficult to achieve. For example, because national and international contests and competitions draw so many student competitors, winning an award like these would certainly impress the admissions committee. The more selective an academic honor or award is, the more impressive it\u2019ll look on your college application. Academic Honors Examples of Highly Selective Awards \u00a0 Admissions committees see a lot of honor roll and National Society honors on college applications (not that these are bad\u2014they\u2019re just fairly common). So if you've won a particularly unique or rare award, definitely include it on your application, as this will\u00a0help you stand out from the crowd. A unique award can be highly selective; it can also be one that is less well known or that highlights something creative, surprising, or impressive about you. For instance, maybe you won the Most Innovative Employee award at your part-time job after you pitched the idea to create and manage a social media page for the company. Academic Honors Examples of Unique Awards \u00a0 Another academic award or honor that's\u00a0great to include on your college application is one that\u2019s relevant to your academic interests and strengths.\u00a0These are typically subject- or field-specific awards, such as English or writing awards, math awards, etc. For example, if you\u2019re planning to major in engineering, you'd want to detail any awards you might have won in science, math, or engineering contests. Relevant awards indicate to the admissions committee not only that you\u2019re truly committed to the field you want to study, but also that you\u2019re one of the most promising students in your field. Academic Honors Examples of Relevant Awards \u00a0 An impressive academic honor or award will also emphasize your leadership potential.\u00a0These are typically\u00a0awards that involve group or collaborative work.\u00a0So if you ever led others to success\u2014as a captain or president, for instance\u2014this kind of honor would look great to potential colleges. Just make sure that you explain on your application what kind of role you had and how your leadership specifically led your team to success. Academic Honors Examples of Leadership/Group Awards \u00a0 Since you likely won\u2019t have a lot of room to write about academic honors and awards on your application, it's important that\u00a0you present your academic achievements in an effective, impressive way.\u00a0Here are some tips on how to talk about the awards you've won. \u00a0 Admissions officers don\u2019t usually spend a lot of time with each application they get, so you want to make sure that you\u2019re catching their eyes right away by starting with your most impressive honors and awards.\u00a0These will generally be awards that are highly competitive and required a lot of work and commitment on your end. \u00a0 A \"spike\" is a particular academic passion you have.\u00a0For example, if you\u2019re a science buff who plans to major in chemistry, you'd want to emphasize your spike on your application by focusing primarily on your chemistry- and science-related activities and awards. Having a spike will ultimately help you stand out from other applicants.\u00a0To learn more about how you can develop a spike, check out our guide on how to get into Harvard and the Ivy League. \u00a0 Spikes: good for hedgehogs and college applications. \u00a0 Not all academic awards and honors are well known or obvious, especially if they\u2019re unique to your school or area. Therefore, make sure that you\u2019re using the space you have in the awards section of your application to describe any academic honors that the admissions committee is probably unfamiliar with. The last thing you want an award to do is confuse admissions officers, so be clear about what it is, how you won it, and what makes it impressive. \u00a0 For each academic award or honor you\u2019ve won, you want to clarify its level of competitiveness by explaining the scope of the competition.\u00a0For example, was the science tournament you won a national one? A local one? A school-based one? Note that if the award has the word \"national\" or \"international\" in it, you shouldn\u2019t have to add much explanation to its description since it'll be obvious that the award is fairly selective. The overall point here is to show off! \u00a0 As you can see, there's a huge variety in the types of academic honors and awards examples you can put on your college application. The 70+ academic honors examples listed above are just some of the possible honors you could include. In general, the best academic honors to include on your application will have some or all of the following qualities: You won\u2019t have a ton of space on your application to explain the academic awards you\u2019ve won, so it\u2019s important to use the room you have wisely. To reiterate, here are our four best tips for how to talk about your academic awards and honors on your application: Now get out there and win some awards! \u00a0 Lots of colleges use the Common App. If you're going to be using this platform to apply to college, make sure you know what to expect with the Common App honors section.

As a member of the Democratic Party, he was the 47th vice president of the United States from 2009 to 2017 under Barack Obama. Biden also served as a senior senator from Delaware from 1973 to 2009.\n He tried to become the Democratic candidate for president in 1988 and 2008 but did not win. During the 2008 election, then-Senator Barack Obama picked him to be his running mate. He is a Roman Catholic.[2] Biden has received several awards. He has five honorary doctorates, including one from his alma mater and one from where he has taught law.[3] He has also earned the \"Best of Congress Award\", an award from the Pakistani government,[4] and the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction.[5]\n After finishing his second term as vice president, Biden began working at the University of Pennsylvania.[6] On April 25, 2019, Biden launched his presidential campaign for the 2020 election.[7] On April 8, 2020, Biden became the presumptive nominee for the Democratic nomination after Bernie Sanders ended his campaign.[8] On November 7, he defeated former President Donald Trump and became the president-elect of the United States.[9] He became president on January 20, 2021, after he became inaugurated. He is the oldest person to become president and the first from the state of Delaware. He is also the second Catholic president to hold the office after John F. Kennedy.\n Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942 at St. Mary's Keller Memorial Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania to a family of Irish Catholics.[10][11] His father, Joe Sr., was a businessman.[12] When he was young, his family moved to Wilmington, Delaware. He also began to stutter at an early age.[13] In high school, Biden played football and baseball, but he was not a very good student.[12] Biden attended college at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University. He did not have to fight in the Vietnam War because he was going to college and had asthma as a child.[14]\n For many years, Biden was a U.S. Senator from Delaware. Biden was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 when he was 29 years old. His election was somewhat of a surprise. The other candidate, J. Caleb Boggs, had more experience and more money to spend on his campaign.[15] He is one of the youngest people to become a U.S. Senator, because he was only two months older than the minimum age, 30, required to be one.[16] (While he was 29 during the election, he turned 30 before he became a senator.)\n Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times.[17] He became a prominent defender of Israel as a senator, and said that if there was no country like Israel the U.S. would have to make one.[18] Later in his time in the Senate, Biden served as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Foreign Relations committee deals with American issues in other countries. When Biden was chair, the committee dealt with the 1991 Gulf War, the 2003 War in Iraq, and several treaties. The Judiciary Committee dealt with the choice of Clarence Thomas, Robert Bork, and others for the Supreme Court (SCOTUS). Biden thought that Thomas and Bork should not be on the Court.[19] Though U.S. senators work in Washington, DC, Biden took the train home to Delaware every night.[20]\n Before becoming vice president, Biden was ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate,[21][22][23] which he said was because he was young when elected to the Senate.[24] In November 2009, Biden's net worth was $27,012.[25]\n Biden ran for president three times, in 1988, 2008 and 2020. The first time he was viewed as a good choice early on, but quit after it was discovered he gave a speech that was copied from Neil Kinnock, a British politician.[26]\n Biden tried again to get the Democratic Party's nomination in the 2008 presidential election.[27] He ran mostly on foreign issues, especially getting U.S. troops out of Iraq. Many thought of him as a good choice for Secretary of State.[28] He stopped his campaign on January 3, 2008 after he did not get many votes in the Iowa caucus.[29] However, he later became Barack Obama's pick for vice president due to what he knew about Iraq and because the working class liked him.[30][31]\n When Biden was running for president, he criticized Obama, talking about his lack of experience, but later he supported Obama to become president. His opponent as vice president was Sarah Palin, who had less experience but was seen as more interesting by the media.[32] Before the election, there were debates between the different candidates running for president or vice president. In the debate between Biden and Palin, many people believed that he knew more about running America than Palin did.[33] When Obama was elected president on November 4, 2008, Biden was elected vice president.\n Biden became vice president on January 20, 2009, and is the first person from Delaware and first Roman Catholic to be vice president.[34] When Biden became vice president, he said he would do things differently from Dick Cheney, who had been vice president before him.[35] Biden has said that his vice-presidency will not be like any other.[36]\n Biden's main role was as an advisor to Obama, mostly on issues of foreign policy and the economy. Obama has asked for Biden's input on most of his major decisions, such as who to put in his Cabinet and how to fight the War in Afghanistan.[36] Obama has put him in charge of groups to deal with the problems of the working class, as well as to watch the money in his stimulus bill.[37][38] Biden had also traveled to the Middle East several times on behalf of Obama and the U.S. while Vice President.[39] In 2011, Biden led talks on the budget and the debt. On November 6, 2012, Biden was re-elected for a second term as vice president along with President Barack Obama.\n In August 2015, Biden said that he was looking for a possible chance of running for president again in the 2016 U.S. election.[40][41] Biden formed a PAC for his possible run.[42] On October 21, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and President Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not to enter the race for the Democratic nomination for the presidency for the 2016 election.[43][44][45]\n Biden never had to break a tie vote in the United States Senate, making him the longest-serving vice president not to do this.[46]\n After winning the election, Biden served the Vice Presidency until January 20, 2017.\n During a tour of the U.S. Senate with reporters before leaving office on December 5, 2016, Biden said that a presidential bid was possible in the 2020 presidential election, after leaving office as vice president. While on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on December 7, he stated \"never say never\" about running for president in 2020, while also admitting he did not see a scenario in which he would run for office again.[47][48] On January 13, 2017, exactly one week before Donald Trump took office. he said he would not run.[49] However, four days later, on January 17, he took the statement back, saying \"I'll run if I can walk.\"[50]\n Biden was mentioned by many news outlets as a potential candidate for the 2020 Democratic nomination.[51] In March 2019, he said he may run.[52]\n He formally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019.[53]\n In April 2020, Biden became the only candidate in the primary making him the presumptive nominee for the nomination.[8] At first, he lost the first three primary contests to Senator Bernie Sanders. After winning the South Carolina primary, he gained traction and won most of the Super Tuesday races.\n Biden promised when elected he would protect Roe v. Wade decision, create a public option for health insurance, decriminalization of recreational cannabis, pass the Equality Act, create free community college, and a $1.7 trillion climate plan supporting the Green New Deal. He supports regulation instead of a complete ban on fracking.\n In early 2020, Biden promised he would pick a woman as his running mate. He also promised that his first Supreme Court appointment would be a black woman.[54] In August 2020, he picked California U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate.[55]\n On November 3, 2020, FiveThirtyEight's statistical model projected that Biden had a 89% chance to defeat Donald Trump.[56] He defeated Trump in the general election after officially being projected as the winner on November 7, 2020.[57] With more than 81 million votes, Biden received the most votes ever cast for a candidate in a U.S. presidential election.[58] However Trump did not call Biden the winner, refused to say he lost and tried to overturn the election results.\n Biden was elected the 46th President of the United States in November 2020, defeating the incumbent Donald Trump, the first sitting president to lose re-election since George H. W. Bush in 1992.\n He became the second non-incumbent vice president to be elected president, and the first Democrat to do so.[59] He is also expected to become the oldest president at the time of inauguration, as well as the first president from Delaware.\n At first, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy did not want to acknowledge Biden as the winner of the 2020 election.[60] On November 23, however, she formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[60]\n In late December 2020, Biden received his first dose of the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in Delaware.[61] He returned for his second dose in early January 2021.[62][63]\n Biden was inaugurated shortly before noon on January 20, 2021 as the 46th president of the United States.[64][65] At 78, he is the oldest person to become president.[64] He is the second Catholic president (after John F. Kennedy)[66] and the first president whose home state is Delaware.[67]\n In his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders, more than most recent presidents did in their first 100 days. Biden signed more executive orders than any other president since Franklin D. Roosevelt had in their first month in office.[68] His first actions were rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico, rejoining the World Health Organization, a 100-day mandatory face mask requirements on federal property and acts to stop hunger in the United States.[69][70][71][72] His presidency has been focused around his Build Back Better Plan agenda.[73]\n On February 4, 2021, he announced that the United States will stop giving weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for use in the Yemeni Civil War.[74]\n On March 11, 2021, the first anniversary of COVID-19 being declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus relief package.[75] The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, support for small businesses and state and local governments, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit.[76] Biden tried to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, but removed it from the stimulus package after criticism from both parties.[77][78]\n In March 2021, when there was an increase in migrants coming to the United States from Mexico, Biden told migrants: \"Don't come over.\" He said that the U.S. was arranging a plan for migrants to \"apply for asylum in place\", without leaving their original locations. In the meantime, migrant adults \"are being sent back\", Biden said, in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations.[79] Biden earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children and told the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help take care of children separated at the border.[80]\n On March 23, 2021, all of his cabinet members were confirmed by the United States Senate. Biden is the first president since Ronald Reagan in 1981 to have all of his original Cabinet secretary nominees confirmed to their posts.[81] Two days later, Biden announced that he would run for re-election in the 2024 election.[82][83]\n On April 22\u201323, Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the US would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%\u201352% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.[84][85]\n On April 28, 2021, Biden addressed the United States Congress in his State of the Union Address.[86] Presiding over this joint session was the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris as President of the Senate \u2015 the first time two women preside over an address to Congress.[86]\n On June 17, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which officially declared Juneteenth a federal holiday.[87] Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was declared a holiday in 1986.[88]\n In July 2021, when not many people were getting their COVID-19 vaccine and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, Biden said that the country has \"a pandemic for those who haven\u2019t gotten the vaccination\".[89] He also criticized the increase of COVID-19 misinformation on social media, saying it was \"killing people\".[90]\n By early July 2021, most of the American troops in Afghanistan were leaving or had left. On August 15, during an offensive by the Taliban, the Afghan government collapsed.[91] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to help the evacuation of American personnel and Afghan allies.[92] He has been criticized for the way he handled the withdrawal.[93] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves\", since the \"Afghan military collapsed [against the Taliban], sometimes without trying to fight\".[94]\n In August 2021, the Biden administration pushed for an infrastructure bill that can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the United States by 45% by 2030. He would also support lowering taxes for people who invest in renewable energy and electric vehicles and would add a fee on methane emissions.[95] The Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill,[96][97] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband.[98] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021.[99]\n In the start of 2022, Biden's approval ratings were low. He started speaking more in public.[100] Early in the year, Biden supported ending the U.S. Senate filibuster rule to pass a voting rights act.[101]\n In January, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer said he would retire from the Supreme Court.[102] Breyer's retirement gave Biden his first chance to nominate a justice to the Supreme Court. Biden had promised to nominate the court's first black female justice.[103] On February 25, Biden nominated D.C. Appeals Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to replace Breyer. She was confirmed on April 7th.[104][105]\n On 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[106] In response, Biden announced economic sanctions on Russia and Putin.[107]\n During 2022, President Biden had overseen a rise in gasoline prices and product goods because of rising inflation, with some blaming Biden's American Rescue Plan as a reason.[108] In May 2022, there was a nationwide shortage of infant formula.[109] During this time, there was an increase of use of \"I Did That!\" stickers, which showed Biden pointing to that phrase, as a form to criticize Biden for high gas prices.[110]\n In May 2022, two deadly mass shootings happened: one in a supermarket in Buffalo, New York which was racially motivated and another in an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. [111] While these mass shootings weren't the only ones that happened that month in the United States, the short time-frame it happened in garnered (got) attention and more people calling out gun violence.\n Biden tested positive for COVID-19 on July 21, 2022, after having mild symptoms such as fatigue, dry coughs, and a runny nose.[112][113] Five days later, he left isolation after testing negative.[114] However, on July 30, he tested positive again and went back to isolation.[115]\n On August 1, 2022, Biden announced the death of Al-Qaeda Emir Ayman al-Zawahiri in a U.S.-conducted airstrike that he approved.[116]\n On September 2, 2022, in a nationally televised Philadelphia speech, Biden said that Americans are in a \"battle for the soul of the nation.\" He called active Trump supporters \"semi-fascists,\" which Republican commentators criticized.[117][118][119]\n There have been many photographs of Biden hugging, kissing, and touching women and/or children in what commentators said to be inappropriate.[120][121][122] Biden has said that the behavior had got him in trouble in the past.[123]\n In March 2019, former Nevada assemblywoman Lucy Flores said that Biden kissed her without consent at a 2014 campaign rally in Las Vegas. Flores wrote that Biden walked up behind her, put his hands on her shoulders, smelled her hair, and kissed the back of her head.[124] In an interview with HuffPost, Flores stated she believed Biden's behavior should force him not to run in 2020.[125] By early April 2019, a total of seven women had made such allegations regarding Biden.[126]\n In April 2019, former Biden staffer Tara Reade said that she had felt uncomfortable many times when Biden touched her on her shoulder and neck while working in his Senate office in 1993.[127] In March 2020, Reade said Biden had pushed her against a wall and penetrated her while on Capitol Hill in 1993. Biden denied the allegations.\n While in college, he married his first wife, Nelia Hunter. They had three children: two sons (Beau and Robert) and a daughter (Naomi). After college, he became a lawyer and served on a County Council, a group of people who run a county. In 1972, Biden's family got into a car accident. Nelia and Naomi were killed, and Beau and Robert were hurt very badly.[128] Both survived the accident. Beau was the Attorney General in Delaware until January 2015 and served as a soldier in Iraq. Beau died from brain cancer on May 30, 2015 in Bethesda, Maryland at the age of 46.[129] Biden thought of resigning as vice president because of his son's death.[130]\n Biden married his second wife, Jill Tracy Jacobs Biden, in 1977.[131] She is a teacher and the former Second Lady of the United States. In 1981, they had a daughter, Ashley, who is now a social worker.[132][133] In 1988, Biden suffered from bleeding in his brain and needed brain surgery twice.[134] Because of what he saw in his family and neighborhood, Biden does not drink alcohol.[12][135]\n Biden lives just outside of Wilmington, Delaware and often goes there on the weekends since becoming president.[136] By November 2020[update], the Bidens were worth $9\u00a0million, mainly because of Biden's book sales and speaking fees after his vice presidency.[137][138][139]\n In February 1988, Biden had surgery to help heal a brain aneurysm.[140][141] While recuperating, he had a pulmonary embolism and recovered a few months later.[141] In November 2020, while playing with his two dogs Champ and Major, he suffered a stress fracture in his foot and was hospitalized.[142] In July 2022, it was revealed that Biden had some \"non-melanoma skin cancers\" removed before he became president.[143] That same month, he was diagnosed with COVID-19.[113]\n Biden has received honorary degrees from\nthe University of Scranton (1976),[144]\nSaint Joseph's University (1981),[145]\nWidener University School of Law (2000),[146]\nEmerson College (2003),[147]\nhis alma mater the University of Delaware (2004),[148]\nSuffolk University Law School (2005),[149] and his other alma mater Syracuse University (2009).[3]\n Biden got the Chancellor Medal from his alma mater, Syracuse University, in 1980.[150] In 2005, he got the George Arents Pioneer Medal\u2014Syracuse's highest alumni award[150]\u2014\"for excellence in public affairs.\"[151]\n In 2008, Biden got the Best of Congress Award, for \"improving the American quality of life through family-friendly work policies,\" from Working Mother magazine.[152]\nAlso in 2008, Biden shared with fellow Senator Richard Lugar the Hilal-i-Pakistan award from the Government of Pakistan, \"in recognition of their consistent support for Pakistan.\"[4] In 2009, Biden got The Golden Medal of Freedom award from Kosovo, that region's highest award, for his vocal support for their independence in the late 1990s.[153]\n Biden is an member of the Delaware Volunteer Firemen's Association Hall of Fame.[154]\n In 2017, during his final days as president, Barack Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction.[5]\n In 2020, Biden and his Vice President Kamala Harris were named Time Person of the Year.[155]\n  Trudeau \u00b7\n Macron  \u00b7\n Scholz \u00b7\n Meloni \u00b7\n Kishida \u00b7\n Sunak \u00b7\n Biden \n"], "https://www.zipjob.com/blog/awards-honors-on-resume/": [" Call us ZipJob Team 5 min read Today\u2019s job market is highly competitive, especially for those who are just graduating from school. They often find themselves up against other candidates with far more actual work experience. Unfortunately, they typically need to rely on their entry-level resumes to separate themselves from that competition and land the interview they need to get hired. But how can they do that without the relevant work experience that others may possess?  To overcome that challenge and impress hiring managers, they need to demonstrate that they have real achievements and ambition. The best way to do that is to properly list accomplishments, honors, and awards on a resume. Your awards, honors, and accomplishments can help bolster your resume and improve your chances of getting noticed by hiring managers. Why list awards, honors, and accomplishments on a resume? The fact is that hiring managers need to see something that suggests that you\u2019re a better employment prospect than those other applicants. Without valuable soft skills or a solid work history to rely on, you will need to focus attention on other key achievements. The good news is that your academic achievements in school can often help to showcase your capabilities during the job search. They can serve to demonstrate your ability to complete tasks, your ambition, and your competencies. More importantly, they reveal to future employers that you were a cut above other students at your school - something that could indicate that you\u2019ll also be an exceptional employee if you\u2019re hired. Most career advice experts will recommend that you focus attention on the most relevant awards, honors, and accomplishments. The problem is that few define \u201crelevant\u201d in that context. How can you tell which professional achievements will matter to any given employer? Yes, you should be proud of all your awards, honors, and accomplishments \u2013 but will a hiring manager care about the same things you value? In the end, it depends upon how you shape your resume format and message, and how you document those academic awards, honors, and accomplishments. For example, let\u2019s look at some common professional achievements that you may want to include in your resume: Academic or athletic awards Scholarships Awards provided for excellence in voluntary activities Awards that target specific academic achievements Job-related awards, if you have ever been employed Placement on the Dean\u2019s list or honor roll Exceptional grade point average Leadership positions at your school Professional associations Keep in mind that achieved recognition should only be limited to things that go above and beyond ordinary expectations. There is no added merit attached to showing up on time, getting along with others, or doing required work according to instructions. Those are all admirable, but they involve nothing more than meeting basic expectations. When you\u2019re listing relevant honors, awards, and academic excellence, you should focus on your truly exceptional achievements. Example: You should be listing these awards on honors at the very bottom of your resume - beneath your education section. Possible titles include: Awards and Honors Awards Professional Development and Awards You can even combine it with your education section: Education and Awards Since these awards, honors, and accomplishments are often difficult to tie to employment qualifications, you need to be careful to properly . Only include information that bolsters your prospects for getting hired. That means omitting any personal achievements and awards that are completely irrelevant to employment. Forget about that state fair cook-off award you won several years ago \u2013 unless you\u2019re applying for a job as a chef. Chances are that an accounting firm won\u2019t care that your chili was voted best in the state three years in a row! Be specific about the professional awards, honors, and accomplishments, and avoid vague language. If you were on the Dean\u2019s list for two straight years, don\u2019t just write that you received good grades. Instead, write: Dean\u2019s List 2016-2017, with 3.9 GPA. Received Student of the Year award in 2017, while at ABC University Accomplishments on a resume should usually be listed as a bullet point within the work experience section, or under your education/internship section. For leadership posts or other accomplishments, detail not just what you did but the impact that your actions had. For example: University Student Advisory Council, 2016-2017. Introduced two fund-raising programs that increased student participation by 28% and overall donor activity by 132%. Also worked to establish the ABC Student Scholarship program, which helps disadvantaged students cover textbook expenses. Finally, you should work to highlight these career achievements in a separate awards section. This will enable you to make sure that these high-points are seen by the hiring manager. This also provides an opportunity for you to develop some consistency in how the information is presented. For each of these achievements, include: The type of award, honor, or achievement \u2013 and when you received it What it recognizes Why it was important, and what you did to achieve it Whether it was a school, city, regional, or national award or honor For example, suppose that you were honored for your work as a student journalist on campus: 2017 Student Journalist of the Year Given in recognition of outstanding contribution to the world of student journalism and awarded for my series of stories on the increased student dropout rate at ABC University. The award offered national recognition from a coalition of newspaper and broadcast media. Your awards, honors, and accomplishments could make all the difference! The bottom line is clear: in a competitive job market, even your school awards, honors, and accomplishments matter!  Just be sure to tailor your resume to accommodate them and shape your message to highlight their relevance. Used properly, they could provide the push you need to get your foot in the door for that job interview you need.

These lenses are also being applied to personal visual devices, most often glasses. This type of lens can be made from any material, including polycarbonate and Trivex. Because they have a different, non-spherical design, they can improve how light refracts onto your retina while allowing you to wear a lighter material with less curvature. This means they are less likely to create the \u201ccoke bottle glasses\u201d effect. People who have higher order refractive errors, usually +4.00 diopters or more, benefit the most from aspherical lenses. Reading glasses and contact lenses are also being manufactured with this type of lens, so more people can benefit from clearer vision. Aspherical intraocular lenses (IOLs), which are implanted during cataract removal surgery, are also being recommended to manage refractive errors. There are a few downsides to aspherical lenses. The main issue is their cost since they take more effort to manufacture. These lenses may also require reflective coatings that traditional lenses do not, and they require accurate measurements of your pupillary distance. Since these lenses are getting increasingly popular, it is becoming easier to find them online and in brick-and-mortar retailers. Ask your optometrist for a recommendation on where to get these lenses. Aspheric lenses are a thinner, flatter type of lens for glasses. In the past, people who have higher prescriptions have needed thicker lenses to see clearly. Thanks to changes in the materials and technology of glasses, even people who are very nearsighted or farsighted can wear lightweight glasses and thin frames. This is much more convenient for people who wear glasses. These thinner lenses are more attractive, and they feel better resting on the face. These lenses are like those used for cameras. Originally, both concave and convex lenses for cameras were designed to represent part of a perfect sphere. However, these lenses cannot project an image that is uniformly focused across a flat surface, even in various combinations. This is because the depth of focus is too narrow. When applied to cameras, aspherical lenses correct these focus aberrations. Like aspheric camera lenses, aspheric glasses lenses improve the evenness of your focus. Thanks to adaptations in computer models of these lenses and improved manufacturing techniques, aspheric lenses are more common across dozens of applications, including for vision improvement. Many people who need glasses are switching to aspheric lenses for the vision benefits, comfort, and improved appearance. The term aspheric means \u201cnot spherical,\u201d which shows the main difference between these lenses and traditional lenses for glasses. Traditional lenses made from glass or plastic tend to have a slightly bulged shape, mimicking a sphere. These older designs follow a curve like that of your eye\u2019s cornea and lens, to adjust how light is refracted onto your retina. Traditional lenses can be large and heavy if you have a significant refractive error, like astigmatism, myopia, or hyperopia. Traditionally, lens shapes are: When lenses treat higher order vision problems, traditional lenses are thicker in some areas, which creates the \u201ccoke bottle lens\u201d effect. Many people find this unattractive and avoid wearing their glasses as a result. They may choose an alternative like contact lenses or LASIK, or they may simply avoid wearing their glasses, which can increase eye strain. Traditional lenses for glasses are also prone to spherical errors. These imaging errors or aberrations can create slightly blurry images since the light rays do not converge at one single point on the optical axis, which should be your retina. Light rays are refracted at slightly different degrees from different angles, depending on where they enter the eye through the lens. They collect in the general area of your retina, but the light could still be distributed so it does not create a clear image in your brain. Other problems with spherical lenses can include: In contrast, aspheric lenses are rotationally symmetric, with one or more nonspherical surfaces that differ from a sphere\u2019s shape. This improves how aberrations are corrected, so light rays are refracted on a more accurate point on your retina. Many people now opt for aspheric lenses because of their stylistic build and wide range when pairing with frames. However, these lenses offer more than just style and aesthetic value Anyone with a higher order refractive error can benefit from aspheric lenses. This is typically around +4.00 diopters or higher. Traditional glasses become bulky and heavy because they must be thick enough to correct curvature problems in your cornea or lens. Aspheric lenses can correct these refractive issues more effectively. Benefits of aspheric lenses include: While people who wear glasses benefit the most from aspheric lenses, contact lens manufacturers are also creating aspheric contacts, offering a similar, lower distortion effect. These are great for people with more active lifestyles who want or need a full range of view, including peripheral vision, which glasses may not correct. More reading glasses are being made with aspheric lenses too. Although aspheric lenses are recommended for people who need vision correction all the time, reading glasses at lower diopters can also benefit from being aspheric, especially if they are progressive lenses rather than bifocals. If you have cataracts that obscure your vision, you are likely to be recommended for cataract surgery. This process removes the natural lens of your eye and replaces it with an artificial lens, called an intraocular lens (IOL). For some people, these lenses can lead to refractive errors even when one did not exist before. This is because they do not refract light as well as a healthy natural lens. It can be difficult to predict how serious the refractive error will be because cataract surgery does not involve mapping the cornea, which refracts light too. If there is a shape change on the cornea, a refractive error can also develop. Some surgeons offer aspherical IOLs to offset potential refractive errors. A study measured preoperative corneal topography. Then, doctors chose an aspherical IOL based on the existing corneal aberrations, so that the sum of the two values was as close to zero as possible. While some surgeons are skeptical about the precision of aspheric IOL manufacturing measurements, approaching cataract surgery in this way can improve visual acuity outcomes for many people. While aspheric lenses are a great option for many people who wear glasses, it is important to make sure the center of the lens lines up with your pupil. Particularly with this type of lens, your vision can become distorted if the pupillary distance is off-center. Aspheric lenses are also more likely to have reflections, so it is important to get an anti-reflective coating on the lenses. This means that your lenses may cost more than traditional lenses made from plastic. Since aspheric lenses are a specific design or shape and not a type of material, you can get high-quality polycarbonate or even Trivex lenses that are aspheric. These can offer improved visual acuity. The biggest pitfall with aspheric lenses is their cost. Since there is more precision involved in the manufacturing process, they are harder to manufacture. As they become more common, this cost will likely decrease over time. Right now, spherical lenses are still simpler to make, and they typically cost less. Aspherical lenses are available in many places. If you buy your glasses through your optometrist, ask about aspherical lens options. If you purchase them at a store separately, you can find these options online or at a brick-and-mortar retailer. Some online retailers, for example, will ask during the glasses ordering process whether you want to upgrade to thinner, aspheric lenses for an additional charge. However, online retailers may not be able to get your pupil distance lined up properly, so purchasing these lenses in person may work better. You can ask a retailer in person about this option. If you do opt to order these lenses online, confirm the retailer\u2019s return policy if the pupillary distance isn\u2019t correct. You don\u2019t want to be stuck with lenses that don\u2019t work for you. Some online retailers have partnerships with brick-and-mortar stores. You can then visit these locations to get in-person help if something isn\u2019t right with your lenses. While still relatively new, aspheric glasses are widely accepted and recognized by eyewear professionals and eyeglass wearers. Some of the standout brands that provide quality aspheric lenses include: Before choosing your preferred aspheric lenses provider, you should consult an optometrist to determine which brands work best for your eye condition. \n        The information provided on this page should not be used in place of information provided by a doctor or specialist.

California today boasts a fabulously rich technology elite; it\u2019s also home to the highest poverty rate among the states, adjusted for costs, according to the U.S. Census. Under its largely one-party regime, notes liberal economist James Galbraith, California has seen inequality grow at among the fastest rates in the country. The state endures the widest gap between middle and upper incomes in the country\u201472 percent, compared with a national average of 57 percent. The Golden State may see itself as a standard-bearer among advanced economies, but it suffers a level of inequality worse than Mexico. According to a recent United Way study, close to one in three families in the state are barely able to pay their bills. California\u2019s one-party system revolves around well-organized and well-funded interests, including tech moguls, Hollywood executives, green nonprofits, and unions. These interests have all been enthusiastic Harris backers and funders, and the senator and vice presidential nominee has also won over Wall Street, which appreciates her hands-off approach to regulation. Any claim to populism\u2014in the sense of overturning the current order\u2014is fanciful when it comes to Harris. Her ties to the tech sector, including major backers of her failed presidential campaign, are particularly tight. Vox reports how she has \u201cglad-handed\u201d the tech top rank for decades, befriending the likes of Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg, venture capitalist John Doerr, former Yahoo boss Marissa Meyer, Salesforce.com founder Marc Benioff, and Lauren Powell Jobs, widow of Steve Jobs. In contrast to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, Harris is unlikely to push antitrust enforcement or defend free speech in ways that might inconvenience her backers. Concludes the radical-Left journal Jacobin: \u201cTech Monopolies Like Google Have a Friend in Kamala Harris.\u201d Yet closeness to Silicon Valley and Hollywood does not mean that Harris\u2019s ascent will be good for businesses outside the charmed circle of tech and media conglomerates. Harris has backed a state tax and regulatory regime that has devastated the state\u2019s middle and working classes. Once in the White House, she would presumably push similar policies ruinous for business\u2014particularly small businesses unable to cope with high taxes, restrictive labor laws, and ever-more draconian environmental regulation. Harris emerged last year as an early supporter of the Green New Deal, which roughly follows California\u2019s hard-core environmental regime. Unlike Joe Biden, she favors banning all fracking. As California attorney general, she vigorously fought to use climate change-driven laws to force Californians out of their cars and homes for the supposed pleasures of public transit and apartment living. Harris and her green allies are unlikely to be dissuaded by a long-term implosion in transit use, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, or by declining interest in urban living, even among millennial workers. Nor are they likely to reconsider renewable-energy policies, which enjoy heavy backing from the tech industry, though these policies consistently fail to deliver affordable, reliable energy, as Californians can attest to currently. A future Harris administration would likely impose California\u2019s green mandates on the nation. These measures have burdened California with electricity rates that since 2011 have increased five times as rapidly as the national average. They\u2019ve also been linked to wildfires and, seemingly every summer, rolling blackouts. The state\u2019s purposeful closing of nuclear and gas plants, notes environmental author Michael Shellenberger, means that \u201cthe tens of billions that Californians have spent on renewables come with high human, economic, and environmental costs.\u201d Under its local version of a Green Regime, California produces some high-wage jobs, but five times as many are below the median wage: a remarkable 86 percent of all new California jobs pay below the median income, while almost half pay under $40,000. Particularly vulnerable to the state\u2019s crippling energy prices has been the traditionally higher-paying industrial sector. Over the last decade, California has fallen to the bottom half of states in terms of manufacturing employment growth, last year ranking 44th, with a new job-creation rate one-third to one-quarter that of prime competitors, such as Texas, Virginia, Arizona, Nevada, and Florida. Though making up less than one-fifth of the state\u2019s population, the Bay Area\u2014the base for Harris, former governor Jerry Brown, current governor Gavin Newsom, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2014dominates California politics. With a large edge in Democratic registration, the area has been a fount of green and social-justice proposals cloaked in notionally progressive idealism but devastating to the middle and working classes. Any notion that the Bay Area exemplifies egalitarianism falls apart on quick scrutiny. As recently as the 1980s, the San Jose area boasted one of the country\u2019s most upwardly mobile economies, but with a greatly reduced industrial presence, it has morphed into what CityLab describes as \u201ca region of segregated innovation,\u201d where the rich add to their gains, the middle-class shrinks, and the poor live in increasingly chronic poverty. In San Francisco, a major center of the Bay Area tech scene, inequality grew most rapidly out of the nation\u2019s large cities in the last decade, according to the Brookings Institution. The left-leaning California Budget and Policy Center has named the city first in California for economic inequality. Yet despite this, and San Francisco\u2019s growing reputation as crime-ridden, filthy, and ungovernable, Harris\u2019s key allies still see the city as a role model for urban living. They ignore the reality that the vast majority of all new growth in the past decade has taken place in suburbs, even in the environs around San Francisco, which are 75 percent suburban. If Kamala Harris eventually ascends to the presidency, it would mark the final step in the historic transition of the Democratic Party from a venerable party of the middle and working class to one centered around the peculiar interests of the digital economy. Harris has emerged as the perfect vessel for this epochal transition. Her intersectional bona fides fit perfectly with those of the tech elite, which, long pilloried for its dearth of non-Asian minorities and apparent misogyny, has been front and center embracing the radical agenda of Black Lives Matter. Supposed stalwarts against racism and gender bias, tech pacesetters seem less concerned by the enormous gaps in class and race in their own backyards. Gregory Ferenstein, who interviewed 147 digital company founders, says most believe that \u201can increasingly greater share of economic wealth will be generated by a smaller slice of very talented or original people. Everyone else will increasingly subsist on some combination of part-time entrepreneurial \u2019gig work\u2019 and government aid.\u201d Rather than seek to democratize and boost competition within the economy, many tech leaders embrace expanding the welfare state, a position that resonates with Democratic activists. Former head of Uber Travis Kalanick, Y Combinator founder Sam Altman, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, and Elon Musk all favor this form of top-down socialism, where a publicly funded guaranteed annual wage helps soften the worst effects of \u201cdisruption\u201d on an increasingly redundant workforce. In a sense, the tech mavens have embraced the old aristocratic practice of offering what Marx called a \u201cproletarian alms bag\u201d\u2014not just with guaranteed wages but also with free health care, free college, and housing subsidies\u2014to a growing property-less class. The growth of a permanently dependent citizenry violates the aspirational character of the American republic, as would become more evident if Harris attains the helm. As California\u2019s attorney general, Harris was criticized by reformers for putting petty miscreants, like pot smokers, in jail, even while joking about her own use, and for being too deferential to law enforcement. In the post-George Floyd era, Harris has turned hard in the other direction, with nods towards support for \u201cdefunding\u201d the police and other policies fueling a new urban crime wave. But we can expect Harris to embrace her tough-prosecutor mode in going after political enemies; she joined lawsuits against fossil-fuel executives for voicing doubts about climate change. Under a Harris administration, we could expect further expansion of the de-platforming and censorship of those caught not \u201cright-thinking.\u201d The bottom line: don\u2019t underestimate Kamala Harris. She is a savvy political operator. She will be hailed by the compliant media as a progressive egalitarian and an ideal promoter of the American dream \u2014but if her past performance is any guide, she will be neither.

Anderson."], "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/us-vice-president-kamala-harris-how-is-she-doing/ar-AA15sq7d": [" Kamala Harris is the first female vice president in US history. She is now two years into her term in a job that has been far from easy. But is the VP doing what is necessary to fulfill her role?Kamala Harris' appointment as vice president of the United States was historic. She became the first woman, the first Black, and the first Asian ever to take on the role. The White House seemed to embrace the new VP, using the tagline \"Biden-Harris Administration,\" on social media to underscore the importance of the second-in-command.  But, in the months after Harris took office her leadership began to suffer. Reports soon emerged of a string of departures from key staff members and press coverage indicated the new VP was a demanding boss struggling to handle her political portfolio.  \"Exasperation and dysfunction: Inside Kamala Harris' frustrating start as vice president\" read one CNN headline.  \"Kamala Harris: The absentee VP by design,\" wrote the online newspaper The Hill, which cited the leader's lack of solo press conferences and scant one-on-one interviews as evidence of her fading into the background.  By her 11th month in office Harris' approval rating stood at 28% -- 10% below President Joe Biden.  However, while the public and media may have been dissatisfied with Harris' leadership, the vice president was doing exactly what was required of her, explained Amy Dacey, former CEO of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in an interview with DW.  The US constitution outlines only two roles for a vice president: take over when a president is unable to serve, and preside over the US Senate. Everything else is an added duty.  Harris plays key role as Senate tie-breaker  As president of the Senate, the vice president is designated to cast tie-breaking votes in the event of split decisions in the body. After the 2020 election the body was split evenly, 50-50 Democrats to Republicans (that balance shifted as a result of the 2022 midterms in which Democrats won a slim majority). This meant that Harris' vote was key to the Biden administration's legislative wins.  For example in August, Harris cast the tie-breaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, a federal law meant to fight inflation and promote domestic production. To date, she has acted as a tie-breaker 26 times -- topped by only two other vice presidents in US history (John C. Calhoun, 31; and John Adams, 29).  And, while Harris has presided over a divided US Senate on issues of pressing domestic and international importance, she has also been at the forefront of key diplomatic engagements abroad.  Working to help restore US diplomacy abroad While the Trump administration adhered to an \"America First\" policy, the Biden administration has sought to return to diplomacy and ensure America is \"respected around the world,\" explained Amy Dacey.  Harris has been a key diplomatic actor since taking office, attending the Munich Security Conference (MSC), for instance, a yearly meeting critical to trans-Atlantic relations. Delivering the keynote speech at the February 2022 installment of the MSC, she was vocal in stressing the Biden administration's support for Ukraine.  \"If Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States, together with our allies and partners, will impose significant and unprecedented economic costs,\" Harris said.  During her November visit to the Philippines, she underscored US support for the country in its territorial disputes with China. \"We stand with you in defense of international rules and norms as it relates to the South China Sea,\" Harris told President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.  Respect for the VP's international engagement is reflected in confidence in her leadership abroad. In a recent Pew Research Center survey roughly 55% of adults in 18 countries said they had confidence in her. That figure is on par with international confidence in US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, according to the survey.  However, as Harris has successfully served as a representative for the administration abroad, her domestic popularity has languished as she grapples with divisive tasks at home.  Harris' difficult domestic responsibilities Migration is a divisive issue among US politicians and the public, one that has been described as \"perilous\" and a \"political grenade\" by experts.  Yet that is one of the portfolios that Harris has been entrusted with by the Biden administration. Her foremost task has been to deal with the influx of migration of peoples into the US through Mexico and Central America's Northern Triangle -- made up of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.  For her first foreign trip Harris traveled to Guatemala and Mexico in June of 2021, saying she wanted to address the \"root causes\" of migration.  \"I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come. Do not come,\" said Harris in a press conference with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei.  In response, US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a fellow Democrat, tweeted, \"This is disappointing to see.\"  Republican lawmakers complained that Harris had not gone straight to the US-Mexico border. This September, Texas Governor Greg Abbott sent two buses of around 100 migrants and asylum seekers to the VP's home.  \"We will continue sending migrants to sanctuary cities like DC until Pres. Biden & Border Czar Harris step up & do their jobs to secure the border,\" Abbott wrote on Twitter.  Is Kamala Harris a failure or just misrepresented?  While Harris has had to deal with challenging assignments, her leadership has been far from a failure, according to Amy Dacey, who suggests the pressure she faces from the public and fellow lawmakers may have less to do with job performance and more with who she is and how she is represented.  Harris is dealing with the fact that she is both a minority and a woman in US politics. There are, for instance, no Black women currently serving in the US Senate, the very body she presides over. And politics in the US are also overwhelmingly male, especially in executive leadership -- the United States has yet to elect a female president. This creates added difficulty for women trying to get into politics in the US. These \"often feel like they've had to prove themselves in ways that men have not,\" explained Kelly Dittmar, an assistant research professor at Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP) in an interview with DW.  In 2020, Harris ran against Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primaries but dropped out of the race citing a lack of financial resources. Her exit had an added effect, according to Dittmer, who said Harris \"suffered from the perception that she was not ready, did not have the qualifications, was not electable as president.\"  But running for office and losing is not at all unusual for those with presidential ambitions. Joe Biden ran for the office twice before being elected. He also served as vice president for eight years.  Despite the wins and losses that have come with Harris' leadership, US politics do not happen in a vacuum. Each decision, engagement, and new legislation creates an incremental change even if the impact is not readily understood by the broader public, Amy Dacey explained.  But these small wins often fall outside of Kamala Harris' main role as a vice president. A job that she may already be fulfilling.  Edited by: Jon Shelton Copyright 2022 DW.COM, Deutsche Welle.

Question: What is meant by \"list any honors you have received\" on a college application?

Examples of such awards might include (from an actual student application):  National AP Scholar; National Merit Semifinalist; First Place Research and Position Paper\u2014Stanford Model United Nations; Impromptu finalist and Oratorical Interpretation Semifinalist\u2014Santa Clara University Speech Competition; National History Day Essay selected at local level and went to State level  Some students have too many \u201chonors\" to fit on their application forms while others can't seem to dredge up any at all without forcing the issue (\u201cFirst to earn Toilet-Training Diploma at Three Little Pigs Child Care Center\" ;)) When it comes to deciding what should go on your \u201chonors\" list, you do have a lot of wiggle room, and you shouldn't worry that you will hurt your admission chances by making a \u201cwrong\" choice.

For instance, if you were voted class treasurer or varsity soccer captain, you would probably list these achievements in the \u201cActivities\" section of your application. But something like, \u201cGolden Bookmark Award for completing the most summer reading at local public library\" may be in your Activities list \u2026 or not. That's one of those \u201cgray area\" things that could fall in between categories.

For instance, five of the top graduating seniors might receive an award for excelling in AP math.\u00a0 While these awards will vary in name from school to school, they're all equally illustrious and certainly worthy of a spot on your college application! Sometimes, an academic honor isn't commemorated by a plaque or medal. Rather, it's simply a number. Are you one of the top 10 students in your graduating class?\u00a0What about the top 5% or 10%? Your guidance counselor can let you know your exact class rank so you'll know how to accurately list it. Don't scoff at a Perfect Attendance award or think it doesn't deserve a place on your application. This is an important distinction that shows admissions officers that you've worked hard in high school, possessing a great degree of dedication.\u00a0 Of course, one that spans your entire, four-year academic career is the most impressive! Did you compete in the Quiz Bowl? What about the National Science Bowl or National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)? From spelling bees to book trivia contests, there are many different kinds of acacemic contests that allow high school students to showcase their knowledge. If you or your team did well in any of these contests, include your rank in the academic honors section of your application! Many high schools will award special students who go above and beyond, demonstrating impressive leadership skills, character traits or academic excellence. Did you receive such an award at any point during your high school career? If so, list it with pride! Deciding to learn a foreign language is an impressive endeavor at any age, let alone while you're also trying to juggle your high school studies.\u00a0 Any foreign language award received is a high honor and one to definitely list. One of the most recognized ones is called\u00a0The Seal of Biliteracy, though there are other organizations that also recognize students who graduate knowing more than one language. You've worked hard to earn the academic honors you receive. When you're ready to begin thinking about college, don't forget to\u00a0remember\u00a0these recognitions! Sometimes, achievements that you might not consider particularly noteworthy reveal the depths of your character and commitment. Give this step plenty of thought and you'll be well on your way toward crafting an attention-worthy application!

She is the President of the economic website World Money Watch. As a writer for The Balance, Kimberly provides insight on the state of the present-day economy, as well as past events that have had a lasting impact. Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images \nSince World War I, there have been eight Democratic presidents. Democrats are known to prefer\u00a0government spending\u00a0over\u00a0tax cuts, especially for the wealthy,\u00a0as a way to boost the economy. One exception is often for\u00a0defense, where many Democrats are considered weaker than Republicans, although some Democratic presidents such as Lyndon B. Johnson did invest heavily in national security. The general impression is that Democrats don't worry as much about balancing the budget as Republicans do, although recent Republican administrations, and notably that of Donald Trump, greatly increased America's national debt and deficit under his watch. At the same time, the last time the U.S. ran a budget surplus was under Bill Clinton, a Democratic president.\n \nOften, the economic policies of Democratic presidents are dictated by the situations they preside over.\u00a0Most of them, for example, were forced to employ\u00a0expansionary fiscal policy\u00a0to pull the country out of a\u00a0recession\u00a0or\u00a0depression. Many also had to increase defense spending due to overseas conflicts or wars.\u00a0\n \nThe chart below outlines the change in real gross domestic product (GDP) during a few Democratic president's terms (highlighted in gray), according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n \nHere's an analysis of the eight Democratic presidents since World War I, their economic policies, and how much they followed their party's policies.\n \nPresident Woodrow Wilson signed the\u00a0Federal Reserve Act\u00a0in 1913, establishing the nation's central bank. He added a central board to balance the bankers\u2019 regional structure.\u00a0Congress\u00a0wanted the Fed to have 12 regional banks to represent America's diverse regions. The compromise means that people are confused as to who owns the Fed to this day.\n \nWilson signed the\u00a0Underwood-Simmons Tariff Act in 1913. It reduced tariffs on manufactured goods and raw materials. This lowered costs for consumers. To compensate for the loss in revenue, it also created a graduated federal income tax. Most workers at that time made too little to get hit with the tax. The reduction in tariffs did not immediately reduce the cost of imports. World War I broke out the following year, reducing European production.\n \nIn 1914, Wilson instructed Congress to create\u00a0the\u00a0Clayton Anti-Trust Act. It expanded on the Sherman Act to limit\u00a0monopolies'\u00a0power. At around the same time, the Federal Trade Commission was established to enforce these laws..\n Germany sank the British ocean liner Lusitania in 1915. Wilson warned any further attacks would cause the U.S. to enter World War I. \nWilson declared war on April 6,\u00a01917, after Germany attacked U.S. merchant ships. In\u00a01916, Wilson signed three acts while gearing up for the war. First,\u00a0the\u00a0Adamson Act\u00a0created the eight-hour workday for\u00a0railroad workers. Wilson wanted to avoid a strike by the railroad unions while the country was gearing up for World War I. That set the standard for Ford Motor Company to do the same 10 years later.\n \nThe\u00a0Federal Farm Loan Act\u00a0set up government loans to farmers\u00a0to develop and expand their farms. He also signed the\u00a0Keating-Owen Act. It banned articles produced by child labor from being sold in interstate commerce. The Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional two years later.\n \nGermany surrendered in 1918. Wilson brokered the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, which called for the establishment of the League of Nations. The Republicans in Congress defeated it. He received a Nobel Prize for his efforts to promote peace.\n Wilson vetoed the Volstead Act, which enforced the 18th Amendment prohibiting alcohol in 1919.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff Congress overrode his veto, launching Prohibition. \nWilson advocated for\u00a0the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote in 1920.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n \nPresident Wilson was the second-largest contributor to the debt percentage-wise. He added $21 billion to the national debt, which was a 722% increase during his time in office.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff That was because of World War I. During his presidency, the Second Liberty Bond Act gave\u00a0Congress\u00a0the right to adopt the\u00a0national debt ceiling.\ufeff\ufeff\n \nFranklin D. Roosevelt was sworn in\u00a0at the height of the\u00a0Great Depression. He had won the election by\u00a0promising a\u00a0New Deal\u00a0to end it. He introduced Keynesian economic theory, which said government spending could help end a recession.\n \nFDR rallied Americans around\u00a0government spending. The\u00a0Works Progress Administration employed\u00a08.5 million people to build public works. The\u00a0Civil Works Administration\u00a0created 4 million construction jobs.\n \nHe\u00a0created new agencies to safeguard investments, create jobs, and\u00a0provide social safeguards. They included Social Security, the\u00a0Securities\u00a0and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the\u00a0Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. He also passed the\u00a0U.S. minimum wage\u00a0and child labor laws.\n The New Deal helped the country recover from the Depression by the early 1930s. Under pressure from Congress, FDR cut spending to try and balance the budget. Despite fiscal conservatism, the economy fell into a recession again in 1937.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff \nIn 1939, Hitler invaded Poland. FDR started gearing up to enter the war. He began the draft in 1940. In 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. FDR increased the\u00a0defense budget, adding billions to the debt to pay for World War II.\n \nBy 1945, Roosevelt had added $236 billion to the debt, a 1,048% increase over\u00a0the $23 billion debt at the end of Hoover's last budget, in\u00a0fiscal\u00a0year\u00a01933. Percentage-wise, FDR added the most U.S. debt by a\u00a0president.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n \nHarry Truman took America from isolationism to global leadership. He took office on April 12, 1945, because FDR died.\u00a0Germany surrendered on May 8. Japan surrendered on Aug. 14, 1945, ending World War II.\u00a0\n \nMany felt Truman forced Japan's surrender when he dropped atom bombs on Hiroshima on August 6 and Nagasaki on August 9. Others felt the bombing was unnecessary since Japan was ready to surrender. The Air Force had bombed Tokyo and most other major industrial cities. The Navy had blockaded Japan's imports of oil and other vital materials. Truman's\u00a0Chief of Staff, William Leahy, wrote, \"By the beginning of September, Japan was almost completely defeated through a practically complete sea and air blockade.\" But Truman felt the atom bomb was absolutely necessary.\n Truman supported the formation of the\u00a0United Nations\u00a0in 1945 and the\u00a0North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\u00a0in 1949. \nIn 1947, he outlined\u00a0The Truman Doctrine\u00a0to contain the threat of communism.\ufeff He pledged the United States to assist any democracy attacked by authoritarian forces. The Doctrine shifted U.S. foreign policy from isolationist to the global policeman.\ufeff\ufeff\n \nHe vetoed the\u00a0Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which would have\u00a0weakened unions.\ufeff It also required union leaders to swear they were not communists. It allowed the president to stop strikes if they endangered national safety.\ufeff\ufeff\n In 1947, Truman supported Secretary of State George Marshall's plan to rebuild Europe.\u00a0The Marshall Plan\u00a0pledged $12 billion in food, machinery, and\u00a0foreign direct investment.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\u00a0 \nThe 1947\u00a0National Security Act\u00a0consolidated the Army and Navy into the Defense Department. It created the Air Force, the National Security Council, and the CIA.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\u00a0\n \nIn 1948, Truman\u00a0airlifted food and fuel in West Berlin\u00a0after the Soviets blockaded the city between June 24, 1948, and May 12, 1949.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff He recognized the country of Israel after it declared statehood in May 1948. He said it was a matter of justice for the Jewish people.\ufeff\n \nTruman outlined the\u00a0Fair Deal\u00a0on Jan. 5, 1949.\u00a0It called for national health insurance and raising the\u00a0minimum wage. It\u00a0also proposed the Fair Employment Practices Act to make illegal any religious and racial discrimination in hiring. Congress rejected certain aspects of the proposal, but passed the rest of the Fair Deal.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n \nIn 1950, Truman added a\u00a0cost of living adjustment\u00a0to Social Security payments.\ufeff\n \nNorth Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950. General MacArthur led the UN forces that pushed North Korea back to the 38th parallel. That border held when the ceasefire was negotiated in 1953.\n Truman decided not to run for a third term, even though he could have. The\u00a022nd Amendment, ratified\u00a0in 1951, limited presidents to two terms but did not apply to Truman because his first term was to fulfill FDR's third term..\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff \nThe\u00a0Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952\u00a0continued quotas for immigrants based upon country of origin. It allowed Asians to immigrate after the War. It prioritized family reunification and desired skills. Truman vetoed the Act because it had lower quotas for Asians, which he felt was discriminatory. But the Act passed anyway.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n \nTruman added $7 billion to the national debt, a 3% increase from the $259 billion debt at the end of FDR\u2019s last budget in 1945.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n \nJohn F. Kennedy directed federal agencies to accelerate their budgeted spending to end the 1960\u00a0recession.\u00a0He created a food stamp program and expanded\u00a0the United States Employment Service.\u00a0He increased the minimum wage, improved Social Security benefits, and passed an urban renewal package. JFK asked the\u00a0Federal Reserve\u00a0to keep interest rates low by using its\u00a0open market operations to buy\u00a0U.S. Treasury notes.\n \nIn\u00a0December 1962, JFK proposed additional education and research\u00a0spending. He suggested cutting the top income tax rate from 91% to\u00a065%.\u00a0He endorsed\u00a0deficit spending\u00a0until businesses began hiring again.\n Kennedy's primary military concern was preventing the expansion of communism. \nIn February 1961, Kennedy authorized the\u00a0Bay of Pigs invasion\u00a0to overthrow the communist leader Fidel Castro.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff In June 1961, he met with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who threatened to cut off U.S. access to Berlin. JFK increased military spending\u00a0by adding intercontinental ballistic missile forces. On Aug. 13, 1961, the Soviets\u00a0erected the\u00a0Berlin\u00a0Wall.\n \nIn\u00a0October 1962, Kennedy blockaded Cuba after finding out that the Soviets were building nuclear missile sites. The USSR removed the sites.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff In 1963, JFK increased U.S. military advisers in Vietnam to more than 16,000. That gave U.S. support to the November 1963 military coup.\n \nOn\u00a0Oct. 24, 1963, Kennedy signed the Maternal and Child Health and Mental Retardation Planning Amendment to the Social Security Act. It provided funding to states to improve their programs. On Oct. 31, 1963, he signed the\u00a0Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act. It funded community mental health centers to provide better care than mental hospitals. But there were consequences to this deinstitutionalization.\u00a0\u00a0\n Kennedy was one of the four presidents who donated his salary. \nKennedy added $16 billion to the\u00a0national debt by 1963, an 5.8% increase from the $289 billion debt at the end of Eisenhower's last budget in 1961.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff His deficit spending\u00a0ended the recession and contributed to an expansion that lasted until 1970.\u00a0\n \nLyndon B. Johnson\u00a0was sworn in\u00a0on\u00a0Nov. 22, 1963, after\u00a0John F. Kennedy was assassinated. After completing the final year of\u00a0JFK's term, he was\u00a0elected in 1964\u00a0with 61% of the votes. This electoral mandate allowed him to expand the federal\u00a0government's role and avoid\u00a0any\u00a0recessions. The Fed used\u00a0contractionary monetary policy\u00a0to cool growth and prevent inflation.\n \nLBJ created Medicare, Medicaid, and\u00a0urban renewal initiatives. He championed\u00a0equal rights for all to vote, ride buses, and go to school. LBJ escalated the Vietnam War but could not win it.\n \nHe signed the Revenue Act of 1964 to lower the top income rate from 91% to 70%. It reduced the corporate tax rate from 52% to 48%. It created the minimum standard deduction. According to the Tax Foundation, the cuts spurred the economy enough that revenue increased 33%.\n In 1964, LBJ created the Great Society. It changed the definition of the\u00a0American Dream\u00a0from one of opportunity to one that guaranteed well-being. \nLBJ's Great Society increased spending on education and health care. Medicare covered hospitalization for seniors and Medicaid provided health care for those\u00a0living below the\u00a0poverty level.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\u00a0It created the National Endowment for the Arts, Public Broadcasting Services, and drivers\u2019 education. LBJ created new programs to address crime and delinquency, as well as beautification and\u00a0conservation. The Department of Housing and Urban Development built public housing and redeveloped slums.\u00a0\n \nIn 1965, LBJ sent\u00a0over 100,000 combat troops to Vietnam. By 1968, he\u00a0increased the\u00a0defense budget to\u00a0support\u00a0500,000 troops. The\u00a0increased\u00a0government spending\u00a0added $42 billion, or 13%, to the\u00a0national debt by 1968.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n \nJimmy Carter's presidency was overshadowed by\u00a0the stagflation created by\u00a0Richard Nixon. Stagflation combines economic contraction with double-digit\u00a0inflation. Carter worked hard to combat the continuing economic woes of inflation and unemployment. He added more than 10 million jobs. But, it wasn't enough to combat the effects of double-digit inflation and the Fed's efforts to end it.\n \nCarter created the Department of Education and bolstered Social Security. He established\u00a0a national energy policy that deregulated oil prices to spur domestic production. He also deregulated the trucking and airline industries. He expanded the national park system.\n \nIn 2002, he received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in the 1978 Camp David Accord. He established full diplomatic relations with China and negotiated the SALT II nuclear limitation treaty with the Soviets.\n \nOn Nov. 4, 1979, Iranian students took 66 Americans hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Although Carter's administration negotiated a release in December 1981, it was too late to save Carter's presidency.\u00a0\n \nBill Clinton's economic policies fostered a decade of prosperity. He added 18.7 million new jobs,\u00a0more than any other president. Homeownership was 67.7%, the highest rate ever recorded at that time. The\u00a0poverty rate\u00a0dropped to 11.3%.\n \nHe signed the\u00a0North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It\u00a0boosted growth by eliminating tariffs between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\u00a0\n Clinton created a budget surplus of almost $70 billion.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff He did this with the\u00a0Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act\u00a0of 1993. It raised taxes on the wealthy.\ufeff\ufeff He also cut spending by reforming welfare.\ufeff\ufeff \nClinton did not achieve\u00a0health care reform. But he did get the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u00a0(HIPAA) and\u00a0the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program\u00a0(CHIP) passed. HIPAA improved the portability of insurance and coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. CHIP subsidizes health insurance for children in families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.\u00a0\n \nBarack Obama entered office during\u00a0the\u00a02008 financial crisis. He fought it with the\u00a0American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). It added over $830 billion to the debt by cutting taxes, extending unemployment benefits, and funding public works projects. He\u00a0bailed out the U.S. auto industry\u00a0in March 2009.\u00a0That saved jobs and forced the companies to become more fuel-efficient.\n On Oct. 9, 2009, Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in international diplomacy.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\u00a0 \nOn March 23, 2010, Obama signed the\u00a0Affordable Care Act. It required everyone to have\u00a0health insurance\u00a0or pay a tax. That provided a steady stream of premiums from enough healthy people to pay for the millions of people with\u00a0pre-existing conditions\u00a0who were no longer denied insurance.\u00a0Obamacare\u00a0expanded Medicaid. That allowed more people to get\u00a0preventive care\u00a0instead of using hospital emergency rooms as their primary care physicians. As a result, it slowed the\u00a0rise of health care costs.\n \nIn July 2010, the\u00a0Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act\u00a0improved regulation of certain areas that led to the financial crisis. The\u00a0Consumer Financial Protection Agency\u00a0(CFPA) reduced harmful practices of credit cards and mortgages. The Financial Stability Oversight Council regulated\u00a0hedge funds\u00a0and\u00a0banks\u00a0that became\u00a0too big to fail. The \"Volcker Rule\" banned banks from risking losses with their depositors' money. Dodd-Frank directed the\u00a0SEC\u00a0and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate\u00a0derivatives.\n \nOn May 1, 2011, Navy SEALs eliminated Osama bin Laden, the leader of the 9/11 attacks. Later that year, Obama\u00a0ended the\u00a0Iraq War.\u00a0Three years later, he sent troops back under renewed threats from the Islamic State. In 2014, Obama wound down the war in Afghanistan.\n \nIn\u00a02015, Obama brokered a\u00a0nuclear peace agreement with Iran. Later that year, the administration negotiated the\u00a0Trans-Pacific Partnership. He negotiated the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership\u00a0between the U.S. and the\u00a0European Union.\u00a0\n On Dec. 12, 2015, Obama finalized the\u00a0International Climate Agreement to stop climate change. \u00a0 \nObama announced\u00a0carbon reduction regulations\u00a0in 2014.\u00a0He enacted the Clean Power Plan in 2015. It should reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 32% from 2005 levels by 2030. It does this by setting carbon reduction goals for the nation's power plants.\ufeff\ufeff\n \nObama increased the national debt\u00a0by more than $8 trillion while in office.\ufeff\ufeff\u00a0Federal income\u00a0was down, thanks to lower tax receipts from the\u00a02008 financial crisis.\n Federal Reserve History. \u201cFederal Reserve Act Signed by President Wilson.\u201d U.S. International Trade Administration. \"The Creation of the U.S. Tariff Commission,\" Page 88.

However, manufacturing such lenses requires control over curvature at the submicron level (1/10,000th of a millimeter). It was considered so difficult to achieve such precision that the lenses were\r\n            once called \u201cdream lenses\u201d.  Over half a century ago in 1971, Canon finally released an interchangeable lens for SLR cameras that included aspherical lens elements. Since then, the company has continued to refine processing methods and precision\r\n            technology, spearheading the constant improvement of image quality via aspherical lenses. Aspherical Lenses (Created: December 2006 03'05'') Image shot with spherical lens element  Image shot with aspherical lens element  Conventional lens elements have a curved surface shaped like a slice of a sphere, which is why they are called \u201cspherical\u201d lens elements. Compared to light rays passing through the center of a spherical element, rays\r\n            entering from its peripheries must travel a longer distance in order to reach the image plane, resulting in the light rays converging at different positions. This causes an effect known as spherical aberration, where point light sources\r\n            \u201cblur\u201d instead of being rendered as points.  With aspherical lenses, the curvature changes towards the lens peripheries, ensuring that all light rays converge at the same position, thereby reducing spherical aberration.  Spherical aberration on a spherical lens element An aspherical lens element ensures light rays converge at the same position. Distortion is another type of aberration that can be effectively corrected using aspherical lens elements. Wide-angle lenses are prone to barrel distortion, whereas telephoto lenses are prone to pincushion distortion.\r\n           While aspherical lens elements can correct various types of aberration, one aspherical lens alone cannot correct everything. Rather, it must be used in combination with a number of other lenses, and the type of aberration\r\n            that the aspherical lens element corrects changes depending on its relative position within the configuration of the lens. For example, barrel distortion is effectively corrected by placing aspherical lens elements near the front of\r\n            the lens configuration.  Image shot with a spherical lens element (shows barrel distortion) Image shot with an aspherical lens element The theory behind aspherical lenses and their use in correcting aberrations has been known for a very long time. In fact, such lenses have been used in astrometric telescopes since the early 1900s. The difference in surface\r\n            curvature between an aspherical lens and a spherical lens is so subtle that it is not visible to the human eye, and requires submicron-level precision measurements and processing to replicate. There were also many huge obstacles that\r\n            stood in the way of producing aspherical lenses that could be used on cameras, such as mass production capability and the need to produce lenses capable of correcting aberrations at wider angles\u2014different from the existing telescopes.\r\n           FD55mm f/1.2AL (released in 1971\uff09 In the face of these challenges, Canon remained committed to their vision of bringing higher-image-quality lenses to more users. In 1963, it commenced research and development aimed at applying the yet-unexplored\r\n              aspherical lens technology to camera lenses, and in 1969, released a prototype in the form of the FL55mm f/1.2AL at a camera expo in Japan. Two years later, in 1971, the first large-aperture SLR lens employing an aspherical lens was\r\n              released\u2014the FD55mm f/1.2AL.\r\n             The journey to mass-produce aspherical lens elements involved the incorporation of advanced technologies developed for the space exploration program, culminating in the development of the ALG-Z ultra-high-precision\r\n            aspherical lens grinder and the ALM ultra-high-precision measuring machine. The use of a laser interferometer ensured fine control over equipment grinding, which made possible surface grinding precision down to units of 100nm*\r\n            for shaping and 50nm for processing. Combined with the uniform grinding and polishing techniques that Canon had developed based on its own theories, these technologies made it possible to mass produce more than 1,000 pieces of ground and\r\n            polished aspherical lenses per month.\r\n           Later, Canon also succeeded in developing plastic-molded (PMo) aspherical lenses, which can be mass produced in larger quantities at a lower cost, and large-diameter glass-molded (GMo) aspherical lenses, which are molded in\r\n            a machine that incorporates a high-precision aspherical metal mold*.\r\n            In 1990, Canon developed a fourth aspherical lens production technology that produces replica aspherical lenses by using ultraviolet-light-hardening resin to form an aspherical lens surface layer on a spherical lens\r\n            element.\r\n           Taking such factors as desired image quality and intended use into consideration, Canon chooses the most appropriate of its four aspherical lens production technologies for each lens in its continuing efforts to develop\r\n            high-quality lenses.\r\n           A lens element used in the EF11-24mm f/4L USM, which has the world\u2019s largest lens diameter*. In the production process for lenses, each piece of glass is individually ground and polished, thus producing extremely high-precision lenses. The process is suitable for different types of glass, and can be used to\r\n                produce aspherical lens elements that have a large diameter or a large displacement factor relative to spherical lenses. These lens elements are mainly employed in lenses designed for professional users that require very high image\r\n                quality.  First, the glass is carved and ground using a grindstone that contains diamond. The thickness, exterior, and aspherical shape are ground to 100nm-level precision. The aspherical shape of each lens is then measured in\r\n              detail. Next, the measurement results are used to generate a program that will polish the glass so that it fits the design requirements. The measurement and polishing steps are repeated until the margin of error is no more than 50nm.\r\n             PMo aspherical lens elements are formed by injecting resin into an aspherical surface mold. Highly suitable for mass production, they play a major role in improving the image quality of entry-level lenses, such as the\r\n            EF-S10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM (released in 2014), which need to be kept relatively affordable. Resin is injected into a high-precision mold that takes the shape of an aspherical lens. After the lens element is separated from the mold, coatings are added to finish the lens. \nGlass-molded (GMo) aspherical lens elements \n Molds for high-precision aspherical lenses GMo aspherical lens elements are manufactured by softening glass material under high temperatures and then shaping it using a molding machine. Suitable for large quantity manufacturing, the resulting lens element retains the\r\n                scratch- and heat-resistant properties of glass.Ever since the very first batch of GMo aspherical lenses Canon produced, the molding equipment used to make the lenses has been developed and manufactured in-house, making possible\r\n                the ultra-high precision that the lens designs require.  Production processGlass material is softened under high temperatures, then shaped using a high-precision aspherical lens press mold machine. After the\r\n                molded glass is cooled, it is put through various quality tests before it is finished. As the constitution depends on the type of glass used, the temperature, time, and pressure required in the molding process also differs. Replica aspherical lens elements are produced by using an aspherical surface mold and ultraviolet-light-hardening resin to form an aspherical surface layer on a spherical glass lens. As this process is not restricted by\r\n            factors such as the size of the spherical glass base or the glass material used, it offers high design flexibility. Ultraviolet-light-hardening resin is dripped onto a spherical glass lens, which is then inverted and transferred into an aspherical surface press mold and placed under ultraviolet rays. The resin hardens under the\r\n              ultraviolet rays, forming an aspherical surface.  With their powerful aberration correction capabilities, aspherical lens elements are useful for such purposes as improving image quality, achieving smaller and lighter lens designs, or realizing high-performance\r\n                specifications. In Canon\u2019s EF and RF lens lineups alone, they can be found in over 100 assorted lens models, ranging from entry-level models to those designed for professional users.

The terms of the settlement were not immediately disclosed publicly. Kenosha-based Snap-on sued Harbor Freight last year, accusing the California-based company of selling floor jacks that \u201care substantially identical in shape and appearance\u201d to ones sold by Snap-on. The lawsuit alleged the sale of the jacks amounted to patent and trade dress infringement and unfair competition. Snap-on sells its 2-ton and 3-ton floor jacks for $550 to $650 while Harbor Freight offers its similar models for $199 or less. U.S. District Court Judge Lynn Adelman ruled in January that there were similarities between the designs \u201cthe overall effect of each design on the eye of the ordinary observe is different.\u201d Adelman at that point denied a Snap-on motion seeking a preliminary injunction against Harbor Freight. In answering Snap-on\u2019s complaint, Harbor Freight made a counterclaim of its own, accusing Snap-on of false and misleading advertising and seeking to stifle competition. Harbor Freight argued Snap-on \u201ctried to exploit patriotic leanings of some customers.\u201d \u201cBelieving that many consumers prefer jacks made in the United States\u2014and will not pay $550 to $650-plus for jacks made in China\u2014Snap-on has deceptively and repeatedly told consumers that the FJ200 and FJ300 are \u2018assembled in the USA,\u2019\u201d the Harbor Freight counter claim says. Snap-on denied the Harbor Freight allegations, but did acknowledge some parts for the jacks are made in China. Harbor Freight also alleged Snap-on\u2019s jacks were made in the same factory as the Harbor Freight ones and the company\u2019s business model is what caused a higher price. Snap-on denied those allegations in its response. The two companies were scheduled to complete discovery in the case by mid-October. There had been no new filings made since March, but attorneys for the two sides stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of all claims and counterclaims in a filing made last week. While the settlement \u201cis confidential, what we can say is that we\u2019re pleased with the outcome. We\u2019re continuing to sell the Daytona jack and did not have to make any payment to Snap-On,\u201d said Karen Denne, a Harbor Freight spokesman.

Political news rarely gets much grimmer than it did for Joe Biden on July 26, when he was greeted by a surprise poll showing that, were he to run again in a contested primary in New Hampshire, he might command less than one-fifth of the vote. It was a far-fetched hypothetical \u2014 the likes of Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren won\u2019t challenge him if he runs for reelection \u2014 but the dearth of support for a sitting president was still galling. And yet, improbably, the news was even worse for his presumptive heir: Kamala Harris was all the way down in the single digits. The vice-presidency is, by definition, a nearly impossible job. There\u2019s the prestige and the \u201cone heartbeat away\u201d of it all but few defined responsibilities and political pitfalls at every turn. Eighteen months in, thanks to a combination of Biden\u2019s age and unpopularity, the lingering pandemic and punishing inflation, a relentless opposition, and \u2014 most visibly \u2014 her own struggles to communicate a satisfactory role for herself, Harris has reached an unparalleled low point. \u201cThere\u2019s a cruel irony to the thing, which is you are almost as big a target as the president for the opposition and critics, but by definition you need to keep a lower profile because no one wants to upstage the boss, and you don\u2019t ever want to be in a position where you\u2019re saying anything even a millimeter differently,\u201d said a veteran operative who has worked with three Democratic vice-presidents. Harris is partly a victim of the enormous expectations placed on her when Biden thought he was selecting the future leader of a vibrant, thriving post-Trump Democratic Party. And if you ask some of her supporters, she may be one of the few things keeping the Biden administration\u2019s languishing popularity barely afloat, leaving Democrats with a conundrum: a successor-in-waiting who is just as disliked as the standard-bearer but is also exactly as irreplaceable. Harris is the most scrutinized vice-president in memory, and those around her have no doubt her coverage has been heavily warped by sexism and racism. Viewed from the most sympathetic perspective, the Harris who emerged as the administration\u2019s foremost advocate of abortion rights this summer has hit her stride. She\u2019s sat for high-profile interviews and condemned Republicans in speeches. She\u2019s met with state legislators facing the most immediate threats, as in Indiana and Florida, and campaigned in states where the midterms will determine the fate of legal abortion, as in Pennsylvania. Her role now resembles one Biden envisioned for her in the summer of 2020 \u2014 aggressive partisan warrior selling the administration\u2019s popular line. But that was a different political universe, and it took one and a half uncomfortable years for her set of skills to align with the administration\u2019s strategic needs. Harris set up her office with the instruction that maintaining close ties to the president was a priority, believing that to be a guarantee of internal influence. That proved unexpectedly complex, partly owing to their different operating styles. Whereas Biden has been surrounded by a core of the same staffers for decades, Harris\u2019s office has seen enough turnover to make it a much-whispered-about story line in Washington and beyond. She has replaced her chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, communications director, spokeswoman, national security adviser, and speechwriter (twice), and her longest-serving senior aide, domestic-policy adviser Rohini Kosoglu, will depart this summer. Though Biden and Harris get along and meet regularly, it is rarely in the kind of one-on-one setting like the lunches that famously formed the cornerstone of Biden\u2019s relationship with Barack Obama. Harris has leaned on a rotating group of outside counselors. This includes some elected officials, such as Representative Barbara Lee, and others in the administration, such as Housing Secretary Marcia Fudge, but also longtime party operatives including Minyon Moore, the Reverend Leah Daughtry, and EMILY\u2019s List leader Laphonza Butler as well as \u2014 occasionally \u2014 Hollywood power agent Bryan Lourd. She has also kept in sporadic touch with Hillary Clinton. But Harris\u2019s sister, policy expert Maya Harris, is known to be her closest confidante, though she has no formal role in the White House. The vice-president\u2019s thankless portfolio is more to blame for her slip in political traction than staff turnover. Her popularity started sinking when she first visited Central America and appeared dismissive of a suggestion that she visit the border. Behind the scenes, she was worried the assignment to take on the migrant crisis was a clear political loser. When critics latched on to her admonition to would-be migrants \u2014 \u201cDo not come\u201d \u2014 her frustration grew, as this was the administration line. Later, she remained silent at a tense meeting with Biden, letting other officials speak when he asked for updates. Afterward, she told aides to underscore that she was focused on the origins of migration, not the border itself. Her other top priority \u2014 voting rights \u2014 was no less publicly frustrating when the administration\u2019s preferred legislation predictably failed in the split Senate. Some close to her wonder why she didn\u2019t muscle her way into leading more popular projects: implementation of the COVID-relief-bill spending or, later, the infrastructure package. Most exasperating to her advocates, however, have been the questions about her preparedness for the top job, an especially sensitive line of inquiry ever since the 79-year-old Biden contracted COVID earlier in July. The concern comes mostly from her occasionally stumbling responses to journalists. She told a CBS interviewer who asked if Democrats had erred in not codifying Roe v. Wade into law, \u201cI think that, to be very honest with you, I \u2014 I do believe that we should have rightly believed, but we certainly believe, that certain issues are just settled. Certain issues are just settled.\u201d It was one genuinely cringeworthy moment in a straightforward interview, but it was shared far and wide, especially on the left. \u201cOften Democrats are their own worst fucking enemies,\u201d said Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher. \u201cDemocrats will stab each other up at the drop of a dime.\u201d None of it has dimmed the confidence of Harris\u2019s closest aides that she can regain her political footing by traveling more, and her new staff has suggested she take advantage of interviews with celebrities and influencers to reach nonpolitically focused audiences. Plenty of supporters also believe the administration would be in worse shape if not for her sustained popularity with Black women in particular \u2014 Democrats\u2019 most reliable voting base and the group that won Biden the nomination in 2020. Belcher recently found that this group gave Harris a \u201cthermometer rating\u201d in the 70s, meaning they viewed her far more warmly than most politicians. A Fox News poll had her overall approval rating just below 40 percent but as high as 65 percent among Black voters. Top party donors have privately worried to close Obama allies that they\u2019re skeptical of Harris\u2019s prospects as a presidential candidate, citing the implosion of her 2020 campaign and her struggles as VP. Jockeying from other potential competitors, like frenemy Gavin Newsom, suggests that few would defer to her if Biden retired. Yet Harris\u2019s strength among the party\u2019s most influential voters nonetheless puts her in clear pole position. Harris is careful not to be seen as overtly angling for the presidency. But it was no coincidence that this summer she visited the early-voting and often decisive state of South Carolina, in which Black voters make up most of the primary electorate. For now, anything beyond her role as a booster for Biden is moot while the president clings to the notion that only he can beat Trump and that he therefore must run again. But that posture may be sustainable for only so long. Just hours after the New Hampshire poll dropped, the cloud over the White House darkened further. A new CNN survey found the number of Democrats prepared to turn the page on Biden had risen. Now it\u2019s three out of every four.

SNAP provides food-purchasing assistance to low-income households. If you are eligible for SNAP benefits, they will be deposited monthly into your SNAP account. Payments are now made with Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards instead of food stamps, although some states might have a different name for the cards. EBT cards are linked to SNAP accounts. Cards can be swiped at checkout in grocery stores, major retailers and other outlets, similar to debit cards. You will need to enter your PIN to complete the transaction. Depending on your state, you might also be able to purchase eligible foods online at participating retailers. Visit the USDA page to see which retailers accept online EBT payments. To find out when you\u2019ll receive your January 2023 payment, the USDA provides information on monthly payment schedules for all states and territories. In most states, payment dates are staggered throughout the month based on SNAP case numbers, last names or Social Security numbers. The payment schedule is usually the same every month. In very rare cases, all recipients get payments on the same date, such as in Alaska, which makes SNAP benefits available on the first day of every month for all recipients. In more populous states like Florida, benefits might be paid on 20 different days. States also have different rules regarding payment days that fall on weekends or holidays.

In most states, you also can\u2019t buy hot meals. The exceptions are states that have signed up for the SNAP Restaurant Meals Program, including Alaska, California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Rhode Island and Virginia. You can apply for SNAP through your state\u2019s local SNAP office or on its website. You can also visit SNAP\u2019s Application and Local Office Locators page to learn how to apply in your state. To get SNAP benefits, you must apply in the state in which you currently reside and you must meet certain requirements, including resource and income limits. Depending on your state, there may be additional requirements. You can also apply for SNAP at the same time you apply for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). As previously reported by GOBankingRates, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will now notify SSI applicants and recipients of their eligibility for SNAP. When a household applies for or receives SSI, the agency will also help them apply for SNAP. \n See: Social Security and USDA Strengthen Partnership To Aid SNAP and SSI RecipientsFind: 30 States Extended Emergency SNAP Allotment Through December 2022 To locate nearby SNAP-authorized offices, use the SNAP Retailer Locator tool.

But, in the months after Harris took office her leadership began to suffer. Reports soon emerged of a string of departures from key staff members and press coverage indicated the new VP was a demanding boss struggling to handle her political portfolio. \u201cExasperation and dysfunction: Inside Kamala Harris\u2019 frustrating start as vice president\u201d read one CNN headline. \u201cKamala Harris: The absentee VP by design,\u201d wrote the online newspaper The Hill, which cited the leader\u2019s lack of solo press conferences and scant one-on-one interviews as evidence of her fading into the background. By her 11th month in office Harris\u2019 approval rating stood at 28% \u2014 10% below President Joe Biden. Dick Cheney approval rating, July 2007: 30 percent\nKamala Harris approval rating, November 2021: 27 percent \u2014 Gravel Institute (@GravelInstitute) November 14, 2021 However, while the public and media may have been dissatisfied with Harris\u2019 leadership, the vice president was doing exactly what was required of her, explained Amy Dacey, former CEO of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in an interview with DW. The US constitution outlines only two roles for a vice president: take over when a president is unable to serve, and preside over the US Senate. Everything else is an added duty. Harris plays key role as Senate tie-breaker As president of the Senate, the vice president is designated to cast tie-breaking votes in the event of split decisions in the body. After the 2020 election the body was split evenly, 50-50 Democrats to Republicans (that balance shifted as a result of the 2022 midterms in which Democrats won a slim majority). This meant that Harris\u2019 vote was key to the Biden administration\u2019s legislative wins. WATCH: VP Kamala Harris BREAK the 50-50 Senate vote to PASS the Inflation Reduction Act!\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc99pic.twitter.com/2QNjmly6OT \u2014 Peter Morley (@morethanmySLE) August 7, 2022 For example in August, Harris cast the tie-breaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, a federal law meant to fight inflation and promote domestic production. To date, she has acted as a tie-breaker 26 times \u2014 topped by only two other vice presidents in US history (John C. Calhoun, 31; and John Adams, 29). And, while Harris has presided over a divided US Senate on issues of pressing domestic and international importance, she has also been at the forefront of key diplomatic engagements abroad. Working to help restore US diplomacy abroad While the Trump administration adhered to an \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy, the Biden administration has sought to return to diplomacy and ensure America is \u201crespected around the world,\u201d explained Amy Dacey. Harris has been a key diplomatic actor since taking office, attending the Munich Security Conference (MSC), for instance, a yearly meeting critical to trans-Atlantic relations. Delivering the keynote speech at the February 2022 installment of the MSC, she was vocal in stressing the Biden administration\u2019s support for Ukraine. \u201cIf Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States, together with our allies and partners, will impose significant and unprecedented economic costs,\u201d Harris said. During her November visit to the Philippines, she underscored US support for the country in its territorial disputes with China. \u201cWe stand with you in defense of international rules and norms as it relates to the South China Sea,\u201d Harris told President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Respect for the VP\u2019s international engagement is reflected in confidence in her leadership abroad. In a recent Pew Research Center survey roughly 55% of adults in 18 countries said they had confidence in her. That figure is on par with international confidence in US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, according to the survey. However, as Harris has successfully served as a representative for the administration abroad, her domestic popularity has languished as she grapples with divisive tasks at home. Harris\u2019 difficult domestic responsibilities Migration is a divisive issue among US politicians and the public, one that has been described as \u201cperilous\u201d and a \u201cpolitical grenade\u201d by experts. Yet that is one of the portfolios that Harris has been entrusted with by the Biden administration. Her foremost task has been to deal with the influx of migration of people into the US through Mexico and Central America\u2019s Northern Triangle \u2014 made up of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. For her first foreign trip, Harris travelled to Guatemala and Mexico in June of 2021, saying she wanted to address the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration. I\u2019m here in Guatemala City for my first international trip as Vice President. I look forward to meeting with President @DrGiammattei and community leaders. pic.twitter.com/HHCWRt2zBi \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) June 7, 2021 \u201cI want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come. Do not come,\u201d said Harris in a press conference with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei. In response, US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a fellow Democrat, tweeted, \u201cThis is disappointing to see.\u201d This is disappointing to see. First, seeking asylum at any US border is a 100% legal method of arrival. Second, the US spent decades contributing to regime change and destabilization in Latin America. We can\u2019t help set someone\u2019s house on fire and then blame them for fleeing. https://t.co/vADyh5H0bw \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 7, 2021 Republican lawmakers complained that Harris had not gone straight to the US-Mexico border. This September, Texas Governor Greg Abbott sent two buses of around 100 migrants and asylum seekers to the VP\u2019s home. \u201cWe will continue sending migrants to sanctuary cities like DC until Pres. Biden & Border Czar Harris step up & do their jobs to secure the border,\u201d Abbott wrote on Twitter. Is Kamala Harris a failure or just misrepresented? While Harris has had to deal with challenging assignments, her leadership has been far from a failure, according to Amy Dacey, who suggests the pressure she faces from the public and fellow lawmakers may have less to do with job performance and more with who she is and how she is represented. Harris is dealing with the fact that she is both a minority and a woman in US politics. There are, for instance, no Black women currently serving in the US Senate, the very body she presides over. And politics in the US are also overwhelmingly male, especially in executive leadership \u2014 the United States has yet to elect a female president. This creates added difficulty for women trying to get into politics in the US. These \u201coften feel like they\u2019ve had to prove themselves in ways that men have not,\u201d explained Kelly Dittmar, an assistant research professor at Rutgers University\u2019s Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP) in an interview with DW. In 2020, Harris ran against Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primaries but dropped out of the race citing a lack of financial resources. Her exit had an added effect, according to Dittmer, who said Harris \u201csuffered from the perception that she was not ready, did not have the qualifications, was not electable as president.\u201d But running for office and losing is not at all unusual for those with presidential ambitions. Joe Biden ran for the office twice before being elected. He also served as vice president for eight years. Despite the wins and losses that have come with Harris\u2019 leadership, US politics do not happen in a vacuum. Each decision, engagement, and new legislation creates an incremental change even if the impact is not readily understood by the broader public, Amy Dacey explained. But these small wins often fall outside of Kamala Harris\u2019 main role as a vice president. A job that she may already be fulfilling. Oxford Bookstore Book Cover Prize Longlist announced   "], "https://snapon-industrial.co.uk/snap-on-tools/": [" Critical industries rely on the techs \u2013 and the tools \u2013 that get the job done. And that\u2019s why the world\u2019s best techs trust Snap-on tools. With a legacy of excellence, a commitment to a job well done and an unwavering work ethic, Snap-on tools live up to the highest standards: yours. For the critical, Snap-on is indispensable. Keeping the world moving isn\u2019t just your job. It\u2019s your purpose. In 1920, a cultural shift was underway in the United States as the automobile was rising in popularity, creating the need for an emerging automotive repair industry. Joseph Johnson, an engineer from Milwaukee, had an idea that would revolutionise repair and make work easier for professional mechanics. In 1923, Snap-on filed for its first patent, a ratcheting attachment. The No. 6 Ratchet was designed by Joseph Johnson and was the first ratcheting attachment made for use with the original set of interchangeable socket wrenches. In the grip of the Great Depression, Snap-on salesmen would say to their customers, \u201cEverybody is in a fix today \u2013 no money \u2013 but when you have money again, what tools will you need?\u201d They called these \u201cDream Orders.\u201d The novel idea quickly developed into a \u201cNeeds List,\u201d and is still used with success today. The early 1940s were marked by World War II and the military experienced severe tool shortages as a result. As a preferred supplier to the government, Snap-on was called into action, producing tools that kept air and ground equipment operating. Wartime demands also led to product innovations. Post-war America began an era of optimism and growth of the middle class. The baby boom created a surge in home construction and a departure from the city to the suburbs. \u00a0 Snap-on was well positioned to take advantage of this cultural shift; the dealer network continued to expand as a result of the fast developing auto repair industry and industrial sales accelerated as factories returned back to pre-war production. At this time, the aviation industry was making advancements in reducing space and weight by modifying fasteners, but was struggling with rounding of the fastener corners upon removal. The Navy sought Snap-on to solve this dilemma. \u00a0 The solution, called the Flank Drive\u00ae Wrenching System, was issued two patents in 1965 and proved so popular that it spread throughout the Snap-on product line. As Snap-on celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1970, it began a decade of explosive growth. The number and variety of products jumped 30% and capacity was added through plant expansions. \u00a0 For the decade, Snap-on net sales grew from $76.5 million in 1970 to $373.6 million in 1979. In the late 1980s, the \u201cSoaring to New Heights in Customer Service\u201d theme was created as the Corporation strived to reach the $1 billion sales milestone. \u00a0 The eagle, a powerful, regal bird known for fast and furious flight, was chosen as the symbol to guide the Company to even higher levels of quality and customer service. In 1987, the $1 billion sales goal was achieved. Throughout the 1990s, Snap-on continued to expand product lines globally to better serve professionals in critical industries. More than two dozen companies were acquired. \u00a0 With Sioux\u00ae and Williams\u00ae we extended our offering in power and hand tools for critical industries. In 1995 Snap-on purchased Eurotools, reaching professional tradesmen globally. In 1999, Snap-on acquired the Bahco\u00ae iconic brand. RCI is a structured set of tools and processes, used by associates globally to eliminate wasted effort and create productivity and quality, leading to sustainable operating efficiencies. \u00a0 Beginning in 2005, Snap-on enlisted the masters of the Toyota Production System, Shingijutsu, as a guide. Snap-on is positioned for the future with favorable vehicle population trends, increasing vehicle complexity, growing demand in emerging markets and significant opportunities in industries outside of vehicle repair. To capitalize on these opportunities, we are investing strategically in these wide runways for growth in order to reach more professionals.

As President, Biden will restore America\u2019s leadership and build our communities back better. Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the first of four children of Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden and Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr. In 1953, the Biden family moved to Claymont, Delaware. President Biden graduated from the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School and served on the New Castle County Council.\u00a0 At age 29, President Biden became one of the youngest people ever elected to the United States Senate. Just weeks after his Senate election, tragedy struck the Biden family when his wife Neilia and daughter Naomi were killed, and sons Hunter and Beau were critically injured, in an auto accident. Biden was sworn into the U.S. Senate at his sons\u2019 hospital bedsides and began commuting from Wilmington to Washington every day, first by car, and then by train, in order to be with his family. He would continue to do so throughout his time in the Senate.\u00a0 Biden married Jill Jacobs in 1977, and in 1980, their family was complete with the birth of Ashley Blazer Biden. A lifelong educator, Jill earned her doctorate in education and returned to teaching as an English professor at a community college in Virginia. Beau Biden, Attorney General of Delaware and Joe Biden\u2019s eldest son, passed away in 2015 after battling brain cancer with the same integrity, courage, and strength he demonstrated every day of his life. Beau\u2019s fight with cancer inspires the mission of President Biden\u2019s life \u2014 ending cancer as we know it. As a Senator from Delaware for 36 years, President Biden established himself as a leader in facing some of our nation\u2019s most important domestic and international challenges. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for 16 years, Biden is widely recognized for his work writing and spearheading the Violence Against Women Act\u00a0 \u2014 the landmark legislation that strengthens penalties for violence against women, creates unprecedented resources for survivors of assault, and changes the national dialogue on domestic and sexual assault. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years, Biden played a pivotal role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. He was at the forefront of issues and legislation related to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, post-Cold War Europe, the Middle East, Southwest Asia, and ending apartheid. \u201cAmerica is an idea. An idea that is stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It gives hope to the most desperate people on earth, it guarantees that everyone is treated with dignity and gives hate no safe harbor. It instills in every person in this country the belief that no matter where you start in life, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t achieve if you work at it. That\u2019s what we believe.\u201d As Vice President, Biden continued his leadership on important issues facing the nation and represented our country abroad. Vice President Biden convened sessions of the President\u2019s Cabinet, led interagency efforts, and worked with Congress in his fight to raise the living standards of middle-class Americans, reduce gun violence, address violence against women, and end cancer as we know it. Biden helped President Obama pass and then oversaw the implementation of the Recovery Act \u2014 the biggest economic recovery plan in the history of the nation and our biggest and strongest commitment to clean energy. The President\u2019s plan prevented another Great Depression, created and saved millions of jobs, and led to 75 uninterrupted months of job growth by the end of the administration. And Biden did it all with less than 1% in waste, abuse, or fraud \u2014 the most efficient government program in our country\u2019s history. President Obama and Vice President Biden also secured the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which reduced the number of uninsured Americans by 20 million by the time they left office and banned insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions. He served as the point person for U.S. diplomacy throughout the Western Hemisphere, strengthened relationships with our allies both in Europe and the Asia-Pacific, and led the effort to bring 150,000 troops home from Iraq. In a ceremony at the White House, President Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction \u2014 the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor. After leaving the White House, the Bidens continued their efforts to expand opportunity for every American with the creation of the Biden Foundation, the Biden Cancer Initiative, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, and the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware. On April 25, 2019, Biden announced his candidacy for President of the United States. Biden\u2019s candidacy was built from the beginning around 3 pillars: the battle for the soul of our nation, the need to rebuild our middle class \u2014 the backbone of our country, and a call for unity, to act as One America. It was a message that would only gain more resonance in 2020 as we confront a pandemic, an economic crisis, urgent calls for racial justice, and the existential threat of climate change. \u201cWe are living through a battle for the soul of this nation.\u201d We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \nThe White House\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWashington, DC 20500\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"], "https://www.whatdigitalcamera.com/technology_guides/aspherical-lens-element-works-60412": [" \n  In this article, we look at the aspherical lens element, providing a guide to what it is for, and how it works Aspherical lens element\t\t\t The aspherical lens element has helped to improve the optical quality of camera lenses in recent years. You may have seen \u2018Asph\u2019 or \u2018Aspheric\u2019 marked on a camera lens or in lens specifications. It\u2019s now widely regarded as a mark of excellence. In a perfect world, all lenses would work like a pinhole camera lens. This would mean there would be no distortion, and focus would be uniform across the frame. However, pinhole lenses are completely impractical because they are very dark and you can\u2019t use them to enjoy effects such as selective focus and blurring for creative effect. This is why a combination of glass lenses and lenses of other materials \u2013 including optical plastics \u2013 are used in modern camera lens designs. Lens elements, whether concave, convex etc, were originally composed of surfaces that represented part of a perfect sphere. The problem with this is that there are situations where such combinations of \u2018spherical\u2019 lenses can\u2019t project an image that is uniformly focused across the flat surface of the camera sensor or film plane. This is most apparent when using medium to wide apertures where the depth of focus (not to be confused with depth of field) is narrow. Aspherical lenses, where the curve of the lens element surface is no longer part of a perfect sphere, can be used to correct such focusing aberrations. Aspheric lenses result in sharper images, especially at wider apertures, and can also be designed to minimise other optical imperfections such as chromatic aberrations.

For those who don\u2019t know baseball, a softball question is one that is lobbed at slow speed in a predictable arc, enabling even a novice politician to \u201chit one out of the park.\u201d Whereas in T-ball, the ball (or question) is set up in a stationary position on top of a waist-high pipe, where the batter can approach at his or her leisure and try to make contact.  Left wing pundit, George Stephanopoulos, a major practitioner of the slow pitch school of political journalism, has been ridiculed by jealous competitors for asking Harris Miss-America-Beauty-contest-style questions like: \u201cWe all know that President Biden appointed you the so-called Border Tsar. But what we don\u2019t know is whether you spell it T-s-a-r or C-z-a-r.\u201d Surprisingly, despite his best fawning slo-pitch questions, Mr. Stephanopoulos was recently told by Ms. Harris\u2019s team that he has nevertheless been too hard on her, as judged by her negative reviews in the wake of his interviews. Consequently, they explained, Ms. Harris would be spending time in the new T-ball league of Vice Presidential journalism and would no longer be available to him.  When Stephanopoulos objected, demanding to know the difference between a softball question and a T-ball question, he was told that in the latter interview format, Ms. Harris would be given the questions in advance and time to practice an answer; or, alternatively, that questions would be posed as multiple-choice options, with the correct answer always being \u201cB.\u201d And of course, after every interview an award or trophy or other award of some kind must be immediately presented to her. \u201cThis is absurd,\u201d Stephanopoulos complained, according to leaks from someone on the VP\u2019s staff who participated in the meeting.  \u201cPlease, George, work with us here,\u201d the staffer said, in tears. \u201cThis woman is a monster. She couldn\u2019t even have a spontaneous discussion with six-year-olds about space exploration without hiring child actors and giving them scripts. What the hell do you want us to do?\u201d According to the leaked notes of the conversation Stephanopoulos reluctantly agreed, \u201cYes, I see your point now. If we let her strike out every time at bat, it reflects badly on all that diversity is our strength stuff.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it, you got it. It\u2019s T-ball time for Kamala from now on.\u201d \u201cBut you know that can\u2019t last. You\u2019ve got to coach her the hell up. You can\u2019t have both Joe and Kamala hiding in the White House basement electrical closet until 2024. Someone will notice that the lights are out and no one\u2019s home.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, George. We\u2019ve got a plan B. If it comes to that, we\u2019ll just put the White House up on Airbnb. Apparently, Hillary is looking for a vacation from obscurity.\u201d \u201cOK. But just in case, maybe Hillary should start working on the T-ball thing too. That \u201cdeplorables\u201d rant was a huge swing and miss.\u201d \u201cLove you.\u201d The funny story above is a satire or parody. It is entirely fictitious.

Maxine Waters, and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, have achieved elevated engagement and influence among voters. Online movements and social justice campaigns such as #BlackLivesMatters, #OscarsSoWhite, and #SayHerName have created resistive counternarratives that challenge the dominant, mainstream media. With the Black community making up the largest population of social media users, Twitter, specifically \u201cBlack Twitter,\u201d has turned into an online space of interconnection within the Black community to discuss trending topics or issues. By examining how Vice President Kamala Harris (who was the vice-presidential nominee at the time of the study) used Twitter as a social media platform to achieve political prominence, researchers at the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications created a lens through which future researchers and the public may better understand the redefinition of Black women in both social media and politics, as well as understand the broader issue of oppression among all marginalized, less mainstream communities. While social media influencers \u2013 those who affect the decisions of others due to their authority, knowledge, position, or relationship to an audience \u2013 tend to be related more to brand evangelism or financial exchange, Kamala Harris\u2019 use of Twitter throughout the 2020 presidential campaign led to her current position as a social, cultural, and political influencer. For this study, Harris\u2019 tweets along with users\u2019 comments were collected and organized into narrative forms, and then analyzed for narrative themes. Criteria included semantics, syntax, and particular textual elements such as quotations and metaphors, as well as the relationship of these elements to each other. The goal of this study was to examine the ways in which popular commentary on Black women\u2019s lives, using Kamala Harris as a representative example, can be analyzed to challenge the focus on single-identity reporting in mainstream media. Three themes emerged: Change: Frequent topics for Harris include gun violence, Donald Trump, COVID-19, and the Black Lives Matter movement. Throughout the tweets, Harris emphasizes how change is possible, consistently using \u201cwe\u201d over \u201cI\u201d to emphasize that involvement in community is the base of change. Access: Harris used Twitter to acknowledge the barriers to marginalized communities, such as access to exercise the right to vote. She also tweeted about how oppression and discrimination are institutionalized and systemic. Creating opportunities and resources is a frequent theme of her tweets, as is calling out systems of power that disenfranchise marginalized communities. Community: Harris often references her heritage, including mentions of her alma mater \u2013 Howard University \u2013 an Historically Black College and University (HBCU); her family, specifically her mother and sister; her South Asian heritage; and her connection to Black womanhood as a member of the nation\u2019s first and oldest Black sorority \u2013 Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. By emphasizing Black womanhood in these ways, Harris effectively creates a space for agency for the Black community, as well as a familial sense of activism. Instead of making herself the focal point, she draws the focus to the community-building of others through her own achievements. Overall, this study shows how Black women influencers are mobilizing social media to engage in counternarratives, as well as creating online spaces for ongoing media discourse. The activism and advocacy demonstrated by Harris via Twitter highlight the complex and ongoing oppression and discrimination in social, political, and economic systems and institutions. By conducting this study, the researchers hope to provide a framework for future advocacy and social change. The original research, \u201c\u2018I Am Speaking.\u2019 2020 VP Nominee Kamala Harris\u2019 Impact of Black Feminism as Social Influencers on Twitter,\u201d will be presented at the International Communications Association in May 2021.

Kamala Harris' popularity is dwindling with the public and her party. Is she a victim of Joe Biden\u2019s failures or responsible for her own misfortune? By\n                    Sarah Baxter  This article was originally published on 8 June 2022. It has been republished in light of Kamala Harris attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit on 18 November in Bangkok, Thailand. Many people had a crush on \u00adKamala Harris at her inauguration as vice-president of the United States in January 2021. There was more excitement about her \u00adpolitical rise than there was for the old \u00adwarhorse Joe Biden. She looked resplendent in purple, the colour of the suffragettes. Defined as ambitious and power-hungry \u2013 even by friends of Biden \u2013 she had not only\u00a0made history as the first \u00adfemale vice-president, but also as the first black and south Asian person to be elected to the position. She had fought hard for her place on the podium. Harris must have hoped then that she had been through the worst. \u201cWhen we talk about breaking barriers some would suggest that you\u2019re just on this side of the barrier and then you turn out on this side of the barrier. No, it\u2019s breaking barriers,\u201d she said during the 2020 election campaign. \u201cWhen you break things, it hurts. Sometimes you can get cut and it can be painful\u2026 but it is so worth it.\u201d Does anybody doubt the pain and hurt she has experienced since becoming vice-president after her competence and intellect have been endlessly pilloried? After her smile and laugh have been turned into an insult \u2013 dubbed the \u201cKamala cackle\u201d by the right-wing press, as though she were a witch \u2013 and her approval rating (roughly 40 per cent) remains stubbornly below that of Biden and Donald Trump? Related During the vice-presidential election debate on 7 October 2020, I enjoyed watching her put down the robotic Mike Pence. \u201cMr Vice-President, I\u2019m speaking,\u201d she said firmly, whenever he tried to talk over her. Yet has Harris ever had anything material to say in the job? She has plenty of defenders, who point to the revolting barrage of sexist and racist abuse she has received, but perilously few supporters. To what extent is she responsible for her own misfortune? The \u201cKamala problem\u201d is a fissure running through the Democratic Party. At 79, Biden needs a younger, more exciting heir apparent \u2013 that much was already clear when he made Harris his running mate \u2013 yet there remains a vacancy. Or worse: the Democrats are stuck with her or the ageing Biden in 2024. And it is not as though the party is bursting with lower-tier candidates who could invigorate the political scene if only Harris were not inconveniently blocking their way. [See also: What will Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential bid mean for American democracy?] There is bewilderment among many in the Democratic Party that having been tapped as next-in-line for the presidency, Harris has given every impression of feeling put upon and disrespected. An early point of contention was her dislike of her US Vogue magazine cover in January 2021, in which she was photographed wearing Converse trainers. She felt it made her look underpowered. \u201cFirst world problems,\u201d Biden advisers reportedly sighed. More recently, the vice-president\u2019s staffers have complained that Harris could be making more exciting political moves were she not stuck at the evenly divided Senate casting tie-breaking votes as vice-president. True, Harris exudes busyness without purpose, though her constitutional role in the Senate is no minor task. Yet even the greater responsibilities seem to chafe. From the beginning of her term in office, Harris bristled at being given the \u00addifficult job by Biden of addressing illegal immigration at the US-Mexico border. She insisted that she would only deal with the \u201croot causes\u201d of the problem. She spent months resisting intense pressure, first from Republicans and then from the media, to visit the border early on in her vice-presidency. When she eventually went to Guatemala in June 2021, her message to migrants was merely a bald: \u201cDo not come.\u201d \u201cShe has done a lot to try to make people forget she was ever involved in the issue,\u201d said David Bier, an associate director of \u00adimmigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank based in Washington DC. \u201cHer strategy has been to distance \u00adherself from it rather than to embrace it and come up with a message that would resonate with people. You get the sense that she has given up.\u201d Last summer in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, the talk at dinner parties frequented by the political elite was often about how to help Harris out of the mire. Her staff were already leaving at a vertiginous rate. Today, those anxious questions from supporters of how they can help the vice-president have given way to silence and eye-rolls. \u201cNo vice-president since Dan Quayle has made less of an impact in their first year of office than Harris,\u201d said a veteran of Democratic political campaigns. \u201cWe are now at the point that you can talk about politics for hours without her name coming up.\u201d [See also: Nixon in China: the complicated legacy of a week that changed the world] Is it too late to reboot Harris\u2019s profile? In 2008 the New Yorker depicted Michelle Obama dressed in camouflage gear and toting a gun in a racist caricature. She went on to become one of the most admired first ladies in US history. Unlike Harris, \u00adhowever, Obama was not perceived as a potential president-in-waiting, a role that has made the vice-president vulnerable. Harris recently received an unexpected boost in support when on 2 May a leaked Supreme Court document showed a draft opinion that would overturn Roe vs Wade \u2013 the 1973 case that ruled a woman\u2019s right to \u00adterminate a pregnancy was protected by the US constitution. Here at last, perhaps, was a battle that could galvanise her vice-presidency. \u201cHow dare they tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her own body,\u201d she thundered the following day in a speech at a gala for the feminist group Emily\u2019s List. \u201cHow dare they try to stop her from determining her own future? How dare they try to deny women their rights and freedoms?\u201d By the end of the week, however, Harris had adopted Biden\u2019s more measured line that the end of Roe vs Wade posed a threat to broader privacy laws, such as \u201cthe right to use contraception and the right to marry the person you love, including a member of the same sex\u201d \u2013 as if the restriction of abortion was not enough of an outrage in itself. Rachel Bitecofer, a political strategist and polling analyst, blames Democratic consultants for wringing the spontaneity and authenticity out of Harris. \u201cThey\u2019re doing to her what they did to Hillary Clinton, which is \u2018Don\u2019t say this\u2019, \u2018Don\u2019t say that\u2019, \u2018Don\u2019t do this\u2019 \u2013 and it\u2019s making her afraid to say anything,\u201d Bitecofer said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re cautious, you\u2019re not personable.\u201d Trump fanatics no longer care to include Harris in their bonkers conspiracy theories, a sure sign of the vice-president\u2019s diminishing influence. Not that there aren\u2019t racist lines of attack waiting to be used by the right in the event that she runs for president. John Eastman, a constitutional lawyer who was in communication with Trump on the ways to block Biden\u2019s presidential victory certification in January 2021, said in December last year: \u201cWhether Kamala Harris was automatically a citizen at birth because she was born on US soil to parents who were only temporary visitors at the time remains an open issue that the Supreme Court has not resolved.\u201d In fact, Harris was born in California in 1964 and is therefore a \u201cnatural-born citizen\u201d according to the US constitution, whatever the status of her mother and father, who came to the United States (from India and Jamaica, respectively) to pursue doctorates at the University of California, Berkeley. But we have not heard the last of this new-fangled birtherism. One of the more persistent political conspiracy theories in 2020 centred on how Harris, with the support of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, was going to invoke the 25th amendment,\u00a0 declare Biden senile and remove him from the White House at the earliest opportunity. I first heard about this supposed plot before the 2020 election at a gun shop in a hardscrabble town in Pennsylvania. Residents of the town had voted Democrat for generations until Trump came along. The couple behind the till were convinced Harris\u2019s first act as president would be to ban the sale of weapons. In the run-up to the 2020 election, Harris was regarded as a dangerous threat that needed to be neutralised. In this, the Republicans have thoroughly succeeded. After two horrific mass shootings in May \u2013 one targeting black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, and the other children at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas \u2013 Harris said the solution was clear: more background checks and a ban on assault weapons.\u00a0 \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d she told residents in Buffalo on 28 May after attending the \u00adfuneral of the shooting\u2019s oldest victim, 86-year-old Ruth Whitfield. \u201cAn assault weapon is a weapon of war, with no place in a civil \u00adsociety.\u201d Yet without a majority in Congress for gun control \u2013 which the Democrats do not have \u2013 no one believes her words will have much impact. I\u00a0returned to the gun store in Pennsylvania\u00a0 in May to find the same couple still \u00adobsessing about the \u201cstolen\u201d election, but supremely indifferent about Harris. \u201cAs bad as Biden is, Harris is worse,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAt least Biden has an excuse. He sounds like he\u2019s on the verge of dementia. What about her \u2018word salads\u2019?\u201d This is a \u00adfamiliar Republican jibe drawn from social media videos of Harris\u2019s speeches, which, when maliciously edited, make her sound repetitive and idiotic. Unedited, however, she can still sound as if she is trying very hard to say nothing. The Biden team bears some of the blame for limiting the vice-president. There is no love lost between Harris and Jill Biden, the other powerful woman in the White House. An early account of the 2020 presidential race by the journalist Edward-Isaac Dovere claimed that during the primary campaign, the first lady swore in response to Harris\u2019s criticism of her husband\u2019s record on race. That hostility has been underscored by reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns in their new book, This Will Not Pass. \u201cThere are millions of people in the \u00adUnited States,\u201d Jill Biden reportedly said when Biden\u2019s team was considering Harris as vice-president. \u201cWhy do we have to choose the one who attacked Joe?\u201d It is reported in Washington circles that Biden wanted to pick the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar for his running mate \u2013 with Harris primed for the first Supreme Court vacancy. Yet, the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 made the appointment of a black vice-presidential candidate a matter of urgency. According to Martin and Burns, Ron Klain, now Biden\u2019s chief of staff, picked Harris because she was the only woman of colour who had been sufficiently \u201cvetted\u201d. Harris\u2019s election campaign team and vice-presidential office were originally staffed by mostly Biden appointees (allegedly Harris\u00a0 clashed with Karine Jean-Pierre, who last month became the first black White House press secretary). It is reported that across the White House as many as 21 black employees have either left or are expected to leave in the coming weeks, including some frustrated at their lack of support and opportunities for promotion under Biden. Biden himself \u2013 with an eye to running again in 2024 \u2013 has had a vested interest in sidelining his vice-president. Symone Sanders, Harris\u2019s former chief spokesperson, who quit the vice-president\u2019s office in December 2021 to join MSNBC, told a New York Times podcast: \u201cThe reality is that the \u00adpresident has said he intends to run for \u00adre-election.\u201d She added that if he wanted to stand again, \u201che should\u201d. Biden needs no encouragement. What began as a wish to run for a second term has hardened into the conviction that only he is capable of defeating Trump (still the most likely Republican candidate) in 2024. But if Biden were not to run, Sanders observed: \u201cI find it very hard to believe that he is not going to endorse his vice-president, the first black woman to have that role.\u201d [See also: The coming Republican civil war] Sanders sounded distinctly cool about the prospect of a Harris presidency, but she was right that her former boss would expect to have Biden\u2019s loyalty. Whether Harris would receive his endorsement as his successor is moot. There is a chance Biden could opt to play the \u201celder statesman\u201d and refrain from making a choice. More likely, Harris is here to stay as vice-president. There is no chance that Biden would be able to replace Harris with another running mate in 2024 without her agreement. The public insult to such a historic vice-president would be too grave. And even if a dynamic new presidential contender were to emerge \u2013 a somewhat fanciful prospect \u2013 it would be difficult to sweep Harris aside. There is no sign of diminishing ambition on her part. Quite the contrary. Harris\u2019s husband, Doug Emhoff, a former Californian entertainment lawyer, is an active member of her team (eliciting quite a few raised eyebrows at the number of press releases the \u201cOffice of the Second Gentleman\u201d churns out). He was recently at a \u201cfireside conversation\u201d for lawyers in New Hampshire, an early primary state. Coincidence? It is hard to say at this stage. For all her public struggles, polling among black voters suggests Harris would be hard to beat, particularly given the importance of South Carolina in the Democratic primary calendar. According to a Politico/Morning Consult poll in December 2021, if Biden didn\u2019t run 52 per cent of black voters would support Harris in a 2024 primary. In April, a survey by Republican pollsters, Echelon Insights, put Harris\u2019s support among black voters at 53 per cent. It was this vital electorate that propelled Biden to the presidential nomination in 2020. Cornell Belcher, the author of A Black Man in the House, told Politico that even Barack Obama did not poll this well with black voters during his battle with Hillary Clinton for the 2008 presidential nomination. \u201cIt is clear that the work she\u2019s been doing is beginning to give her credibility and likeability with African-American voters in a way that no one else in the field has right now.\u201d Despite this, however, a number of rivals are rumoured to be considering running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2024, such as Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, who has been whispered to be the \u201canti-woke\u201d candidate (though critics claim that he will need to get the city\u2019s spiralling crime rates under control first to stand a chance). Progressives would like the popular New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or the liberal Californian \u00adcongressman Ro Khanna to run for president \u2013 and even Bernie Sanders thinks he still has a chance. On 16 April, in a list of the top ten Democratic presidential candidates for 2024, the Washington Post provocatively ranked Pete Buttigieg, who is serving as secretary of state for transport, second \u00adbehind Biden but ahead of third-placed \u00adHarris. This ranking will have stung the vice-president, given \u00adButtigieg\u2019s low ratings among black voters (3 per cent in the \u00adPolitico/Morning Consult poll). Other potential nominees include Cory Booker, the senator for New Jersey, and Klobuchar (both of whom have run for president before) and Gavin Newsom, the slick, wealthy governor of California. [See also: Joe Biden shouldn\u2019t run in 2024] There is surprisingly little fondness for Harris in her home state of California. She gained a reputation for flip-flopping over the death penalty as a prosecutor turned politician in San Francisco, and was criticised during her campaign for the 2020 presidency for lacking a distinctive political philosophy. One reason she left the race early, in December 2019, is that she was heading for an embarrassing defeat by Bernie Sanders in California on Super Tuesday. Previously, Harris has been accused of managing a deeply dysfunctional vice-presidential office. Relations with her own staff were memorably described last year as a \u201cshit show\u201d, and they have not greatly improved since. In the past three months, her chief of staff, deputy chief of staff and national security adviser have all announced their departures. Some regard the criticism aimed at Harris as just another example of sexism. \u201cDo you think all men are good bosses? We never hear anything about them,\u201d said Bitecofer. \u201cThe treatment of Harris as aloof reinforces \u00adRepublican narratives,\u201d she added. Harris, however, has not been able to reverse this perception. Symone Sanders recently answered \u00addiplomatically when asked about the internal strains within the vice-president\u2019s team. She said: \u201c[Harris] is a boss that asks people to bring their best to work every day.\u201d Perhaps the most \u00adeffective way to assess Harris is to pose the same question. Is she bringing her best to work every day? If so, the prospects look poor for the Democratic Party post-Biden. The late Republican senator John McCain once said that one of the main duties of the vice-president was to enquire daily as to the health of the president. Most Democrats are fervently hoping that a more popular \u00adsuccessor to Joe Biden \u2013 one capable of taking on Trump in 2024 \u2013 will emerge. This may be wishful thinking. The Kamala problem is here to stay.

Trying to get her to take a few questions after events is treated as an act of impish aggression,\u201d writes Edward-Isaac Dovere. \u201cAnd Harris herself tracks political players and reporters whom she thinks don\u2019t fully understand her or appreciate her life experience.\u201d She\u2019s hyper-sensitive and not very smart, according to the profile. Washington Free Beacon: According to Dovere\u2019s reporting, Harris judiciously monitors the words journalists use to describe her. \u201cShe particularly doesn\u2019t like the word cautious, and aides look out for synonyms too,\u201d he writes. \u201cCareful, guarded, and hesitant don\u2019t go over well.\u201d Antonyms as well, apparently. During the 2020 campaign, journalists and other libs were sounding the alarm about the word \u201cambitious.\u201d This was especially true following reports that some aides to then-candidate Joe Biden thought Harris was\u00a0too ambitious\u00a0to be his running mate; Biden did \u201cnot want to be outshone.\u201d Rep. Karen Bass (D., Calif.) was reportedly considered because, unlike Harris, she had no interest in running for president in the future. Andrew Stiles finds similarities between Harris and Hillary Clinton. Some aides have been \u201csurprised at how much work there is to be done\u201d when it comes to educating Harris on policy issues.\u00a0Even journalists have grown tired of the VP\u2019s tendency to \u201cretreat behind talking points and platitudes in public.\u201d\u00a0Dovere writes that, at times, Harris \u201ccomes\u00a0off as so uninteresting that television producers have started to wonder whether spending thousands of dollars to send people on trips with her is worthwhile, given how little usable material they get out of it.\u201d In many ways, Harris is merely a non-white version of Hillary Clinton. Both women are possessed by ruthless ambition, yet lack the necessary skills to succeed in politics at the national level. They are most comfortable when regurgitating talking points and platitudes. Objectively speaking, they share a knack for unsettling\u00a0laughter\u00a0and launched their political careers by dating\u00a0powerful men. When Joe Biden said during the campaign that he would choose a woman of color to be his running mate, he immediately narrowed the list of candidates to a handful. He got stuck with Harris largely for two reasons: her radicalism could be easily masked and she was the most successful woman of color who had held office. Harris was once seen as a fierce advocate for law and order and angered minority groups for backing policies they hated. To Joe Biden\u2019s mind, that made her a \u201cmoderate.\u201d Whatever \u201cmoderate\u201d policies she may have backed in the past, she now fully embraces Biden\u2019s radical agenda. That she keeps an enemies list isn\u2019t surprising. Many politicians who lack the thick skin necessary to compete at the national level keep them. It\u2019s what they do with the list that matters if they ever achieve power. Rick Moran has been writing for PJ Media for 13 years.

However, you should try to maintain an updated list in your personal files\n                                    so that you keep an accurate record of your college activities for future use and\n                                    for easy retrieval and transfer. The purpose of such a list is to give the scholarship committee a greater sense of\n                                    your achievements, experiences, and personal interests. Typically, your List of Honors is meant to showcase your research accomplishments\n                                    and publications as well as your community service and leadership experiences. Write your list according to the particular attributes of the scholarship for which\n                                    you are applying. Specific guidelines will be provided to you when you start your\n                                    online application, so make sure you follow them. If a scholarship (such as the Truman) is looking for leadership potential, be sure your list highlights your leadership\n                                    experience and community service accurately. For example, the Rhodes seeks candidates that are academically exceptional, but also well rounded in other\n                                    ways, such as extra curricular activities. Therefore, it is appropriate, in that case,\n                                    to include athletic and extracurricular activities in addition to your academic honors\n                                    and awards. As you create your list, don\u2019t assume that your readers know anything about the particular\n                                    organizations or types of honors you are listing. Identify each item as succinctly\n                                    as possible, including the nature of the organization and what you have specifically\n                                    accomplished, as well as any recognition you may have received. Avoid acronyms unless\n                                    they refer to commonly known and easily recognized organizations. Think carefully about the relevance and importance of the honors, awards and activities\n                                    you include in your list. Try not to populate it with items whose relevance may seem\n                                    dubious or whose importance may appear questionable. Make sure the links to articles\n                                    you published (or contributed to) in electronic journals, organizations whose membership\n                                    you claim, websites you created or maintain, portfolios of your creative/professional\n                                    work, etc., are active and correct. The last thing you want is someone clicking on\n                                    a web address you included in your list and be shown an error message or not find\n                                    any mention of you or your work in the website. That will create doubts regarding\n                                    your honesty or diligence, and may impact your chances to advance in the competition\n                                    or affect the outcome of a personal interview. Most scholarships will ask you to enter specific information on an electronic template,\n                                    but for those that don\u2019t (such as the Rhodes), lists that are well organized and carefully\n                                    constructed will make a more favorable impression on the scholarship committee that\n                                    evaluates your application. Categorize your List of Honors by headings like \u201cAcademics,\u201d\n                                    \u201cCommunity Service,\u201d and so forth, in a clear and coherent manner. Aim for conciseness\n                                    and clarity when creating your list. Don\u2019t clutter it with items of little importance\n                                    or indirect relevance to the mission, goals and objectives of the scholarship or to\n                                    your proposed program of study. \n                                    UAA is a comprehensive, open access, public university established on the ancestral\n                                    homelands of the Dena\u2019ina, Ahtna, Alutiiq/Sugpiaq, and Eyak/dAXunhyuu Peoples.\n                                    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                  \n            \u00a9 2021 University of Alaska Anchorage UA is an AA/EO employer and educational institution and prohibits illegal discrimination against any individual.

Biden\n\n\n Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. (November 20, 1942) is the 46th President of the United States. He was the former 47th Vice President of the United States, a Senator of Delaware, Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Chair of the International Narcotics Control Caucus, Member of the New Castle County Council and a Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n \n Joseph Biden was born on November 20, 1942 to Joseph Biden Sr. and Catherine Finnegan. He is the oldest of four siblings; Valerie, Francis, and James.\n Biden was declared the winner on January 7, 2021.\n In order to protect his inauguration on January 20, 2021, Biden ordered around 25,000 national guard members within Washington D.C. These national guard members were vetted for political affiliation and removed some who supported Donald Trump for fear of an inside attack. Since there was no space, they were forced to remain in a parking garage. \n This created some backlash among Republicans and Trump gave permission for any National Guard member to reside in his hotels and some Governors such as Ronald DeSantis of Florida and Charles Baker of Massachusetts have withdrawn their national guard.\n Biden put a hold on further construction of the US-Mexico Border Wall and ordered that any illegal immigrants caught trying to pass over the border of Mexico be released immediately. He also has plans to give 11 Million illegal immigrants amnesty. These policies could lead to many economic strains as many Americans who would be looking for work could likely lose the position as the mass influx of immigrants can cause companies to begin to hire them over the working class Americans. His suspension of creating the border wall also cost around 11,000 jobs.\n The day Biden took office, he signed an executive order which mandated that every person on federal property be required to wear a face mask (Something which he violated a few hours later after being recorded not wearing a mask on federal property). Biden also initiated plans to rejoin the World Health Organization. There may also be plans to shut down travel to the United States from foreign countries, a plan that Biden condemned Trump for during the Trump Administration. It has been recently reported that what could be up to 20 Million vaccines have been lost.\n Biden suspended construction of the Keystone Pipeline and put an end to drilling for oil or natural gases on federal lands.

First president George Washington, who detested the very idea of partisan politics, belonged to no party. John Adams, our second president was a Federalist, America\u2019s first political party. Third, through sixth presidents, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, and John Quincy Adams were all members of the Democratic-Republican Party, which later splintered to become the modern Democratic Party and the Whig Party.\u00a0\n \nElected in 1828 and again in 1832, War of 1812 general and seventh President Andrew Jackson served two terms lasting from 1829 to 1837.\n \nTrue to the philosophy of the new Democratic Party, Jackson advocated protecting \u201cnatural rights\u201d against the attacks of a \u201ccorrupt aristocracy.\u201d With distrust of sovereign rule still running hot, this platform appealed to the American people who swept him to a landslide victory in 1828 over incumbent President John Quincy Adams.\u00a0\n \nElected in 1836, eighth President Martin Van Buren served from 1837 to 1841.\n \nVan Buren won the presidency largely by promising to continue the popular policies of his predecessor and political ally Andrew Jackson. When the public blamed his domestic policies for the financial Panic of 1837, Van Buren failed to be elected to a second term in 1840. During the campaign, newspapers hostile to his presidency referred to him as \u201cMartin Van Ruin.\u201d\u00a0\n \nEleventh President James K. Polk served one term from 1845 to 1849. An advocate of Andrew Jackson\u2019s \u201ccommon man\u201d democracy, Polk remains the only president to have served as Speaker of the House.\n \nThough considered a dark-horse in the 1844 election, Polk defeated Whig Party candidate Henry Clay in a nasty campaign. Polk\u2019s support for U.S. annexation of the Republic of Texas, considered a key to western expansion and Manifest Destiny, proved popular with voters.\n \nServing a single term, from 1853 to 1857, 14th President Franklin Pierce was a Northern Democrat who considered the abolitionist movement the greatest threat to national unity.\n \nAs president, Pierce\u2019s aggressive enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act angered the growing number of anti-slavery voters. Today, many historians and scholars contend that the failure of his decidedly pro-slavery policies to halt secession and prevent the Civil War make Pierce one of America\u2019s worst and least effective presidents.\u00a0\u00a0\n \nFifteenth President James Buchanan served from 1857 to 1861 and had previously served as Secretary of State and as a member of the House and Senate.\n \nElected just before the Civil War, Buchanan inherited\u2014but mostly failed to address\u2014the issues of enslavement and secession. After his election, he angered Republican abolitionists and Northern Democrats alike by supporting the Supreme Court\u2019s Dred Scott v. Sandford ruling and siding with southern lawmakers in their attempts to admit Kansas to the Union as a pro-slavery state.\u200b\n \nConsidered one of the worst U.S. presidents, 17th President Andrew Johnson served from 1865 to 1869.\n \nHaving been elected vice president to Republican Abraham Lincoln on the post-Civil War reconstruction period National Union ticket, Johnson assumed the presidency after Lincoln was assassinated.\n \nAs president, Johnson\u2019s refusal to ensure the protection of formerly enslaved people from potential federal prosecution resulted in his impeachment by the Republican-dominated House of Representatives. Though he was acquitted in the Senate by one vote, Johnson never ran for reelection.\u00a0\u00a0\n \nAs the only president ever elected to two non-consecutive terms, 22nd and 24th President Grover Cleveland served from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897.\n \nHis pro-business policies and demand for fiscal conservatism won Cleveland the support of both Democrats and Republicans. However, his inability to reverse the depression of the Panic of 1893 decimated the Democratic Party and set the stage for a Republican landslide in the 1894 mid-term congressional election.\n \nCleveland would be the last Democrat to win the presidency until the 1912 election of Woodrow Wilson.\n Getty Images/De Agostini / Biblioteca Ambrosiana \nElected in 1912, after 23 years of Republican dominance, Democrat and 28th President Woodrow Wilson would serve two terms from 1913 to 1921.\n \nAlong with leading the nation during World War I, Wilson drove the enactment of progressive social reform legislation the likes of which would not be seen again until Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal of 1933.\n \nIssues facing the nation at the time of Wilson\u2019s election included the question of women\u2019s suffrage, which he opposed, calling it a matter for the states to decide.\n Getty Images /\u00a0De Agostini / Biblioteca Ambrosiana \nElected to an unprecedented and now constitutionally impossible four terms, 32nd President Franklin D. Roosevelt, popularly known as FDR, served from 1933 until his death in 1945.\n \nWidely considered one of the greatest presidents, Roosevelt led the United States through no less desperate crises than the Great Depression during his first two terms and World War II during his last two.\n \nToday, Roosevelt\u2019s depression-ending New Deal package of social reform programs is considered the prototype for American liberalism.\u00a0\n \nPerhaps best known for his decision to end World War II by dropping atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 33rd president Harry S. Truman took office upon the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt and served from 1945 to 1953.\n \nDespite famous headlines erroneously announcing his defeat, Truman defeated Republican Thomas Dewey in the 1948 election. As president, Truman faced the Korean War, the emerging threat of communism, and the start of the Cold War. Truman\u2019s domestic policy marked him as a moderate Democrat whose liberal legislative agenda resembled Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal.\n \nPopularly known as JFK, John F. Kennedy served as 35th president from 1961 until his assassination in November 1963.\n \nServing at the height of the Cold War, JFK spent much of his time in office dealing with relations with the Soviet Union, highlighted by the tense atomic diplomacy of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n \nCalling it the \u201cNew Frontier,\u201d Kennedy\u2019s domestic program promised greater funding for education, medical care for the elderly, economic aid to rural areas, and an end to racial discrimination.\n \nIn addition, JFK officially launched America into the \u201cSpace Race\u201d with the Soviets, culminating with the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969.\u200b\n \nAssuming the office after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, 36th President Lyndon B. Johnson served from 1963 to 1969.\n \nWhile much of his time in office was spent defending his often controversial role in the escalation of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, Johnson succeeded in passing legislation first conceived in President Kennedy\u2019s \u201cNew Frontier\u201d plan.\n \nJohnson\u2019s \u201cGreat Society\u201d program, consisted of social reform legislation protecting civil rights, prohibiting racial discrimination, and expanding programs like Medicare, Medicaid, aid to education, and the arts. Johnson is also remembered for his \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d program, which created jobs and helped millions of Americans overcome poverty.\u00a0\n \nThe son of a successful Georgia peanut farmer, Jimmy Carter served as 39th president from 1977 to 1981.\n \nAs his first official act, Carter granted presidential pardons to all Vietnam War-era military draft evaders. He also oversaw the creation of two new cabinet-level federal departments, the Department of Energy and the Department of Education. Having specialized in nuclear power while in the Navy, Carter ordered the creation of America\u2019s first national energy policy and pursued the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.\n \nIn foreign policy, Carter escalated the Cold War by ending d\u00e9tente. Near the end of his single term, Carter was faced by the 1979-1981 Iran hostage crisis and the international boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\u00a0\n Getty Images/Michael Loccisano \nFormer Arkansas governor Bill Clinton served two terms as the 42nd president from 1993 to 2001. Considered a centrist, Clinton attempted to create policies that balanced conservative and liberal philosophies.\n \nAlong with welfare reform legislation, he drove the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. In 1998, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice relating to his admitted affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n \nAcquitted by the Senate in 1999, Clinton went on to complete his second term during which the government recorded its first budget surplus since 1969.\n \nIn foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in Bosnia and Kosovo and signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein.\u00a0\n \nThe first African American elected to the office, Barack Obama served two terms as 44th president from 2009 to 2017. While best remembered for \u201cObamacare,\u201d the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obama signed many landmark bills into law.

Keep in mind that the term \u201cacademic\u201d is used pretty loosely in this context. This means that art awards, publications, and athletic awards are all fair game. An honor is when someone is officially recognized and respected for their accomplishments. An award is a prize someone receives for something special they have achieved.

Four years ago, Litman spent Election Night here, waiting excitedly in a holding area with other staffers on Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. The intended metaphor was not subtle: Clinton was to declare her victory as America\u2019s first woman president beneath a literal glass ceiling, shattering the most notorious gender barrier in politics. When Clinton lost, Litman, who served as Clinton\u2019s email director, felt more than just professional defeat. She believed the election was about proving that a woman similar to herself\u2014often described as too ambitious, too much, or too loud\u2014could succeed in America. \u201cIf you had asked me the next morning, \u2018Will we ever have a woman president?\u2019 I would have stopped crying hard enough to tell you to fuck off,\u201d Litman told me. \u201cIt felt unimaginable.\u201d These days, the Javits Center\u2014still glass, still not shattered, and what happened to all those Election Night balloons that never dropped?\u2014has become even more of a poisoned metaphor. This spring, as New York City became the global epicenter of the pandemic, the Army Corps of Engineers retrofitted the conference center into a temporary field hospital, where doctors treated more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients. Most entrances to the building have now been sealed shut. Men in military fatigues guard a formidable-looking security area off 34th Street. On the morning I met Litman there, the wide avenues around the building, normally chaotic with honking taxis and daredevil drivers, were apocalyptically empty. The city, and the country, felt resigned to a collective standstill. Harris\u2019s nomination is historic: She is the first Black woman, the first Asian American woman, and the first graduate of a historically Black college or university to join a major party\u2019s presidential ticket. If Joe Biden wins in November, she\u2019ll be America\u2019s first woman vice president. But this milestone is bittersweet for people like Litman, who can\u2019t help feeling cynical after living through Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the economic collapse that followed. \u201cI haven\u2019t really wrapped my head around how it will feel to watch a woman accept the nomination for vice president,\u201d Litman told me as we sat on a bench by the river, tears welling over her black face mask. \u201cI can\u2019t let myself think about it. It\u2019s too hard.\u201d Read: Has the Women\u2019s March accomplished anything? Since she was a little girl, Litman has been obsessed with getting women elected to national office. In high school, she wrote a paper about Geraldine Ferraro, who in 1984 became the first female major-party candidate for vice president. Litman wrote her college thesis about women running against other women. When she graduated from Northwestern University in 2012, she made every career choice with an eye toward getting a job on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. But after Clinton\u2019s loss, she began to see the country\u2019s focus on national elections as misguided. Litman and a fellow political operative, Ross Morales Rocketto, started Run for Something, an organization that recruits and promotes progressives under 40 who want to campaign for state or local office. The group expects to have roughly 500 candidates on ballots across the country this November, and a majority of them are women. \u201cThe possibility for one of the women that we\u2019re working with now to become governor, to become senator, [or] to become president feels so much more realistic\u201d than a woman winning at the national level right now, she said. \u201cI have to imagine that in two or four or 10 years, we\u2019ll be ready for her.\u201d And yet, despite her scars from 2016, Litman found herself getting her hopes up during the Democratic presidential primary. She was inspired by Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s short-lived campaign, which focused explicitly on promoting women and families. She loved all the selfies Elizabeth Warren took with young women, making them pinkie promise to remember that running for president is \u201cwhat girls do.\u201d But as time went on, it became clear to Litman that the Democratic nominee would once again be a man. \u201cThe day Elizabeth Warren dropped out was devastating. I cried,\u201d Litman said. She wrote an op-ed in Cosmopolitan, cheekily titled \u201cStop Lying, America: You Were Never Gonna Vote for a Woman President.\u201d Biden seemed to realize that voters like Litman will not be thrilled to cast a ballot for yet another white guy in 2020. In March, he promised to pick a woman as his vice president. But that seemingly well-meaning gesture backfired. \u201cWill she be short or tall, big or small, black or white, left or center? Who is to say, really,\u201d wrote New York\u2019s Rebecca Traister this spring. \u201cShe will be A Woman\u2122.\u201d Litman similarly saw Biden\u2019s pledge as \u201cdeeply fucked up.\u201d By declaring he would pick a woman from the outset, Biden opened the way for his opponents to claim that his running mate was on the ticket just \u201cbecause she\u2019s a lady, and not because she\u2019s good at her job,\u201d Litman told me. Now Litman fears that Harris will have to endure a fall full of racist and sexist attacks, only to risk being blamed by the pundit class if Biden loses. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be miserable for her, miserable for her staff,\u201d Litman said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish that job on my worst enemy.\u201d Harris isn\u2019t the only woman carrying a disproportionate burden this election season. Reporting and polling suggest that women have generally taken on more child care and household duties than their male partners since the onset of the pandemic. Women are more likely than men to work as nurses and elder-care aides, some of the professional roles most affected by COVID-19. More women than men have also lost their jobs in the recession caused by nationwide shutdowns. When November arrives, women voters might decide who wins the presidential election: Women\u2019s political activism helped flip the House of Representatives from red to blue in 2018. Since then, women\u2019s anger has only escalated, putting Trump well behind Biden in recent polls. Read: What America lost as women entered the workforce \u201cIt does feel like a consolation prize,\u201d Litman told me of Harris\u2019s VP nomination. \u201cBut it also feels like a consolation prize I will happily take.\u201d She finds it easier to be optimistic, and to live with the daily rage she feels about the state of American politics, because she is helping cultivate the women who will one day serve in state legislatures, governors\u2019 mansions, and maybe even the White House. Her ultimate goal is to make a woman\u2019s being named to a presidential ticket unremarkable. \u201cI hope there is a day when it is so deeply boring that women are running for office and winning, and there can be just as many mediocre women as there are mediocre men,\u201d she said. Still, in spite of herself, when Litman heard that Harris was the one, she felt excited. Recently, she ordered the new all-woman Barbie campaign-team set that Mattel debuted in honor of the 2020 election, a ploy the company has used to capitalize on feminist despair in nearly every presidential-election year since Bill Clinton was in office. \u201c[I] can\u2019t stop thinking about the photos of [Harris] with the little girls she met on the campaign trail, and how meaningful this will be to them,\u201d Litman texted me. \u201cTo all of us, but especially to them.\u201d"], "https://www.rose-hulman.edu/campus-life/student-services/registrar/rules-and-procedures/honors-and-academic-awards.html": [" The awards described here are presented annually at the Honors and Awards Ceremony, with the exception of the Heminway Gold Medal, the John T.

There are five blanks for academic awards on the common application. Where do you start? What do you include? This shouldn\u2019t be difficult if you\u2019ve been keeping your awards and honors organized in your ScholarPrep Organizer, saved in folders, or saved on your computer.  Academic awards and honors should be the only items listed under the Awards section on your Common Application. This section may not be lengthy if your school does not offer many awards, and that\u2019s okay. Know the correct title of the award you are listing. Look at the certificate, medal, trophy or other item to ensure it\u2019s correct. List the most significant based on the level of recognition first. The highest \u00a0level of recognition is where you should begin: international, to national, to state, to community to school. For example, if you placed 1st in district but 2nd in state in a debate competition, you would list the 2nd place first since it was at a higher level. Next, determine the selectivity for the award. Being an \u201chonor roll\u201d student is not a very selective award as it is very common, especially since so many students are working to get into their college or university of choice. This would be near the bottom of the list based on selectivity. So, if you are a National Merit award winner that would be placed above honor roll student\u2013if you choose to list honor roll student in one of the slots provided for awards. The description of the award should be short and specific. Think Twitter..140 characters or less, but use proper spelling and grammar with no hashtags. Focus your keywords on the selectivity of the award. Do not use unnecessary information. Choose impactful verbs demonstrating selectivity to begin the description: \u201cAwarded\u2026\u201d, \u201cAchieved recognition for\u2026\u201d, \u201cRecognized as\u2026\u201d, etc. Many students earn awards or honors not related to academics. The non-academic awards and honors from athletic events, extracurricular activities, volunteering or from the community should be listed in the Activities section, not awards and honors. For example, if you were captain of the football team, you would include it under football. If you won 2nd place at state in track and field for long jump, you would list that under track & field. When you list activities and non-academic honors, rank them with the most impressive first. For example, if you were a member of FBLA but did not hold any leadership positions it would be listed closer to the bottom following activities with honors/awards. Are you from a small school that doesn\u2019t offer a lot of academic awards? Or, do you want to add more academic awards? Look online to sign up for academic competitions. \u00a0 A good place to look is\u00a0The Center for Future Global Leaders (CFGL). CFGL is a non-profit organization dedicated to cultivating the youth of today into tomorrow\u2019s leaders through educational attainment and character development and sponsors a triad of academic competitions, known as IAC, that seek to recognize outstanding achievement in essay writing, mathematical problem-solving, and a mastery of English vocabulary. The IAC has over 6,000 participants each year from the USA, Canada and South Korea; it recognizes winner at the divisional, regional, national, and international levels. You can also join subject-based clubs that compete, especially if there is one in your future career department. For example, if you are a business, marketing, or finance major you should join FBLA, BPA or DECA and compete in any competitions to gain experience and possibly awards. Academic awards and honors should be a focus of yours once you enter high school. The more elite university you wish to attend, the more prestigious awards you will need to list.

Member of the Democratic Party.Childhood and educationJoseph Biden was born on November 20, 1942 in the working-class town of Scranton, Pennsylvania, USA to a Catholic family of immigrants from Northern Ireland.Joseph's father, Joseph Robinette Biden Sr. (1915-2002), was a small business owner who sold used cars[ru]. Joseph Biden was the first of four children descended from his mother, Catherine Eugenia (Jean) Finnegan (1917-2010), according to various sources, from County Louth in Ireland or from County Derry. His paternal great-great-grandfather, William Biden, was born in Sussex, England, and emigrated to the United States. His great-grandfather, Edward F. Blewitt, was a member of the Pennsylvania Senate. He has two brothers, James Bryan and Francis, and a sister, Valerie Owens.Pictured is Joe Biden as a child:Joseph Biden studied St. Helena High School in Wilmington, and then the private preparatory school \"Archmere Academy\" in Claymont, Delaware, where he became a member of the student football team and showed good success in football. Joe also played baseball. He later attended the University of Delaware, graduating in 1965 with a bachelor's degree in history and political science. Biden graduated from Syracuse University Law School in New York State with a juris doctor degree in 1968. According to the recollections of his fellow students, he was a mediocre student, but he had outstanding leadership qualities. Biden was directly involved in student life and was elected class president several times.As a child, Biden stuttered a lot, but his speech improved when he \"changed his third decade.\" Biden said he was able to improve his speech by reading poetry in front of a mirror.Pictured is Joe Biden in his youth:Political careerIn 1968, Biden participated in the campaign to support the Republican candidate for governor of Delaware. But Republican attempts to attract Biden to his party failed because of his dislike of Republican President Richard Nixon (1968-1974). Despite the dislike, Biden did not support the movement against the Vietnam War, and he avoided conscription due to asthma.In 1969, Biden joined the Democratic Party and founded the private law firm Biden and Walsh, which, in addition to criminal and corporate cases, was engaged in property management.Pictured is Joe Biden as a young man:Joseph Biden became the fifth-youngest senator in U.S. history at the age of 30 (the minimum age to become a senator) and has since been re-elected from Delaware. In 1974, the Times editorial board included Senator Biden among the \"200 faces of the future who will make history\", referring to the democratic attitude to civil rights, and as a conservative, noting the negative attitude to abortion.As a Senator, Biden was involved in the development and implementation of many bills, including the sensational and extremely tough \"Anti-Crime Act\" of 1984. It expanded criminal liability for cyber fraud and hostage-taking, increased responsibility for the cultivation and sale of marijuana, and allowed the confiscation of property from members of organized crime groups.The politician also voted for a law prohibiting homosexuals from serving in the military and for a law banning same-sex marriage, which was later repealed under President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\n\nBiden was a fierce opponent of racial integration in schools (when black students were forced to attend schools for whites). He believed that \"the disordered abolition of segregation would turn schools into a racial jungle.\" This caused protests from his constituents.The so-called \"three-error system\" was introduced, which is still in effect in 28 states: long sentences are given to criminals only after the third offense. As a result, crime has indeed decreased, but the number of prisoners has increased dramatically, and mainly among national minorities. Therefore, Biden's supporters were mostly people with white color skin[ru].In 1988, Biden was diagnosed with an aneurysm of two vessels of the brain, in critical condition, he was taken to the hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. Seven months later, Biden was able to return to work in the Senate.Pictured: Joe Biden - US Senator:Biden focused his work in the Senate around environmental and civil rights issues. He played a key role in shaping U.S. international policy, dealing with issues such as weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, post-Cold War Europe, and regions such as the Middle East and Southwest Asia. In the field of foreign policy, he maintained a dialogue with the USSR[ru] on the reduction of nuclear weapons. In 1983, he opposed the Reagan Administration's Strategic Missile Defense Initiative, which he considered a violation of treaties previously reached by the United States with the USSR.In 1979 and 1988, Senator Biden visited Moscow twice at the invitation of the Soviet leadership, was received by Alexey Kosygin and Andrey Gromyko, and discussed disarmament issues.From 1987-1995, Biden served as head of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He promoted the adoption of a number of laws against violence against women in the family and on mandatory verification by the seller of the buyer's personal information when selling firearms. Supported international initiatives to control carbon emissions and greenhouse gases.Through his work on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden was named one of the\"Twelve People Who Changed the World.\" Biden was actively involved in resolving conflicts in the Balkans; in 1993, he held a meeting with the President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, at which he accused him of war crimes and promised him a trial. In 1999, he supported the NATO military operation against Yugoslavia. Biden was also a supporter of removing Saddam Hussein, who, according to him, posed a threat to national security.Biden often acted in the interests of the Armenian lobby and in 1995-2007 was a member of the Group on Armenian Affairs of the US Congress. He voted for the adoption of the anti-Azerbaijani Amendment 907 and for the allocation of American financial assistance to Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in 1992-2008.Joseph served as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee three times (2001-2003 and 2007-2009).Biden was a supporter of the military campaigns in Afghanistan in 2001 and in Iraq in 2003. He supported the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and opposed the build-up of the American military contingent in that country. He was one of the main opponents of the campaign launched by George W. Bush in December 2001 to withdraw from the Soviet-American ABM Treaty of 1972, and believed that this would negatively affect relations with Russia[ru]. Biden called the campaign a \"theological mission \" motivated by\" ideological bias and commitment \"that led to\"total madness.\"\n\n\nBiden is the author of the bill, which on September 26, 2007, the US Senate passed a resolution on supporting a federal state system in Iraq: a federation of three regions \u2014 Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite.In 2008, Biden was one of the most experienced senators, having served as a representative from Delaware for 35 years.

As Vice President, he paid close attention to foreign policy issues. He has repeatedly visited Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Supported the federalization of Iraq.Biden was actually the main curator of the Obama administration's foreign policy course, paying special attention to Iraq, Syria and the former Soviet republics.

Bush in December 2001 to withdraw from the Soviet-American ABM Treaty of 1972, and believed that this would negatively affect relations with Russia[ru].

For example, at a meeting with voters in Los Angeles in March 2020, Biden introduced his sister Valerie to the audience, while pointing hand to his wife who was standing next to him.

On January 5, 1973, he was sworn in at the hospital where his sons were lying. The young senator began to take the train from Delaware to Washington and back every day, spending an hour and a half on the road.

The press accused Biden and his son Hunter of having ties to the Ukrainian gas oligarch, former Minister of Ecology, as well as the owner of Burisma Holdings, Mykola Zlochevsky.

The company was registered in Cyprus in 2002 and is engaged in the development of deposits in the Dnieper-Donetsk, Carpathian and Azov-Kuban basins.According to The New York Times, during his visit to Ukraine in March 2016, Biden threatened to delay the provision of US guarantees for a loan to Ukraine in the amount of $ 1 billion if the prosecutor General, who was accused of inaction in the fight against corruption, was not dismissed, whose responsibility included possible offenses in the activities of Burisma Holdings (Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was dismissed on April 3, 2016).On September 23, Republican Senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley released a report on Hunter Biden's questionable dealings. The document describes millions of money transfers related to Biden Jr.'s work at Burisma in Ukraine.

It expanded criminal liability for cyber fraud and hostage-taking, increased responsibility for the cultivation and sale of marijuana, and allowed the confiscation of property from members of organized crime groups.The politician also voted for a law prohibiting homosexuals from serving in the military and for a law banning same-sex marriage, which was later repealed under President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\n\nBiden was a fierce opponent of racial integration in schools (when black students were forced to attend schools for whites). He believed that \"the disordered abolition of segregation would turn schools into a racial jungle.\" This caused protests from his constituents.The so-called \"three-error system\" was introduced, which is still in effect in 28 states: long sentences are given to criminals only after the third offense. As a result, crime has indeed decreased, but the number of prisoners has increased dramatically, and mainly among national minorities. Therefore, Biden's supporters were mostly people with white color skin[ru].In 1988, Biden was diagnosed with an aneurysm of two vessels of the brain, in critical condition, he was taken to the hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. Seven months later, Biden was able to return to work in the Senate.Pictured: Joe Biden - US Senator:Biden focused his work in the Senate around environmental and civil rights issues. He played a key role in shaping U.S. international policy, dealing with issues such as weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, post-Cold War Europe, and regions such as the Middle East and Southwest Asia.

He supported the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and opposed the build-up of the American military contingent in that country. He was one of the main opponents of the campaign launched by George W. Bush in December 2001 to withdraw from the Soviet-American ABM Treaty of 1972, and believed that this would negatively affect relations with Russia[ru]. Biden called the campaign a \"theological mission \" motivated by\" ideological bias and commitment \"that led to\"total madness.\"\n\n\nBiden is the author of the bill, which on September 26, 2007, the US Senate passed a resolution on supporting a federal state system in Iraq: a federation of three regions \u2014 Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite.In 2008, Biden was one of the most experienced senators, having served as a representative from Delaware for 35 years.

That is why today I am announcing my candidacy for the US presidential election.\" At the same time, Biden became the 20th politician to declare his intention to seek the nomination from the Democratic Party in the 2020 elections.The report of Biden's doctor[ru], published by the politician's campaign headquarters, states that Biden, for health reasons[ru], can serve as head of state, is \"healthy[ru] and active\", and the candidate \"does not have any diseases[ru] or violations that could prevent him from being the head of the American administration.\" According to the doctor, Biden sometimes has a violation of the normal rhythm of heart[ru] contractions, but this does not create serious difficulties. The report also said that Biden regularly exercises, does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. One day, he said: \"There were enough alcoholics in my own family.\"Critics of Joe Biden also do not tire of reminding about his age and possible health problems. The 77-year-old politician does often speak up during public speeches, slurring words or making strange statements. For example, at a meeting with voters in Los Angeles in March 2020, Biden introduced his sister Valerie to the audience, while pointing hand to his wife who was standing next to him. Such incidents give rise to his opponents to speculate that the former vice president develops senile dementia, although this diagnosis has never been officially confirmed by anyone.Biden is known for his reservations and extravagant statements.

On January 5, 1973, he was sworn in at the hospital where his sons were lying. The young senator began to take the train from Delaware to Washington and back every day, spending an hour and a half on the road. His sister Valerie had moved in with him to take care of the children.Pictured is Joe Biden and his wife Jill:She lived in her brother's house until 1977, when Biden married his current wife, Jill Tracy Jacobs, who teaches English at the university and heads the Breast Cancer Society.

As the title of the book, Biden used his son's phrase \"Promise me, Dad, that you will be all right.\" Beau, who was dying of cancer, asked his father some time before his death to bravely survive the impending loss.Allegations of corruptionBiden was considered an unofficial curator of the Ukrainian direction in the Obama administration. The press accused Biden and his son Hunter of having ties to the Ukrainian gas oligarch, former Minister of Ecology, as well as the owner of Burisma Holdings, Mykola Zlochevsky. Burisma Holding includes several Ukrainian oil and gas companies, including Esco-Pivnich and Pari. The company was registered in Cyprus in 2002 and is engaged in the development of deposits in the Dnieper-Donetsk, Carpathian and Azov-Kuban basins.According to The New York Times, during his visit to Ukraine in March 2016, Biden threatened to delay the provision of US guarantees for a loan to Ukraine in the amount of $ 1 billion if the prosecutor General, who was accused of inaction in the fight against corruption, was not dismissed, whose responsibility included possible offenses in the activities of Burisma Holdings (Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was dismissed on April 3, 2016).On September 23, Republican Senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley released a report on Hunter Biden's questionable dealings. The document describes millions of money transfers related to Biden Jr.'s work at Burisma in Ukraine. The report alleges that he received significant sums from individuals associated with the Chinese Communist Party, as well as from Elena Baturina, the widow of former Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.On the day of the official announcement of Joe Biden's participation in the election campaign, Hunter's son resigned from the board of directors of Burisma Holdings.

It expanded criminal liability for cyber fraud and hostage-taking, increased responsibility for the cultivation and sale of marijuana, and allowed the confiscation of property from members of organized crime groups.The politician also voted for a law prohibiting homosexuals from serving in the military and for a law banning same-sex marriage, which was later repealed under President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\n\nBiden was a fierce opponent of racial integration in schools (when black students were forced to attend schools for whites). He believed that \"the disordered abolition of segregation would turn schools into a racial jungle.\" This caused protests from his constituents.The so-called \"three-error system\" was introduced, which is still in effect in 28 states: long sentences are given to criminals only after the third offense. As a result, crime has indeed decreased, but the number of prisoners has increased dramatically, and mainly among national minorities. Therefore, Biden's supporters were mostly people with white color skin[ru].In 1988, Biden was diagnosed with an aneurysm of two vessels of the brain, in critical condition, he was taken to the hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery. Seven months later, Biden was able to return to work in the Senate.Pictured: Joe Biden - US Senator:Biden focused his work in the Senate around environmental and civil rights issues. He played a key role in shaping U.S. international policy, dealing with issues such as weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, post-Cold War Europe, and regions such as the Middle East and Southwest Asia.

Bush in December 2001 to withdraw from the Soviet-American ABM Treaty of 1972, and believed that this would negatively affect relations with Russia[ru]. Biden called the campaign a \"theological mission \" motivated by\" ideological bias and commitment \"that led to\"total madness.\"\n\n\nBiden is the author of the bill, which on September 26, 2007, the US Senate passed a resolution on supporting a federal state system in Iraq: a federation of three regions \u2014 Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite.In 2008, Biden was one of the most experienced senators, having served as a representative from Delaware for 35 years.

For example, at a meeting with voters in Los Angeles in March 2020, Biden introduced his sister Valerie to the audience, while pointing hand to his wife who was standing next to him.

On January 5, 1973, he was sworn in at the hospital where his sons were lying. The young senator began to take the train from Delaware to Washington and back every day, spending an hour and a half on the road. His sister Valerie had moved in with him to take care of the children.Pictured is Joe Biden and his wife Jill:She lived in her brother's house until 1977, when Biden married his current wife, Jill Tracy Jacobs, who teaches English at the university and heads the Breast Cancer Society.

Bush in December 2001 to withdraw from the Soviet-American ABM Treaty of 1972, and believed that this would negatively affect relations with Russia[ru]. Biden called the campaign a \"theological mission \" motivated by\" ideological bias and commitment \"that led to\"total madness.\"\n\n\nBiden is the author of the bill, which on September 26, 2007, the US Senate passed a resolution on supporting a federal state system in Iraq: a federation of three regions \u2014 Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite.In 2008, Biden was one of the most experienced senators, having served as a representative from Delaware for 35 years.

According to Human Events Senior Editor Jack Posobiec, Jill Biden has been asking if there\u2019s a process to remove a sitting Vice President. Jill has been asking if there\u2019s a process to remove a sitting VP \u2014 Jack Posobiec \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JackPosobiec) October 27, 2021  This isn\u2019t the first time that Jill Biden and Kamala Harris have reportedly had issues. According to Human Events Senior Editor Jack Posobiec, the comments Kamala Harris made about going to Europe were directed at Jill Biden. Who do you think go Kamala sent to Guatemala during the G7 in London? Pay attention pic.twitter.com/UbNGDeRMe1 \u2014 Jack Posobiec \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JackPosobiec) June 11, 2021  After the first Dem debate where Kamala attacked Joe Biden, Jill Biden was angered by Kamala and attacked her in a call with close supporters. From Politico:\u00a0 The aides could do the political maneuvering after Harris\u2019 attack. Jill was and is the guardian of the Biden honor, the Biden id. She couldn\u2019t bear to watch a woman who called herself a friend of her son\u2019s\u2014although Beau was not her biological child, she\u2019d raised him his entire life as if he were\u2014try to tear her husband down, to score a point at a debate. \u201cWith what he cares about, what he fights for, what he\u2019s committed to, you get up there and call him a racist without basis?\u201d she said on a phone call with close supporters a week later, according to multiple people on the call. \u201cGo f\u2014 yourself.\u201d To make things even worse for Kamala her first foreign policy trip turned out to be a complete disaster. Can the vice president of the United States be fired? There are ways a vice president can be forced to leave office \u2013 but the VP cannot be \u201cfired.\u201d A vice president \u2013 along with the president \u2013 can be impeached from office. The Constitution gives Congress the power to impeach and remove the president, the VP, and other federal \u201ccivil officers\u201d for treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. If a president dies, resigns, or is forced out through impeachment, he or she would be succeeded by the vice president. In those scenarios, the VP would lose his or her job but would get a promotion. Vice President Harry Truman became president when Franklin Roosevelt died in 1945, and VP Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon in 1974 when the Watergate scandal forced Nixon to resign. Both Truman and Ford would lead the country through turbulent times. Alex D is a conservative journalist, who covers all issues of importance for conservatives.

Photo by David Lienemann/The White House Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., represented Delaware for 36 years in the U.S. Senate before becoming the 47th Vice President of the United States. On January 20, 2021, he was sworn in as the 46th President of the United States. Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., was born November 20, 1942, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the first of four siblings. In 1953, the Biden family moved from Pennsylvania to Claymont, Delaware. He graduated from the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School and served on the New Castle County Council. Then, at age 29, he became one of the youngest people ever elected to the United States Senate. Just weeks after the election, tragedy struck the Biden family when then Senator-elect Biden's wife, Neilia, and their one-year-old daughter, Naomi, died and his 2 sons were injured in an auto accident. President\u00a0Biden was sworn into the U.S. Senate at his sons' hospital bedside and began commuting to Washington every day by train, a practice he maintained throughout his career in the Senate. In 1977, President\u00a0Biden married Jill Jacobs. Jill Biden, who holds a Doctorate in Education, is a life-long educator and currently teaches at a community college in Northern Virginia. The President's son, Beau, was Delaware's Attorney General from 2007-2015 and a Major in the 261st Signal Brigade of the Delaware National Guard. He was deployed to Iraq in 2008-2009. Beau passed away in 2015 after battling brain cancer with the same integrity, courage, and strength he demonstrated every day of his life. The\u00a0President's second son, Hunter, is an attorney who manages a private equity firm in Washington, D.C. His daughter Ashley is a social worker and Executive Director of the Delaware Center for Justice. President Biden has five grandchildren: Naomi, Finnegan, Roberta Mabel (\"Maisy\"), Natalie, and Robert Hunter. As a Senator from Delaware for 36 years, President\u00a0Biden established himself as a leader in facing some of our nation's most important domestic and international challenges. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for 17 years, then-Senator Biden was widely recognized for his work on criminal justice issues, including the landmark 1994 Crime Act and the Violence Against Women Act. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years, then-Senator Biden played a pivotal role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. He has been at the forefront of issues and legislation related to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, post-Cold War Europe, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia. As the 47th Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden continued his leadership on important issues facing the nation and represented America abroad, traveling over 1.2 million miles to more than 50 countries. Vice President Biden convened sessions of the President's Cabinet, led interagency efforts, and worked with Congress in his fight to raise the living standards of middle class Americans, reduce gun violence, and address violence against women. In the final year of the Administration, Vice President Biden led the Cancer Moonshot, an international effort to end cancer as we know it. Since leaving the White House in January 2017, President\u00a0Biden has continued his legacy of expanding opportunity for all, both in the United States and abroad, with the creation of the Biden Foundation, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania, the Biden Cancer Initiative, and the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware. Through these non-profit organizations,\u00a0President Biden and Dr. Biden are developing programs designed to advance smart policies, convene experts and world leaders on the issues they care most about, and impact the national debate about how America can continue to lead in the 21st century. In addition,\u00a0President Biden formed a political action committee, \"American Possibilities,\" which will allow him to continue to support Democratic candidates and causes across the country. Finally, in November 2017, Presiden\u00a0\u200bBiden released his second book, Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose. The book, a New York Times #1 Bestseller, is a personal story from a father, grandfather, husband, and friend as he confronts the inevitability of devastating personal loss, while trying to balance his duty to his family and his country. He has received numerous awards and accolades, including the National Civil Rights Museum's Freedom Award and the Medal of Freedom with Distinction.
