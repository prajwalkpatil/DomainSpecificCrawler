This is yet another chapter in the brief journey of the franchise's newest games, which have been plagued by various issues and complaints. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet introduce players to Generation 9 Pokemon. The games are set in the new Paldea region which is an open world and has three storylines that the player can follow. This gives Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players a wealth of content to explore on their journey to becoming a Pokemon Master. The game also brings new features such as Koraidon and Miraidon, Pokemon that serve as mounts, and the Terastal phenomenon. Another new feature is Ed Sheeran's music in the game, which has been causing problems on Twitch. RELATED: Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Duplication Glitch Can Get Players Infinite Shinies Players who are finishing the game are finding that Ed Sheeran's song \"Celestial\" plays during the end credits, which is turning into DMCA strikes. On November 22 the streamer aDrive was one of the first to mention that he had received a copyright strike from the label. The streamer warned other creators who are about to finish the game soon about the problem, that they should not stream the end credits with music. The platform's problem with DMCA is not new, and has already yielded situations such as streamers banned without Twitch indicating the content. \"Celestial\" caused divided reactions among Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players on social media, and while there were players who enjoyed the song, others were not as receptive to Ed Sheeran's collaboration with The Pokemon Company. The day the games were released also saw the official release of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's first mod to remove \"Celestial\" from the game. Last year Back 4 Blood received backlash for including licensed music without a \"stream safe\" option. This type of feature allows players to disable music from games to avoid copyright issues, with Fortnite being a prime example of a game that has this feature. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet for their part continues to face a wave of controversies that are leading the games to be review bombed. The games are being criticized mainly because of performance problems, bugs, and glitches, which have caused moments like Psyduck to spawn in random situations. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are available now on Nintendo Switch.

The AMD Ryzen 5 2500U mid-range quad-core notebook CPU is no exception. AMD Ryzen 5 2500U CPU Benchmark  Performance of the main processing part of the Ryzen 5 2500U is in line with corresponding Intel CPU \u2013 the 8th Generation Core i5-8250U. These chips can easily handle all daily home and office tasks. They also offer good potential for demanding duties like video editing, but if you do that as your main job then its worth investing in Intel\u2019s top tier (but also power hungry) six-core processors, like the Core i7-8750H / i7-8850H. Where Ryzen 5 2500U has a great advantage over the i5-8250U is the graphics processing department. In gaming benchmarks, its Radeon Vega 8 integrated graphics has noticeably higher score than the Intel UHD 620 of the 8th Gen Core processor series. The difference is also very visible during real world gaming. For instance, while you can play GTA 5 on the Intel UHD at around 30fps on lowest settings and 720p resolution, on the Ryzen you can bump up detail settings to mid-to-high with frame rates mostly around 30 fps or more. You can take a look at our\u00a0Ryzen 5 2500U gameplay playlist with videos provided by YouTube community members.  Besides the 5 2500U AMD also offers a Ryzen 7 2700U quad-core model with slightly faster clock speeds and further improved Vega 10 integrated graphics. On the lower-end of the lineup, there are the Ryzen 3 2200U and 3 2300U. These aren\u2019t as fast as the Ryzen 5 and 7, because of their dual-core design and slower Vega 3 and Vega 6 integrated graphics. Note: The benchmark scores of the listed processors are averages measured across various devices with these processors. The scores and real-world performance of the AMD Ryzen 5 2500U and compared CPUs may vary depending on the notebooks' other components, settings, cooling, and other factors. However, the benchmark results are good indicators of the processors' performance. Here are the most important specs of the AMD Ryzen 5 2500U:\r\n AMD Ryzen 5 2500U AMD Ryzen \"Raven Ridge\" Quad-core / 2 computing threads per core 2 \u2013 3.6 GHz 6MB DDR4 (2400 MHz max. speed) AMD Radeon Vega 8 15W 14-nanometer Mainstream laptops & 2-in-1 PCs AMD FreeSync anti-stuttering and anti-tearing video technology AMD SenseMI performance management and boosting Virtualization \u2013 allows the processor to run multiple operating systems simultaneously using virtual platforms Published on October 5, 2017 Below you can read and submit user reviews, questions, and answers about the processor.

External hard drives are sold as computer peripherals and they usually connect to the computer via USB. Performance-wise, HDDs are generally faster when used as internal HDDs than external. But, in both cases SSDs are much faster than HDDs and in your case it looks like the laptop you mentioned has both a fast SSD and a capacious HDD. \n Something wrong with this post?

Well there is also a 256gb ssd variant of the laptop but no hdd. Well I am thinking what if I get the no hdd one and buy extra external instead. But since you have mentioned that it will work much faster when used internal then I will get the ssd with hdd. \n Something wrong with this post? Thanks for letting us know. If you can point us in the right direction... \nThis post was...\n\n \nFlag for removal\n\n \nDan Z \n\u2013 May 17, 2019\n Well, depending on the external HDD and USB interface version (if its USB 3.0 or 3.1, not 2.0 on both the external HDD and laptop), it can be actually close performance-wise to the same HDD used internally. What\u2019s \u201cmuch faster\u201d is SSD storage in comparison to HDD. I can also add that if you don\u2019t need a lot of storage space for your work and don\u2019t store a lot of large files like movies, music, and large pictures, then you can get the laptop variant with the 256GB SSD only.

It all depends on a game and graphics settings. For instance, you will be able to play smoothly League of Legends on approximately mid-to-high settings and 1080p resolution, Counter Strike on around mid settings and 720p resolution, Fortnite on the lowest settings and 720p, etc. I would suggest check out the YouTube gameplays on the Ryzen 5 2500U, like the ones above in the playlist. And make sure you\u2019re using dual-channel RAM (2 x 4GB instead of 1 x 8GB etc) for the best gaming performance on the Ryzen 5. \n Something wrong with this post? Thanks for letting us know.

Instead, it uses the main system memory (RAM). There\u2019s a limit for its RAM usage. On recent AMD processors with Radeon graphics, available RAM for graphics purposes is usually up to 2 GB, I\u2019m not sure for the Ryzen 5 2500U in particular. \n Something wrong with this post?

It should be some model from the i7-2xxx series, because of the HD 3000 graphics. Whichever  i7-2xxx model you have, they aren\u2019t much slower in CPU benchmarks than the Ryzen 5 2500U, although these i7 chips are 7 years old. On the negative side, they consume much more power than the Ryzen, 35 -55 Watts versus Ryzen\u2019s 15 W and run hotter. Also, the Ryzen 5 has much better integrated graphics, so if your Premiere version utilizes graphics acceleration, you\u2019ll see some benefits. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what parts of the program will run faster due to better graphics, since I\u2019m not a Premiere user. \n Something wrong with this post? Thanks for letting us know.

Keeping track of performance across modern AMD CPUs can be difficult. AMD releases new Processor SKUs every few Months and entirely new CPU generations about every year and a half. Which AMD Processor is best for you depends on your typical workloads. If you\u2019re a professional doing active work like Photo Editing or 3D Modeling or are running AAA Games, a CPU that has high single-core performance is more important than a CPU with a lot of cores. If you\u2019re running workloads, though, that can easily be parallelized, such as 3D Rendering, Video Editing, Batch Processing, Machine Learning, to name a few, an AMD CPU with a high number of cores is the right pick for you. Most workloads, though can make use of both, fast single-core performance and high multi-core performance, at least to a certain degree, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve created this handy little list of AMD CPUs in order of Performance that you can sort to your liking. *Weighted. Total Performance (column) is relative to an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, weighed equally at 50% single-core and 50% multi-core performance. This weighing will indicate good all-round performance for most workloads without going overboard on too low single-core performance or too many cores.  Note: If you\u2019re running very specific tasks, though, that you know can make good use of, e.g., a lot of cores, sort the table by multi-core performance. Or, if you\u2019re certain your workloads only need high single-core performance, sort by that column. Benchmark used for this list is Cinebench R23. AMD\u2019s entry-level CPUs have extremely high value considering their performance per dollar. Both the AMD Ryzen 3 3100 and 3300X lead the Performance / Dollar Chart given their very reasonable pricing. This is not to say everyone should be buying a Ryzen 3. They are somewhat limited in overall performance and have fewer cores than might be necessary for your workloads, but they are a great pick for many low-level tasks such as general productivity. If your budget is limited, the Ryzen 5 5600X is one of the best CPUs for most workloads and games. If you\u2019re willing to spend some more, the 5900X 12-Core CPU packs some serious performance if your workloads can make use of more cores. In the end, the best AMD CPU for the money depends on your workloads and requirements, and, of course, your budget limit. Let\u2019s take a look at the best CPU within certain price-ranges: After recent considerable price cuts, AMD\u2019s best-performing CPU under 500$ is the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X. At just 450$, the 12-Core CPU is a powerhouse of a CPU that\u2019ll run any high-end workloads without any issues. With a base clock of 3.7GHz and a boost of up to 4.8GHz, the Ryzen 9 sports 24 Threads at a power draw (TDP) of 105W. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is the best CPU you can buy for under 400 dollars. Its price has been reduced to 300$ from its original MSRP of 450$. The 8 Cores and 16 Threads clock at 3.8GHz base and 4.7GHz boost. It, too is manufactured on TSMC\u2019s 7NM node, making it power efficient at 105W TDP. The AMD Ryzen 5 3600 and 3600X are AMD\u2019s best CPUs for under 200 dollars. If you can find it below 200$, the 5600X is the newer generation successor to these CPUs with considerably higher single-core performance and power-efficiency. All Ryzen 5\u2019s are 6-Core CPUs. The 5600X\u2019s 12 Threads clock at 3.7GHz base and up to 4.6GHz boost. Currently, the AMD Threadripper 3990X (Review) and PRO 3995WX both have 64 Cores / 128 Threads at their disposal. On the Server-side, the Epyc 7713P, 7H12, 7702P and 7742, too have 64 Cores that are clocked at varying frequencies and are rated at different TDPs. This depends on the definition of \u201cfast\u201d. The highest multi-core performance is held by AMD\u2019s highest-clocking, highest core-count CPUs, such as the Threadripper 3990X. The highest single-core performance is held by the 5950X and newly released 5800X3D (which makes use of 3D-stacked vCache). Yes. AMD\u2019s CPU segmentation is as follows: The higher the number the higher the core-count, the higher the single-core performance and the higher the power-draw. Anything above 3.5 GHz can be considered \u201cgood\u201d. The more elaborate answer to this, though, would be: \u201cit depends\u201d. You can only compare CPUs within the same generation and brand to each other by their frequency. Between generations and brands, you have to take IPC, Power Draw, Manufacturing Node and other factors into consideration to truly find the best CPU for your needs. It\u2019s best to rely on benchmarks and real-world tests. It depends on your needs and at what time you\u2019re comparing the two. Both AMD and Intel have an excellent product line-up, but they release new SKUs every few months and every 1.5 years or so they release an entirely new generation of CPUs that usually takes back the crown from the competition for some time.

It was released in collaboration with The Pok\u00e9mon Company and appeared in the end credits of Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet games, released on 18 November 2022.[1] Sheeran co-wrote the song alongside Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid, and produced it with Mac. The song was released alongside its music video, which includes Sheeran interacting with a variety of Pok\u00e9mon.\n Sheeran revealed that when he travelled to Japan he met some of the staff from the Pok\u00e9mon games and \"joked about [him] writing a song for them\", which led to the collaboration. Sheeran also explained that he has played Pok\u00e9mon since he was in primary school and called it \"such an honour to add a song into a Pok\u00e9mon game and shoot a nostalgic video too\".[2] He has previously collaborated with the Pok\u00e9mon Company for a performance in Pok\u00e9mon Go and also promoted the 2022 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships in London.[3]\n The music video was also released on 29 September 2022, and was directed by Yuichi Kodama.[4] It depicts Sheeran interacting with a variety of sketch-style Pok\u00e9mon, including \"a Snorlax that saves Sheeran from a car accident to a Lapras that takes him across a river\".

With price-inflations and out-of-stock items, it can be difficult to gauge performance by price alone. That is why I created this List of AMD Graphics Cards in order of Performance. You can sort the list by rendering and gaming performance or value to find the best GPU for your needs. Related: Nvidia Graphics Cards List in Order of Performance  Although it\u2019s not cheap at $649, the AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT is the currently best AMD Graphics Card for the money. With its 16GB of VRAM, it clocks up to 2250 MHz, making any modern Game run at smooth framerates. 4608 Stream Processors accelerate gaming and rendering workloads based on OpenCL and the Power Draw of 300W is decent for such a top-tier GPU. The AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT is the best AMD Graphics Card you can buy for under 500$. It sports 2560 stream processors and has 12GB of VRAM. Its base Frequency clocks at 2321Mhz and boosts up to 2581Mhz. Although the GPU officially has a Total Board Power of 230W, AMD recommends a minimum PSU Wattage of 600W. The AMD Radeon RX 6600 too comes with 8GB of VRAM and has fewer stream processors (2048) and lower clock speeds (1968Mhz base \u2013 2589Mhz boost) than the 6700 XT. It gets by with lower power consumption (160W Total board power) too and costs 80$ less than the 5700XT. For those of you shopping in the 300$ \u2013 400$ range, this GPU is the sweet spot. The AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT is the best AMD GPU at / under 200$. It does only have 4GB of VRAM, which is astonishing for a modern GPU at this price. Its 1024 Stream Processors accelerate your rendering and gaming needs and with boost clocks of up to 2815Mhz you\u2019ll be able to play most modern Games at smooth framerates and mid-to-high settings. As can be seen in this Article\u2019s AMD GPU List, the currently best performing AMD Graphics Card is the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT by a considerable margin. Similarly priced AMD and Nvidia GPUs will mostly perform the same in many workloads. There are some features in games or in render engines, though, that will not look the same or will not be supported on either AMD or Nvidia GPUs. It\u2019s generally safer to buy an Nvidia GPU as it has wider application support. I hope this AMD Radeon GPU List helped you make a decision. What AMD Graphics Card do you want to buy?

In other words are the scores for the RTX 3090 (574/260) and the RX 6900 XT (270/191) benchmarked the same way? Thanks 26 May, 2021 Unfortunately not. Because Render Engines support different kind of GPUs, the scores for Nvidia is taken from Render Engines that run in CUDA mode, and the AMD results are taken from engines that run in OpenCL mode. While both have the same underlying scenes, the architectures can\u2019t be directly compared. The gaming scores can be directly compared. I am thinking of a way to combine them, then we could have a single table, which would make it easier to compare, but for now, we have to keep them separate.

Onward,\u00a0Harvey 2022 GRAMMYs Awards Show: Complete Nominations List Photo:\u00a0Rachel Kupfer\u00a0 list James Brown changed the sound of popular music when he found the power of the one and unleashed the funk with \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag.\" Today, funk lives on in many forms, including these exciting bands from across the world. It's rare that a genre can be traced back to a single artist or group, but for funk, that was James Brown. The Godfather of Soul coined the phrase and style of playing known as \"on the one,\" where the first downbeat is emphasized, instead of the typical second and fourth beats in pop, soul and other styles. As David Cheal eloquently explains, playing on the one \"left space for phrases and riffs, often syncopated around the beat, creating an intricate, interlocking grid which could go on and on.\" You know a funky bassline when you hear it; its fat chords beg your body to get up and groove. Brown's 1965 classic, \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,\" became one of the first funk hits, and has been endlessly sampled and covered over the years, along with his other groovy tracks. Of course, many other funk acts followed in the '60s, and the genre thrived in the '70s and '80s as the disco craze came and went, and the originators of hip-hop and house music created new music from funk and disco's strong, flexible bones built for dancing. Legendary funk bassist Bootsy Collins learned the power of the one from playing in Brown's band, and brought it to George Clinton, who created P-funk, an expansive, Afrofuturistic, psychedelic exploration of funk with his various bands and projects, including Parliament-Funkadelic. Both Collins and Clinton remain active and funkin', and have offered their timeless grooves to collabs with younger artists, including Kali Uchis, Silk Sonic, and Omar Apollo; and Kendrick Lamar, Flying Lotus, and Thundercat, respectively. In the 1980s, electro-funk was born when artists like Afrika Bambaataa, Man Parrish, and Egyptian Lover began making futuristic beats with the Roland TR-808 drum machine \u2014 often with robotic vocals distorted through a talk box. A key distinguishing factor of electro-funk is a de-emphasis on vocals, with more phrases than choruses and verses. The sound influenced contemporaneous hip-hop, funk and electronica, along with acts around the globe, while current acts like Chromeo, DJ Stingray, and even Egyptian Lover himself keep electro-funk alive and well. Today, funk lives in many places, with its heavy bass and syncopated grooves finding way into many nooks and crannies of music. There's nu-disco and boogie funk, nodding back to disco bands with soaring vocals and dance floor-designed instrumentation. G-funk continues to influence Los Angeles hip-hop, with innovative artists like Dam-Funk and Channel Tres bringing the funk and G-funk, into electro territory. Funk and disco-centered '70s revival is definitely having a moment, with acts like Ghost Funk Orchestra and Parcels, while its sparkly sprinklings can be heard in pop from Dua Lipa, Doja Cat, and, in full \"Soul Train\" character, Silk Sonic. There are also acts making dreamy, atmospheric music with a solid dose of funk, such as Khruangbin\u2019s global sonic collage. There are many bands that play heavily with funk, creating lush grooves designed to get you moving. Read on for a taste of five current modern funk and nu-disco artists making band-led uptempo funk built for the dance floor. Be sure to press play on the Spotify playlist above, and check out GRAMMY.com's playlist on Apple Music, Amazon Music and Pandora. Aptly self-described as \"discodelic soul,\" Brooklyn-based seven-piece Say She She make dreamy, operatic funk, led by singer-songwriters Nya Gazelle Brown, Piya Malik and Sabrina Mileo Cunningham. Their '70s girl group-inspired vocal harmonies echo, sooth and enchant as they cover poignant topics with feminist flair. While they\u2019ve been active in the New York scene for a few years, they\u2019ve gained wider acclaim for the irresistible music they began releasing this year, including their debut album, Prism. Their 2022 debut single \"Forget Me Not\" is an ode to ground-breaking New York art collective Guerilla Girls, and \"Norma\" is their protest anthem in response to the news that Roe vs. Wade could be (and was) overturned. The band name is a nod to funk legend Nile Rodgers, from the \"Le freak, c'est chi\" exclamation in Chic's legendary tune \"Le Freak.\" Moniquea's unique voice oozes confidence, yet invites you in to dance with her to the super funky boogie rhythms. The Pasadena, California artist was raised on funk music; her mom was in a cover band that would play classics like Aretha Franklin\u2019s \"Get It Right\" and Gladys Knight\u2019s\u00a0\"Love Overboard.\" Moniquea released her first boogie funk track at 20 and, in 2011, met local producer XL Middelton \u2014 a bonafide purveyor of funk. She's been a star artist on his MoFunk Records ever since, and they've collabed on countless tracks, channeling West Coast energy with a heavy dose of G-funk, sunny lyrics and upbeat, roller disco-ready rhythms. Her latest release is an upbeat nod to classic West Coast funk, produced by Middleton, and follows her February 2022 groovy, collab-filled album, On Repeat. Shiro Schwarz is a Mexico City-based duo, consisting of Pammela Rojas and Rafael Marfil, who helped establish a modern funk scene in the richly creative Mexican metropolis. On \"Electrify\" \u2014 originally released in 2016 on Fat Beats Records and reissued in 2021 by MoFunk \u2014 Shiro Schwarz's vocals playfully contrast each other, floating over an insistent, upbeat bassline and an '80s throwback electro-funk rhythm with synth flourishes. Their music manages to be both nostalgic and futuristic \u2014 and impossible to sit still to. 2021 single \"Be Kind\" is sweet, mellow and groovy, perfect chic lounge funk. Shiro Schwarz\u2019s latest track, the joyfully nostalgic \"Hey DJ,\" is a collab with funkstress Saucy Lady and U-Key. L'Imp\u00e9ratrice (the empress in French) are a six-piece Parisian group serving an infectiously joyful blend of French pop, nu-disco, funk and psychedelia. Flore Benguigui's vocals are light and dreamy, yet commanding of your attention, while lyrics have a feminist touch. During their energetic live sets, L'Imp\u00e9ratrice members Charles de Boisseguin and Hagni Gwon (keys), David Gaugu\u00e9 (bass), Achille Trocellier (guitar), and Tom Daveau (drums) deliver extended instrumental jam sessions to expand and connect their music. Gaugu\u00e9 emphasizes the thick funky bass, and Benguigui jumps around the stage while sounding like an angel. L\u2019Imp\u00e9ratrice\u2019s latest album, 2021\u2019s Tako Tsubo, is a sunny, playful French disco journey. Franc Moody's bio fittingly describes their music as \"a soul funk and cosmic disco sound.\" The London outfit was birthed by friends Ned Franc and Jon Moody in the early 2010s, when they were living together and throwing parties in North London's warehouse scene. In 2017, the group grew to six members, including singer and multi-instrumentalist Amber-Simone. Their music feels at home with other electro-pop bands like fellow Londoners Jungle and Aussie act Parcels. While much of it is upbeat and euphoric, Franc Moody also dips into the more chilled, dreamy realm, such as the vibey, sultry title track from their recently released Into the Ether. The Rise Of Underground House: How Artists Like Fisher & Acraze Have Taken Tech House, Other Electronic Genres From Indie To EDC Photo: Steven Sebring interview \"One foot in the past and one foot into the future,\" Billy Idol says, describing his decade-spanning career in rock. \"We\u2019ve got the best of all possible worlds because that has been the modus operandi of Billy Idol.\" Living Legends is a series that spotlights icons in music still going strong today. This week, GRAMMY.com spoke with Billy Idol about his latest EP,\u00a0 Cage, and continuing to rock through decades of changing tastes. Billy Idol is a true rock 'n' roll survivor who has persevered through cultural shifts and personal struggles. While some may think of Idol solely for \"Rebel Yell\" and \"White Wedding,\" the singer's musical influences span genres and many of his tunes are less turbo-charged than his '80s hits would belie.\u00a0\u00a0 Idol first made a splash in the latter half of the '70s with the British punk band Generation X. In the '80s, he went on to a solo career combining rock, pop, and punk into a distinct sound that transformed him and his musical partner, guitarist Steve Stevens, into icons. They have racked up multiple GRAMMY nominations, in addition to one gold, one double platinum, and four platinum albums thanks to hits like \"Cradle Of Love,\" \"Flesh For Fantasy,\" and \"Eyes Without A Face.\"\u00a0 But, unlike many legacy artists, Idol is anything but a relic. Billy continues to produce vital Idol music by collaborating with producers and songwriters \u2014 including Miley Cyrus \u2014 who share his forward-thinking vision. He will play a five-show Vegas residency in November, and filmmaker Jonas Akerlund is working on a documentary about Idol\u2019s life.\u00a0 His latest release is Cage, the second in a trilogy of annual four-song EPs. The title track is a classic Billy Idol banger expressing the desire to free himself from personal constraints and live a better life. Other tracks on Cage incorporate metallic riffing and funky R&B grooves.\u00a0 Idol continues to reckon with his demons \u2014 they both grappled with addiction during the '80s \u2014 and the singer is open about those struggles on the record and the page. (Idol's 2014 memoir Dancing With Myself, details a 1990 motorcycle accident that nearly claimed a leg, and how becoming a father steered him to reject hard drugs. \"Bitter Taste,\" from his last EP, The Roadside, reflects on surviving the accident.) Although Idol and Stevens split in the late '80s \u2014 the skilled guitarist fronted Steve Stevens & The Atomic Playboys, and collaborated with Michael Jackson, Rick Ocasek, Vince Neil, and Harold Faltermeyer (on the GRAMMY-winning \"Top Gun Anthem\") \u2014\u00a0 their common history and shared musical bond has been undeniable. The duo reunited in 2001 for an episode of \"VH1 Storytellers\" and have been back in the saddle for two decades. Their union remains one of the strongest collaborations in rock 'n roll history. While there is recognizable personnel and a distinguishable sound throughout a lot of his work, Billy Idol has always pushed himself to try different things. Idol discusses his musical journey, his desire to constantly move forward, and the strong connection that he shares with Stevens.\u00a0 Steve has said that you like to mix up a variety of styles, yet everyone assumes you're the \"Rebel Yell\"/\"White Wedding\" guy. But if they really listen to your catalog, it's vastly different. Yeah, that's right. With someone like Steve Stevens, and then back in the day Keith Forsey producing... [Before that] Generation X actually did move around inside punk rock. We didn't stay doing just the Ramones two-minute music. We actually did a seven-minute song. [Laughs]. We did always mix things up.\u00a0 Then when I got into my solo career, that was the fun of it. With someone like Steve, I knew what he could do. I could see whatever we needed to do, we could nail it. The world was my oyster musically.\u00a0 \"Cage\" is a classic-sounding Billy Idol rocker, then \"Running From The Ghost\" is almost metal, like what the Devil's Playground album was like back in the mid-2000s. \"Miss Nobody\" comes out of nowhere with this pop/R&B flavor. What inspired that? We really hadn't done anything like that since something like \"Flesh For Fantasy\" [which] had a bit of an R&B thing about it. Back in the early days of Billy Idol, \"Hot In The City\" and \"Mony Mony\" had girls [singing] on the backgrounds.\u00a0 We always had a bit of R&B really, so it was actually fun to revisit that. We just hadn't done anything really quite like that for a long time. That was one of the reasons to work with someone like Sam Hollander [for the song \"Rita Hayworth\"] on The Roadside. We knew we could go [with him] into an R&B world, and he's a great songwriter and producer. That's the fun of music really, trying out these things and seeing if you can make them stick.\u00a0 I listen to new music by veteran artists and debate that with some people. I'm sure you have those fans that want their nostalgia, and then there are some people who will embrace the newer stuff. Do you find it\u2019s a challenge to reach people with new songs? Obviously, what we're looking for is, how do we somehow have one foot in the past and one foot into the future? We\u2019ve got the best of all possible worlds because that has been the modus operandi of Billy Idol.\u00a0 You want to do things that are true to you, and you don't just want to try and do things that you're seeing there in the charts today. I think that we're achieving it with things like \"Running From The Ghost\" and \"Cage\" on this new EP. I think we\u2019re managing to do both in a way.\u00a0 Obviously, \"Running From The Ghost\" is about addiction, all the stuff that you went through, and in \"Cage\" you\u2019re talking about\u00a0 freeing yourself from a lot of personal shackles. Was there any one moment in your life that made you really thought I have to not let this weigh me down anymore? I mean, things like the motorcycle accident I had, that was a bit of a wake up call way back. It was 32 years ago. But there were things like that, years ago, that gradually made me think about what I was doing with my life. I didn't want to ruin it, really. I didn't want to throw it away, and it made [me] be less cavalier.\u00a0 I had to say to myself, about the drugs and stuff, that I've been there and I've done it. There\u2019s no point in carrying on doing it. You couldn't get any higher. You didn't want to throw your life away casually, and I was close to doing that. It took me a bit of time, but then gradually I was able to get control of myself to a certain extent [with] drugs and everything. And I think Steve's done the same thing. We're on a similar path really, which has been great because we're in the same boat in terms of lyrics and stuff.\u00a0 So a lot of things like that were wake up calls. Even having grandchildren and just watching my daughter enlarging her family and everything; it just makes you really positive about things and want to show a positive side to how you're feeling, about where you're going. We've lived with the demons so long, we've found a way to live with them. We found a way to be at peace with our demons, in a way. Maybe not completely, but certainly to where we\u2019re enjoying what we do and excited about it. [When writing] \"Running From The Ghost\" it was easy to go, what was the ghost for us? At one point, we were very drug addicted in the '80s. And Steve in particular is super sober [now]. I mean, I still vape pot and stuff. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s doing it, but it\u2019s incredible. All I want to be able to do is have a couple of glasses of wine at a restaurant or something. I can do that now. I think working with people that are super talented, you just feel confident. That is a big reason why you open up and express yourself more because you feel comfortable with what's around you. Did you watch Danny Boyle's recent Sex Pistols mini-series? I did, yes. You had a couple of cameos; well, an actor who portrayed you did. How did you react to it? How accurate do you think it was in portraying that particular time period? I love Jonesy\u2019s book, I thought his book was incredible. It's probably one of the best bio books really. It was incredible and so open. I was looking forward to that a lot. It was as if [the show] kind of stayed with Steve [Jones\u2019 memoir] about halfway through, and then departed from it. [John] Lydon, for instance, was never someone I ever saw acting out; he's more like that today. I never saw him do something like jump up in the room and run around going crazy. The only time I saw him ever do that was when they signed the recording deal with Virgin in front of Buckingham Palace. Whereas Sid Vicious was always acting out; he was always doing something in a horrible way or shouting at someone. I don't remember John being like that. I remember him being much more introverted. But then I watched interviews with some of the actors about coming to grips with the parts they were playing. And they were saying, we knew punk rock happened but just didn't know any of the details. So I thought well, there you go. If [\"Pistol\" is]\u00a0 informing a lot of people who wouldn't know anything about punk rock, maybe that's what's good about it. Maybe down the road John Lydon will get the chance to do John's version of the Pistols story. Maybe someone will go a lot deeper into it and it won't be so surface. But maybe you needed this just to get people back in the flow. We had punk and metal over here in the States, but it feels like England it was legitimately more dangerous. British society was much more rigid. It never went [as] mega in America. It went big in England. It exploded when the Pistols did that interview with [TV host Bill] Grundy, that lorry truck driver put his boot through his own TV, and all the national papers had \"the filth and the fury\" [headlines]. We went from being unknown to being known overnight. We waited a year, Generation X. We even told them [record labels] no for nine months to a year. Every record company wanted their own punk rock group. So it went really mega in England, and it affected the whole country \u2013 the style, the fashions, everything. I mean, the Ramones were massive in England. Devo had a No. 1 song [in England] with \"Satisfaction\" in '77. Actually, Devo was as big as or bigger than the Pistols. You were ahead of the pop-punk thing that happened in the late '90s, and a lot of it became tongue-in-cheek by then. It didn't have the same sense of rebelliousness as the original movement. It was more pop. It had become a style. There was a famous book in England called Revolt Into Style \u2014 and that's what had happened, a revolt that turned into style which then they were able to duplicate in their own way. Even recently, Billie Joe [Armstrong] did his own version of \"Gimme Some Truth,\" the Lennon song we covered way back in 1977. When we initially were making [punk] music, it hadn't become accepted yet. It was still dangerous and turned into a style that people were used to. We were still breaking barriers. You have a band called Generation Sex with Steve Jones and Paul Cook. I assume you all have an easier time playing Pistols and Gen X songs together now and not worrying about getting spit on like back in the '70s? Yeah, definitely. When I got to America I told the group I was putting it together, \"No one spits at the audience.\" We had five years of being spat on [in the UK], and it was revolting. And they spat at you if they liked you. If they didn't like it they smashed your gear up. One night, I remember I saw blood on my T-shirt, and I think Joe Strummer got meningitis when spit went in his mouth. You had to go through a lot to become successful, it wasn't like you just kind of got up there and did a couple of gigs. I don't think some young rock bands really get that today. With punk going so mega in England, we definitely got a leg up. We still had a lot of work to get where we got to, and rightly so because you find out that you need to do that. A lot of groups in the old days would be together three to five years before they ever made a record, and that time is really important. In a way, what was great about punk rock for me was it was very much a learning period. I really learned a lot [about] recording music and being in a group and even writing songs. Then when I came to America, it was a flow, really. I also really started to know what I wanted Billy Idol to be. It took me a little bit, but I kind of knew what I wanted Billy Idol to be. And even that took a while to let it marinate. You and Miley Cyrus have developed a good working relationship in the last several years. How do you think her fans have responded to you, and your fans have responded to her? I think they're into it. It's more the record company that she had didn't really get \"Night Crawling\"\u2014 it was one of the best songs on Plastic Hearts, and I don't think they understood that. They wanted to go with Dua Lipa, they wanted to go with the modern, young acts, and I don't think they realized that that song was resonating with her fans. Which is a shame really because, with Andrew Watt producing, it's a hit song. But at the same time, I enjoyed doing it. It came out really good and it's very Billy Idol. In fact, I think it\u2019s more Billy Idol than Miley Cyrus. I think it shows you where Andrew Watt was. He was excited about doing a Billy Idol track. She's fun to work with. She\u2019s a really great person and she works at her singing \u2014 I watched her rehearsing for the Super Bowl performance she gave. She rehearsed all Saturday morning, all Saturday afternoon, and Sunday morning and it was that afternoon. I have to admire her fortitude. She really cares. I remember when you went on \"Viva La Bam\"\u00a0back in 2005 and decided to give Bam Margera\u2019s Lamborghini a new sunroof by taking a power saw to it. Did he own that car? Was that a rental? I think it was his car. Did he get over it later on? He loved it. [Laughs] He\u2019s got a wacky sense of humor. He\u2019s fantastic, actually. I\u2019m really sorry to see what he's been going through just lately. He's going through a lot, and I wish him the best. He's a fantastic person, and it's a shame that he's struggling so much with his addictions. I know what it's like. It's not easy. Musically, what is the synergy like with you guys during the past 10 years, doing Kings and Queens of the Underground and this new stuff? What is your working relationship like now in this more sober, older, mature version of you two as opposed to what it was like back in the '80s? In lots of ways it\u2019s not so different because we always wrote the songs together, we always talked about what we're going to do together. It was just that we were getting high at the same time.We're just not getting [that way now] but we're doing all the same things. We're still talking about things, still [planning] things:What are we going to do next? How are we going to find new people to work with? We want to find new producers. Let's be a little bit more timely about putting stuff out.That part of our relationship is the same, you know what I mean? That never got affected. We just happened to be overloading in the '80s. The relationship\u2019s\u2026 matured and it's carrying on being fruitful, and I think that's pretty amazing. Really, most people don't get to this place. Usually, they hate each other by now. [Laughs] We also give each other space. We're not stopping each other doing things outside of what we\u2019re working on together. All of that enables us to carry on working together. I love and admire him. I respect him. He's been fantastic. I mean, just standing there on stage with him is always a treat. And he\u2019s got an immensely great sense of humor. I think that's another reason why we can hang together after all this time because we've got the sense of humor to enable us to go forward. There's a lot of fan reaction videos online, and I noticed a lot of younger women like \"Rebel Yell\" because, unlike a lot of other '80s alpha male rock tunes, you're talking about satisfying your lover. It was about my girlfriend at the time, Perri Lister. It was about how great I thought she was, how much I was in love with her, and how great women are, how powerful they are. It was a bit of a feminist anthem in a weird way. It was all about how relationships can free you and add a lot to your life. It was a cry of love, nothing to do with the Civil War or anything like that. Perri was a big part of my life, a big part of being Billy Idol. I wanted to write about it. I'm glad that's the effect. Is there something you hope people get out of the songs you've been doing over the last 10 years? Do you find yourself putting out a message that keeps repeating? Well, I suppose, if anything, is that you can come to terms with your life, you can keep a hold of it. You can work your dreams into reality in a way and, look, a million years later, still be enjoying it. The only reason I'm singing about getting out of the cage is because I kicked out of the cage years ago. I joined Generation X when I said to my parents, \"I'm leaving university, and I'm joining a punk rock group.\" And they didn't even know what a punk rock group was. Years ago, I\u2019d write things for myself that put me on this path, so that maybe in 2022 I could sing something like \"Cage\" and be owning this territory and really having a good time. This is the life I wanted. The original UK punk movement challenged societal norms. Despite all the craziness going on throughout the world, it seems like a lot of modern rock bands are afraid to do what you guys were doing. Do you think we'll see a shift in that? Yeah.\u00a0 Art usually reacts to things, so I would think eventually there will be a massive reaction to the pop music that\u2019s taken over \u2014 the middle of the road music, and then this kind of right wing politics. There will be a massive reaction if there's not already one. I don\u2019t know where it will come from exactly. You never know who's gonna do [it]. Living Legends: Nancy Sinatra Reflects On Creating \"Power And Magic\" In Studio, Developing A Legacy Beyond \"Boots\" & The Pop Stars She Wants To Work With Graphic: The Recording Academy list The 2023 GRAMMY Award nominees for Best Country Solo Performance highlight country music's newcomers and veterans, featuring hits from Kelsea Ballerini, Zach Bryan, Miranda Lambert, Maren Morris and Willie Nelson. Country music's evolution is well represented in the 2023 GRAMMY nominees for Best Country Solo Performance. From crossover pop hooks to red-dirt outlaw roots, the genre's most celebrated elements are on full display \u2014 thanks to  rising stars, leading ladies and country icons. Longtime hitmaker Miranda Lambert delivered a soulful performance on the rootsy ballad \"In His Arms,\" an arrangement as sparing as the windswept west Texas highlands where she co-wrote the song. Viral newcomer Zach Bryan dug into similar organic territory on the Oklahoma side of the Red River for \"Something in the Orange,\" his voice accompanied with little more than an acoustic guitar. Two of country's 2010s breakout stars are clearly still shining, too, as Maren Morris and Kelsea Ballerini both received Best Country Solo Performance GRAMMY nods. Morris channeled the determination that drove her leap-of-faith move from Texas to Nashville for the playful clap-along \"Circles Around This Town,\" while Ballerini brought poppy hooks with a country edge on the infectiously upbeat \"HEARTFIRST.\" Rounding out the category is the one and only Willie Nelson, who paid tribute to his late friend Billy Joe Shaver with a cover of \"Live Forever\" \u2014 a fitting sentiment for the 89-year-old legend, who is approaching his eighth decade in the business.\u00a0 As the excitement builds for the 2023 GRAMMYs on Feb. 5, 2023, let's take a closer look at this year's nominees for Best Country Solo Performance. In the tradition of Shania Twain, Faith Hill and Carrie Underwood, Kelsea Ballerini represents Nashville's sunnier side \u2014 and her single \"HEARTFIRST\" is a slice of bright, uptempo, confectionary country-pop for the ages. Ballerini sings about leaning into a carefree crush with her heart on her sleeve, pushing aside her reservations and taking a risk on love at first sight. The scene plays out in a bar room and a back seat, as she sweeps nimbly through the verses and into a shimmering chorus, when the narrator decides she's ready to \"wake up in your T-shirt.\"\u00a0 There are enough steel guitar licks to let you know you're listening to a country song, but the story and melody are universal. \"HEARTFIRST\" is Ballerini's third GRAMMY nod, but first in the Best Country Solo Performance category. Zach Bryan blew into Music City seemingly from nowhere in 2017, when his original song \"Heading South\" \u2014 recorded on an iPhone \u2014 went viral. Then an active officer in the U.S. Navy, the Oklahoma native chased his muse through music during his downtime, striking a chord with country music fans on stark songs led by his acoustic guitar and affecting vocals. After his honorable discharge in 2021, Bryan began his music career in earnest, and in 2022 released \"Something in the Orange,\" a haunting ballad that stakes a convincing claim to the territory between Tyler Childers and Jason Isbell in both sonics and songwriting. Slashing slide guitar drives home the song's heartbreak, as Bryan pines for a lover whose tail lights have long since vanished over the horizon.\u00a0 \"Something In The Orange\" marks Bryan's first-ever GRAMMY nomination. Miranda Lambert is the rare, chart-topping contemporary country artist who does more than pay lip service to the genre's rural American roots. \"In His Arms\" originally surfaced on 2021's The Marfa Tapes, a casual recording Lambert made with Jack Ingram and Jon Randall in Marfa, Texas \u2014 a tiny arts enclave in the middle of the west Texas high desert. In this proper studio version \u2014 recorded for her 2022 album, Palomino \u2014 Lambert retains the structure and organic feel of the mostly acoustic song; light percussion and soothing atmospherics keep her emotive vocals front and center. A native Texan herself, Lambert sounds fully at home on \"In His Arms.\" Lambert is the only Best Country Solo Performance nominee who is nominated in all four Country Field categories in 2023. To date, Miranda Lambert has won 3 GRAMMYs and received 27 nominations overall.\u00a0 When Maren Morris found herself uninspired and dealing with writer's block, she went back to what inspired her to move to Nashville nearly a decade ago \u2014 and out came \"Circles Around This Town,\" the lead single from her 2022 album Humble Quest. Written in one of her first in-person songwriting sessions since the pandemic, Morris has called \"Circles Around This Town\" her \"most autobiographical song\" to date; she even recreated her own teenage bedroom for the song's video. As she looks back to her Texas beginnings and the life she left for Nashville, Morris' voice soars over anthemic, yet easygoing production.\u00a0 Morris last won a GRAMMY for Best Country Solo Performance in 2017, when her song \"My Church\" earned the singer her first GRAMMY. To date, Maren Morris has won one GRAMMY and received 17 nominations overall. Country music icon Willie Nelson is no stranger to the GRAMMYs, and this year he aims to add to his collection of 10 gramophones. He earned another three nominations for 2023 \u2014 bringing his career total to 56 \u2014 including a Best Country Solo Performance nod for \"Live Forever.\" Nelson's performance of \"Live Forever,\" the lead track of the 2022 tribute album Live Forever: A Tribute to Billy Joe Shaver, is a faithful rendition of Shaver's signature song. Still, Nelson puts his own twist on the tune, recruiting Lucinda Williams for backing vocals and echoing the melody with the inimitable tone of his nylon-string Martin guitar.\u00a0 Shaver, an outlaw country pioneer who passed in 2020 at 81 years old, never had any hits of his own during his lifetime. But plenty of his songs were still heard, thanks to stars like Elvis Presley, Kris Kristofferson and Waylon Jennings. Nelson was a longtime friend and frequent collaborator of Shaver's \u2014 and now has a GRAMMY nom to show for it. 2023 GRAMMY Nominations: See The Complete Nominees List Graphic: The Recording Academy news Ahead of Music's Biggest Night on Feb. 5, 2023, celebrate with this immersive playlist of every Latin Field nominee at the 2023 GRAMMYs.

Here's why he appeared in the first place. Ed Sheeran had one of the most talked-about cameos in Game of Thrones, and though the reason wasn't purely positive, the purpose of the appearance was good-natured. The singer/songwriter appeared in a season 7 episode of the HBO fantasy series based on the A Song of Ice and Fire novels by George R. R. Martin. Based on the show's history of using musicians as guest stars, Sheeran's presence wasn't a complete surprise, but the cameo didn't go as well as the singer had hoped. Luckily, the singer/songwriter has since been able to have a good sense of humor about the failed acting role, as Sheeran mocked his GOT cameo in Red Notice.  With appearances from Coldplay, Mastodon, and Bastille, the Ed Sheeran Game of Thrones cameo wasn't the only one, but his role was a bit more prominent than the rest. Sheeran played the role of Eddie in Game of Thrones season 7, episode 1, \"Dragonstone.\" Eddie was a member of the Lannister army that Arya encountered when traveling through the Riverlands. While Sheeran's character sang \"Hands of Gold,\" Arya joined them at the camp before sharing their distaste for King's Landing. Related: Game Of Thrones: How & Why Coldplay Cameoed At The Red Wedding The singer's immense popularity at the time was a major factor in the Ed Sheeran Game of Thrones cameo, but it was also done as a treat for a cast member. During a South by Southwest panel from 2017, Game of Thrones creators D.B. Weiss and David Benioff confirmed Sheeran's cameo came to be as a surprise for Maisie Williams, who played Arya. Since she was a major fan of the singer, Weiss and Benioff attempted to score the cameo for years, and it finally came to fruition for season 7. Rather than a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance, Sheeran was given a speaking part, including an opportunity to sing a song. Of course, Williams had to be involved in the sequence to carry out the cameo considering she was the driving force behind the casting. Despite only appearing in one episode of Game of Thrones, the fate of Sheeran's character was revealed in the poorly received Game of Thrones season 8. Eddie and fellow members of the Lannister army were present for the Battle of Goldroad, in which Daenerys found victory with the help of Drogon. According to prostitutes hired by Bronn, Eddie survived but suffered serious burns, including the loss of his eyelids. It's unclear if the legacy surrounding Sheeran's cameo led to Eddie's fate. Unfortunately, Sheeran's buzz-worthy Game of Thrones cameo didn't go well. There was a consensus that the scene felt out of place and the singer's acting wasn't up to the level the fans were used to seeing. More than anything, the moment felt more like fan service than anything meant to move the plot along. All in all, Sheeran's odd Game of Thrones cameo and song provided little to the show and might've even ended up being a hindrance to Game of Thrones as his role received harsh backlash. Criticism of the scene resulted in Sheeran deleting his Twitter account after constant harassment from those who mocked the cameo. Even actor Kristian Nairn, who plays Hodor in GoT, was deeply critical of the musician's appearance. Truly, it's never a good sign when cast members are wary of a particular celebrity cameo. Related: Game Of Thrones\u2019 Ending & Real Meaning Explained (In Detail) With House of the Dragon deep in its first season, Game of Thrones creators may be eager to add new celebrity cameos into the mix. Weiss and Benioff made a smart decision by keeping their celebrity appearances brief and primarily musicians, rather than big-name celebrities. That being said, the Game of Thrones spinoff series' creators might be wary of another Sheeran-esque disaster. Game of Thrones at least added an interesting layer to the special appearance by explaining Eddie's dire fate. The Ed Sheeran Game of Thrones cameo gets an unfairly bad rap. Especially when one considers how many musicians the series featured. The show is no stranger to musicians as a whole. Kristian Nairn, who plays Hodor, is a long-time guitar player and DJ. Alfie Allen, who portrays Theon Greyjoy, is the brother of popular British pop singer Lily Allen. In addition, the Hold Steady version of the Westerosi song \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\" appears in Game of Thrones season 3, episode 3, \"The Walk of Punishment.\" Either way, Ed Sheeran isn't the only musician to make an appearance in the popular medieval fantasy series.  In various episodes throughout seasons 4 and 5, Joel Fry of the alt-pop band Animal Circus appeared as the recurring character Hizdahr zo Loraq. The character was previously a slaveholder in Mereen, and was briefly betrothed to Daenerys Targaryen. Coldplay's drummer, Will Champion, shows up in the season 3 episode \"The Rains of Castamere,\" where he assists in playing the Westerosi song. The episode itself is infamously known as \"the Red Wedding.\" Dr. Feelgood's Wilko Johnson is in various episodes of seasons 1 and 2 as the man who executed Ned Stark, Ser Illyn Payne.

AMD has been the underdog in the semiconductor industry for years. Starting as a licensed chip manufacturer for giants like Intel, it wasn\u2019t a big name in the Silicon space for a while. It started making its own chips a bit after, but its first big break was when it introduced the first x86_64 chip in 2003, beating Intel to market. Since then, it has made some strides and started offering some competitive AMD processor options for buyers. Intel and AMD share a cross-licensing agreement under which Intel lets AMD make x86 CPUs, and AMD lets Intel use its x86_64 instruction set. Smaller fabrication processes are crucial with regards to CPUs since they allow manufacturers to pack in more performance in the same space and with better power consumption efficiency. In recent years, Intel has failed to offer processors made with smaller fabrication processes. As a result, AMD has started gaining market share with its CPUs, especially with the Ryzen range. While AMD offers a much more streamlined processor lineup than Intel, you may still need help understanding its offerings and picking the best AMD CPU for you. Here\u2019s our AMD CPU guide to help you with that. More: AMD vs Intel: Which one is better? AMD\u2019s naming convention for its processors is not very complicated. AMD offers two types of processors \u2014 CPUs and APUs. An APU, or an Accelerated Processing Unit, is just a marketing name that AMD uses for its CPUs that have integrated Radeon graphics. For the Ryzen lineup, the naming system includes the brand name and tier followed by the SKU number, and optionally, a suffix. The SKU number is four-digit and depends on the series. While there have been six generations of Ryzen CPUs, there have been seven series in total \u2014 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, and 7000. That\u2019s because AMD used the last Zen 3 architecture for two series \u2014 4000 and 5000. The 4000 series was entirely an APU lineup, and available only in laptops and OEM systems, unlike the 5000 series. The Zen 3 Plus-based 6000 series is again laptop-only. The SKU number begins with the first number of the series, making it easy to identify the processor. The second digit is a performance identifier; the higher, the better. AMD uses suffixes after the SKU number to help identify the other features of its processors. Here\u2019s a legend to the AMD processor SKU suffixes. Also see: AMD vs Nvidia \u2013 what\u2019s the best add-in GPU for you? AMD Ryzen is the company\u2019s most popular processor lineup of all time. After a rather low-key run in the market for a few years, AMD debuted its brand new Zen architecture with the Ryzen series of CPUs. Released in 2017, it has quickly become a solid alternative to Intel\u2019s Core lineup. The Ryzen lineup is now four generations down. Just like Intel\u2019s Core series, Ryzen also has four tiers, Ryzen 3, 5, 7, and 9. AMD Ryzen desktop chips are now at 7nm, while the laptop chips are at 6nm, both using TSMC\u2019s manufacturing, compared to Intel\u2019s 10nm process. It has also been making strides with its architectural improvements. This has strengthened AMD Ryzen CPUs as the preferred CPU choices you can make in several price brackets. AMD Ryzen 3 is the most affordable of the Ryzen series. The company offers some solid performance with these chips, and they fit nicely into budget performance PCs. Ryzen 3 chips are a good fit for affordable gaming PC builds, home PCs that can easily handle the basics, or something like a budget HTPC. The current Ryzen 3 lineup has a few interesting options. As mentioned before, the Zen 3-based 4000 series Ryzen lineup only had APU options. With the 5000 series, AMD has done the same for the Ryzen 3 series. Ryzen 3 series now has only two APU options with the latest generation architecture. Ryzen 3 CPU options are only available with the older Zen 2-based Ryzen 3000 chips released in April 2020 \u2014 some of the last Zen 2 Ryzen CPU releases we saw. It makes sense that AMD would want to offer integrated graphics as a standard feature with Ryzen 3 chips since these are budget offerings. If you want to buy the best AMD Ryzen 3 processor right now, the best option would be the AMD Ryzen 3 3300X. AMD hasn\u2019t made a retail version of the Ryzen 3 with the 5000, 6000, or 7000 series, so this is your best bet. AMD Ryzen 3 3300X \u2014 Our AMD Ryzen 3 CPU recommendation AMD Ryzen 5 is a solid middle-ground for those looking for a processor that can perform well without costing too much. It\u2019s the best CPU series for most people. Ryzen 5 is perfect for mid-range systems like affordable workstations or gaming systems that don\u2019t go all out. With the Zen 4 7000 series, Ryzen 5 got even more powerful. AMD currently has one series 7000 CPU for the Ryzen 5. This Ryzen 5 offers six cores and 12 threads. The Ryzen 5 range is geared towards those looking for the most performance from an AMD processor, without spending too much on the higher-end versions. See also: AMD GPU guide AMD Ryzen 5 7600X \u2014 Our AMD Ryzen 5 CPU recommendation AMD Ryzen 7 is the former flagship CPU range from AMD. It offers high-performance processors for workstations, content creation rigs, and high-end gaming systems. If you\u2019re looking for a high-end AMD Ryzen processor but don\u2019t want to spend a ton on only the CPU, Ryzen 7 is a perfect choice. AMD\u2019s streamlined lineup means you get limited options, as you do with Ryzen 5. With the Ryzen 7 7000 series, AMD offers a single CPU option. The Ryzen 7 has eight cores and 16 threads. It provides a higher maximum TDP at 105W to power all that silicon. AMD Ryzen 7 7700X \u2014 Our AMD Ryzen 7 CPU recommendation AMD Ryzen 9 offers the maximum performance in the Ryzen series. It\u2019s the flagship lineup of the Ryzen brand, and it packs in just about all the features you could get from a consumer CPU at this point. For gaming systems and content creation rigs made to handle the most intense workloads, Ryzen 9 is the right choice. High-performance CPUs are unlikely to be used without a dedicated GPU. Even so, AMD has included graphics to its latest high-end processors. AMD offers two CPU options, with different core configurations. You can either go for a 12-core, 24-thread CPU or max it out with the 16-core, 32-thread option. AMD Ryzen 9 7950X \u2014 Our AMD Ryzen 9 CPU recommendation AMD\u2019s high-performance lineup doesn\u2019t stop at the Ryzen 9 series. AMD Ryzen Threadripper has some of the beefiest and most insanely overpowered processors you can buy. AMD calls it the most powerful desktop processor in the world. It certainly backs that claim with the level of performance it offers. While AMD\u2019s Ryzen chips max out at a 170W TDP, AMD doesn\u2019t hold back with the Ryzen Threadripper lineup. You get a max TDP of up to 280W, and a whopping 64 cores and 128 threads. Ryzen Threadripper processors are also quite huge in size compared to the Ryzen chips. The extra room goes for all the additional silicon and core configurations. See also: Arm vs x86 \u2014 Everything you need to know Currently, you only get Zen 2-based 3000 series Threadripper processors. These are very powerful and use the 7nm TSMC process. Threadipper got a Zen 3 refresh, but all the offerings are OEM-only for now, and you can\u2019t purchase them directly. Then there are the Threadripper Pros, but those are likely overkill for most readers here. AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X \u2014 Our AMD Ryzen Threadripper CPU recommendation AMD Athlon was the Intel Pentium-equivalent brand of yesteryear. The company now uses the brand to fill out the lower end of the budget PC market. Athlon is an excellent choice for super low-budget builds that need to do the bare basics, like web browsing. AMD now only offers APUs in the Athlon lineup. It has three tiers. These are Pro, Gold, and Silver, but those are only meant for OEM systems. For the consumers, you get only one retail version. AMD Athlon 3000G \u2014 Our AMD Althon processor recommendation AMD has a few other processor lineups that target the enterprise end of the market. While AMD\u2019s consumer strategy works well for it, it has also made some serious strides in the enterprise space. AMD Pro is actually an umbrella brand for several series of AMD processors meant for the enterprise market. Ryzen, Threadripper, and Athlon all have their own Pro series offerings. AMD promises a focus on security with these processors. Security features include AMD Memory Guard for real-time encryption of system memory and AMD Shadow Stack hardware-level protection against control-flow attacks. There are also more implementations from OEMs and some OS-level features in Windows 10. You also get enterprise-grade support. AMD Epyc is the company\u2019s lineup of server CPUs, available only in OEM server systems. The Epyc lineup takes the capabilities you can see in the Threadripper series and scales it up to meet the heavy requirements of the server market. AMD has two series in the EPYC lineup, the 7002 series, and the 7003 series. The AMD Epyc 7002 series is the Zen 2-based platform, and the 7003 is the latest Zen 3-based server CPU lineup. You get up to 64 cores and 128 threads, and TDPs go up to 280W. AMD also offers embedded solutions for a variety of low-power and space-constrained applications. AMD\u2019s Epyc and Ryzen platforms both have embedded versions. Epyc has three embedded chip series \u2014 the 3000 series for affordable server applications, the 7001 series based on Zen architecture, and the 7002 series based on Zen 2. There\u2019s no Zen 3 embedded Epyc series yet. Ryzen gets multiple embedded CPU lineups, the most prominent being the performance-focused R-series and the low-power G-series. More: What is an SoC? Everything you need to know AMD seems prepared on all fronts when it comes to its processor strategy. It has a more streamlined set of offerings than Intel, as seen in this AMD CPU guide. It is quickly becoming the preferred CPU brand for more and more folks. AMD has no plans of slowing down. Despite the disruption of the global semiconductor supply chain, TSMC has announced that it\u2019s on track for its 4nm and 3nm processes to hit in 2022, with 2nm in development. AMD is likely to be on board for the ride. We can see it go to smaller and smaller manufacturing processes in the coming years as Intel tries to catch up. There are already rumors about future AMD processor generations on these smaller processes. AMD has already released the Zen 4-based Ryzen 7000 series, which use TSMC\u2019s 5nm process. Even if you choose to ignore the possible newer and upcoming prospects, AMD is doing pretty well. The 5000 series Ryzen CPUs are some of the best value you can get right now, and AMD\u2019s sales show that the consumer market is swaying towards team red\u2019s offerings. AMD has also recently acquired Xilinx \u2014 a big name in the FPGA and networking business. That\u2019s a potential goldmine for AMD in terms of diversification. AMD has had a flip-flop pattern in the past, where they do well for a few years but then lose steam. However, it has never bounced up this well, and if it keeps doing what it has been doing in recent years, there\u2019s no stopping AMD. For consumers, that can only be a good thing as Intel is also competing harder, now that the stakes are higher than ever.

It was back in the Myspace days, when he had a standing offer to turn up in any living room that would have him, and he thinks it was at a student house for maybe 20 kids. He then uncorks the opening chords to The A Team in front of a crowd reported to be the largest ever assembled for a show in Wales. Sheeran is a numbers guy. Tonight\u2019s milestone is minor next to the figures put up by his \u00f7 tour, which ran for more than 250 shows between 2017 and 2019 and ended up the highest grossing and best attended of all time. But his everyman shtick remains effective because of his ordinary look: a busker\u2019s mien of big rhythmic strumming, casual clothes and a happy-to-be-here expression. Performing in the round, ringed by an enormous screen and a scattering of plectrum-shaped sub-arrays that flicker between show footage and the artwork of his most recent LP, =, he runs laps of the stage, stopping off periodically at any one of five loop stations scattered around its circumference. The outer segment spins, giving each corner of the stadium their moment with Ed. It\u2019s a clever, egalitarian move, allowing for a responsive back and forth that suits him better than the pyro and fireworks that bookend the set. It also permits him to throw a few curveballs without messing up the DNA of a Sheeran show. There is a weight of expectation on his loop-based setup, with each element of a song assembled on the fly night after night, but it is a stifling way to work. He clearly delights in the creativity involved, yet it can be numbing, like a virtuoso guitarist entering the fifth minute of a complex solo. Perhaps recognising this, for the first time he has brought a band with him: two guitarists, a bassist, keys and drums. They assist roughly a third of the set from pods orbiting the main stage, leaving Sheeran in the spotlight and preserving the loops as a draw, but also helping certain songs to evolve. At least, that\u2019s the idea. Opening with Tides and Blow, they conjure a surprising amount of rock heft that is undone by the grating rumble of the badly mixed bass and kick drum. It\u2019s a problem that persists, claiming everything from the Bruce Springsteen pastiche Overpass Graffiti to a medley of collaborations and Thinking Out Loud, which is roared back with gusto regardless. Largely, Sheeran\u2019s songs are templates \u2013 folk Ed, pop-house Ed, ballad Ed \u2013 with different colours daubed between the lines. The unflattering mix lays this bare, but his voice cuts through the noise. During Perfect, delivered before a sea of phone lights and couples slow-dancing on the floor, quibbles melt away: it\u2019s easy to sling rocks at music this pat and sentimental, but it\u2019s hard to argue with its resonance. Whether it\u2019s a dozen of them arranged in a uni house or 75,000 in a stadium, Sheeran\u2019s songs matter to people, and that\u2019s truly disarming."], "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/30/ed-sheeran-copyright-trial-thinking-out-loud-marvin-gaye-lets-get-it-on": [" Singer accused of copying his 2014 hit song Thinking Out Loud from Marvin Gaye classic Ed Sheeran will stand trial in the US over claims he copied his hit 2014 song Thinking Out Loud from Marvin Gaye\u2019s Let\u2019s Get It On, after a federal judge rejected the pop star\u2019s efforts to toss out the long-running copyright case. Sheeran\u2019s lawyers had argued that the lawsuit was invalid because the elements that were similar in the two songs were not unique enough to be covered by copyright in the first place. They cited a number of other songs, including The Temptations\u2019 Since I Lost My Baby, as examples of tracks with similar elements. But the US district judge Louis Stanton said there was \u201cno bright-line rule\u201d for deciding such questions, and Sheeran would need to face a jury of his peers. The judge cited a disagreement between musical experts as a reason for his decision. \u201cAlthough the two musical compositions are not identical, a jury could find that the overlap between the songs\u2019 combination of chord progression and harmonic rhythm is very close,\u201d Stanton said. The civil trial will take place in Manhattan \u2013 a date has yet to be set \u2013 and is expected to be high-profile. In April, Sheeran was cleared of copying in his chart-topping 2017 track Shape of You, in a separate case in London. The claim over Thinking Out Loud was originally lodged in 2018 by a company called Structured Asset Sales (SAS), which acquired a portion of the estate of Ed Townsend, who co-wrote Let\u2019s Get It On. It sought $100m (\u00a390m) in damages, alleging that Sheeran and his co-writer Amy Wadge \u201ccopied and exploited, without authorisation or credit,\u201d the 1973 Gaye song, \u201cincluding but not limited to the melody, rhythms, harmonies, drums, bass line, backing chorus, tempo, syncopation and looping\u201d. Stanton ruled that jurors must decide whether SAS can include concert revenue in damages, rejecting Sheeran\u2019s argument that ticket sales were not tied to the alleged infringement. Sheeran\u2019s 2014-15 tour brought in $150m in gross revenue, according to the music industry trade publication Pollstar. This is not the only trial Sheeran is facing over Thinking Out Loud, which went to No 1 in the UK and spent 51 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 after it was released in 2014. SAS has filed a second case, which is on pause, while a separate suit by another portion of Townsend\u2019s estate is awaiting trial. An attorney for SAS, Hillel Parness, said the company was pleased with the ruling. At the Shape of You trial in London in March, Sheeran and his co-writers John McDaid and Steven McCutcheon faced accusations that a hook on their track ripped off Oh Why, a 2015 song by Sami Chokri and Ross O\u2019Donoghue. After a high court judge ruled in Sheeran\u2019s favour, the singer said he hoped it would put an end to \u201cfuture baseless claims\u201d, which he said were \u201cdamaging to the songwriting industry\u201d.

Last but not the least, this CPU is built with a fairly old 12 nm TSMC process for below average energy efficiency. The AMD Ryzen 5 3550H is a mobile SoC that was announced in January 2019. It combines four Zen+ cores (8 threads) clocked at 2.1 GHz to 3.7 GHz with a Radeon RX Vega 8 graphics adapter with 8 CUs (512 Shaders) clocked at up to 1,200 MHz. Compared to the similar Ryzen 5 3500U, the 3550H offers a 20 Watt higher TDP and therefore a better performance under long periods of load. The integrated dual-channel memory controller supports up to DDR4-2400 memory.

But alongside PCIe and NVMe, SATA is still a significant player, especially when it comes to larger-sized HDDs and SSDs. That may be a little confusing so read on to learn more about SATA, and don\u2019t forget to check out our guide to what SSDs are, as well as our guide on some of the best SSDs available today. Although there is a myriad of computer products that are designated as SATA devices,\u00a0the reason they are called that is that they use the SATA interface. In other words, your PC connects through two SATA ports, one on the drive and another on the motherboard. Although SATA connectors are described as a single port or connector, SATA encompasses two ports: The data connector and the power connector. The former is the short, L-shaped, seven-pin connector, while the latter is the more extended 15-pin connector \u2014 the taller \u201cL\u201d of the two. Both connectors are typically reversed on the drives they allow connections for, with the bases of their respective \u201cL\u201d shapes facing one another. Beyond length, they can be told apart by the cables that connect to them. Where the SATA data cable is usually made up of solid plastic, which extends into a flat, single-band cable, the SATA power connector will continue from its head to multiple, thin, rounded wires of different colors. Both cables are required for SATA devices to work, and both do different jobs. The data cable provides the high-speed connection to the rest of the computer, transferring information back and forth as requested, while the power cable is what gives the drive the electricity to run in the first place. Although most PCs in recent years have used SATA devices, there are a few different types that are worth noting. SATA was first introduced in 2000, replacing the aged PATA ribbon cables. It was revised in 2003 and again in 2004 and 2008, bringing SATA to version three, commonly referred to as SATA III or 3.0. These standards increased speed and added additional features to allow for faster and more reliable storage drives, but didn\u2019t change the physical look of the SATA connector itself. SATA III is the most common SATA interface used today, though there have been five revisions since its introduction, namely 3.1 through 3.5. In Revision 3.1, SATA focused on improving the performance of SSDs, allowing host PCs to identify the capacity of their hardware devices and the port that made USBs possible, the Universal Storage Module (USM). Improvements for Revision 3.2 included slimming down the USM, incorporating micro SSD to shrink the size of storage components, adding USB 3.0 ports, and reducing power requirements for devices in constant operation. Revision 3.3 offered users greater choice and flexibility, with staggered startup options and an activity indicator, as well as improved data center maintenance and hard drive disc space. SATA\u2019s 2018 update, Revision 3.4, added improvements like SATA device temperature monitoring, writing critical cache data, and enhanced compatibility with manufacturers, all while minimizing the impact on how your PC operates. The 2020 update to revision 3.5 gives the host device better control of the order in which commands are processed and reduces latency to boost performance. There have been a few alternative SATA interfaces over the years, like mSATA for laptop drives, which debuted in 2011. The latest generation of that technology was the M.2 standard. Currently, the fastest drives have moved beyond the mSATA interface and now take advantage of PCI Express ports for higher performance. First introduced with SATA 3.2 in 2013, SATA Express allowed for cross-compatibility with SATA III and PCI Express drives. Still, it wasn\u2019t a popular choice while eSATA offered SATA-like speeds for external drives. Today, most high-speed external drives use USB 3.0 connections, commonly with the Type-C standard of the connector. In 2008 SATA was the standard for PC and laptop hard drives and SSDs however we are now moving beyond SATA. Of particular interest are M.2 drives that support the latest NVMe protocol. These SSDS offer the maximum level of performance and hence they appeal to enthusiasts who value performance above everything else. M.2 and NVMe drives are not restricted by those skinny SATA data cables and as a result, they are able to deliver better performance. Add in the benefits of a PCI Express 4.0 interface and you find the current crop of SSDs, such as the\u00a0 Samsung 980 Pro, have a data transfer speed of 7GBps. That is equivalent to more than 50Gbps which outperforms the hard SATA III limit of 6Gbps by a huge margin. When you buy a new motherboard, you can be confident it will be supplied with a handful of SATA cables that will ensure the fastest SATA III connection. However, if you find you are connecting a SATA drive to an exisiting PC you might end up using an adapter cable of one sort or another, which can be a decent approach if you use appropriate hardware. On the other hand, if you use a SATA adapter that connects to USB you may well find your connection speed is restricted, so we strongly recommend you use a native SATA III cable whenever possible.

Maryland fans Saturday night couldn\u2019t have been happier with that decision during his sold-out concert\u00a0at the Merriweather\u00a0Post Pavilion\u00a0in Columbia \u2013 one of the stops on his worldwide tour. Sir Elton with Swift convinced Sheeran to put the hip-hop song disco-esque, \u201cSing\u201d on his latest effort. He could risk alienating those fans who discovered him in those teen-idol magazines. He could lose that fan base who had fallen in love with his acoustic soul and soft musical touches displayed on the heart-wrenching \u201cA Team,\u201d \u00a0a song about a crack-addicted prostitute. It was a risk worth taking. Sheeran coming off his mainstream mega-hit \u201cA Team\u201d recorded\u00a0his second album \u201cMultiply\u201d better known as \u201cX\u201d that displays \u00a0his musical versatility with emotional songs like \u201cOne\u201d written on a guitar made out of a whiskey bottle in a hotel room while on tour in Perth\u00a0in 2011. The album also features \u00a0a rapping \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d \u00a0about a girlfriend cheating on him with a close friend. He played them both to a rain-soaked Columbia crowd. His latest album showed he is more than a one-hit wonder and someone who can attract more than just screaming teenage girls. How often are you going to get an acoustic guitar-rapping performance mixed with sentimental love ballads and rocking pop songs? Sheeran has a tune for everyone in his \u00a0repertoire as evident on his chart-rising album. The album was released June 20, in Australia and New Zealand and then June 23 through\u00a0Asylum Records\u00a0and\u00a0Atlantic Records.  After a\u00a0week, \u201cMultiply\u201d charted at No. 1 in 12 countries and reached the top five in 11 other countries. The song \u201cSing,\u201d inspired by Sheeran\u2019s taking a liking to JT\u2019s Justified, soared through the charts and probably will earn him a Grammy if his latest album doesn\u2019t. \u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s \u00a0his first single to be No. 1 in the United Kingdom.  Sheeran, a British version of \u00a0the American musician\u00a0Howie Day (Collide) with all the loops and pedals effects, covered most of his latest album along with a few tunes from his first commercial offering such as the rocking\u00a0\u201cGive Me Love,\u201d \u00a0that pleased a rain-soaked crowd. Umbrellas in hand, the crowd\u00a0braved the downpour,\u00a0the thunderstorms and the lightening that seemed like a 4th of July fireworks show, while dancing, and singing along with the 23-year-old Brit from\u00a0Hebden Bridge. The rain couldn\u2019t stop Sheeran from pouring out his soul from songs like, \u201cYou need me, I don\u2019t need you.\u201d  He may be one of the few single-act musicians who can captivate and hold 20,000 fans of all ages mesmerized with a vocal range that handles the lows to the falsettos in such rare fashion. He doesn\u2019t just play music but he engages \u00a0his fans \u2013 holds conversations and gets them to sing if they know the words or as he says, if you don\u2019t \u201cjust make them up.\u201d And then he lies to them sweetly \u2013 telling them they are all in tune. After two beers, everyone is in perfect harmony. And when he wants them to \u00a0hear a heart-warming tune that demands silence \u2013 he just says \u2013 no singing \u2013 just \u201cchill.\u201d And the fans do just that and then scream afterwards about how much they love him. Sheeran also frequently joked\u00a0with the fans at Merriweather \u2013 often stopping to take photographs of the crowd. The only groan\u00a0you could hear is when he said the song, \u00a0\u201cI See Fire,\u201d from The Hobbit\u00a0was\u00a0his last tune for the night. Yeah, right. But those familiar with his songs, knew that he couldn\u2019t get away with that. He hadn\u2019t played \u201cA Team\u201d or \u201cSing\u201d yet \u2013 and he came back and closed with those hits \u2013 ending about a two-hour performance that had the crowd leaving the concert singing as they walked out and are probably still singing as they woke up this morning. That\u2019s something he made his fans promise to do when they got up in the morning. Sheeran\u2019s return to Maryland comes on the heels of his performance earlier this summer at Power Plant Live in Baltimore, when his record had just hit the charts and was starting to create a worldwide buzz.\u00a0 That performance followed the special Grammy Night when he was one of many artists who saluted the Beatles. Sheeran played John Lennon\u2019s \u201cIn My Life,\u201d to honor the Fab Four. It would have been fun to have seen him play that tune live at one of his concerts. \u00a0But it\u2019s something he rarely does \u2013 plays covers during his concerts that promote his own albums. But why not just throw the audience a special treat similar to what he has done at ITunes Festivals or in the Live Lounge BBC Radio 1\u00a0such as playing Sam Smith\u2019s Stay with Me, or Snow Patrols\u2019 Chasing Cars, or even The Fault in our\u00a0Stars from the movie of the same name.  Maybe 2,000 fans saw that special July gig at Power Plant Live, which was more of an intimate-outdoor setting than the Merriweather performance and maybe a little offsetting with a bit too many screaming young girls drowning out some of his more sensitive music with screams of \u201cI love you Eddie!\u201d And, of course, that begged the question, could his one-man act work for a larger venue in the United States. The answer is yes. And there\u2019s no turning back for him now. \u00a0OK, those young girls are still professing their love to the icon, but we will live with that for now. He may find out as Howie Day has learned that, it just might be too difficult for him to bring a band on tour with fans screaming for him to just be himself with his loops and effects, and big-screen shots of his intricate guitar playing. In other words \u2013 leave the band at home for now. Sheeran\u2019s handlers advised him that every song released on X would have to be played by himself with no back-up band. And he did just that \u2013 quite soulful with an array of guitars \u2013 he tends to like the smaller-size Martin guitars for grip and the fingerboard. \u00a0(LX1E Ed Sheeran Signature Edition)\u00a0 His performance was quite amazing when you consider some of his songs like Sing seem to cry out for a band. Sheeran told reporters he\u2019s not quite ready to tour with a band. It\u2019s not that he needs \u201ccontrol\u201d he says, but he has so much more to accomplish and explore by himself. Glad to hear that, but it would be nice to see him at some point go back to a more intimate setting with just a few hundred fans. Those days, however are probably long gone. \u00a0 \u00a0 Timothy W.

Born in Halifax, West Yorkshire and raised in Framlingham, Suffolk, he began writing songs around the age of eleven. In early 2011, Sheeran independently released the extended play, No. 5 Collaborations Project. He signed with Asylum Records the same year.\n Sheeran's debut album, + (pronounced \"plus\"), was released in September 2011 and topped the UK Albums Chart. It contained his first hit single \"The A Team\". In 2012, Sheeran won the Brit Awards for Best British Male Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act. Sheeran's second studio album, \u00d7 (pronounced \"multiply\"), topped charts around the world upon its release in June 2014. It was named the second-best-selling album worldwide of 2015. In the same year, \u00d7 won Album of the Year at the 2015 Brit Awards, and he received the Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. A single from \u00d7, \"Thinking Out Loud\", earned him the 2016 Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance.\n Sheeran's third album, \u00f7 (pronounced \"divide\"), was released in March 2017, and was the best-selling album worldwide of 2017. The first two singles from the album, \"Shape of You\" and \"Castle on the Hill\", broke records in a number of countries by debuting in the top two positions of the charts. He also became the first artist to have two songs debut in the US top 10 in the same week. By March 2017, Sheeran had accumulated ten top 10 singles from \u00f7 on the UK Singles Chart, breaking the record for most top 10 UK singles from one album. His fourth single from \u00f7, \"Perfect\", reached number one in the US, Australia and the UK, where it became the Christmas number one in 2017. The world's best-selling artist of 2017, he was named the Global Recording Artist of the Year. Released in 2019, his fourth studio album No.6 Collaborations Project debuted at number one in most major markets, and spawned three UK number one singles, \"I Don't Care\", \"Beautiful People\" and \"Take Me Back to London\". His fifth studio album, = (pronounced \"equals\"), topped the charts in most major markets in 2021.\n Sheeran has sold more than 150 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists.[2] He has 101 million RIAA-certified units in the US,[3] and two of his albums are in the list of the best-selling albums in UK chart history. In December 2019, the Official Charts Company named him artist of the decade, with the most combined success in the UK album and singles charts in the 2010s.[4] Globally, Spotify named him the second most streamed artist of the decade.[4] Beginning in March 2017, his \u00f7 Tour became the highest-grossing of all time in August 2019. An alumnus of the National Youth Theatre in London, Sheeran's acting roles include appearing in the 2019 film Yesterday.\n Edward Christopher Sheeran was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England on 17 February 1991.[6][7] His early childhood home was on Birchcliffe Road in nearby Hebden Bridge.[8] His father was a curator at Cartwright Hall in Bradford and his mother worked at Manchester City Art Gallery.[8] In December 1995 he moved with his family from Hebden Bridge to Framlingham in Suffolk,[9][10] where he attended the independent Brandeston Hall preparatory school (now Framlingham College Prep School),[11][12][13] then Thomas Mills High School, also in Framlingham.[14][15] He has an older brother named Matthew, who works as a composer.[16] Sheeran's parents, John and Imogen, are from London.

I remember him walking on stage with this rainbow-coloured Stratocaster and playing the first riff of 'Layla'. I was hooked. Two days later I bought a black Stratocaster copy for \u00a330 that came with an amp. All I did for the next month was try to play that 'Layla' riff.\"[199]\n In a complicated world, Sheeran\u2019s musical modus operandi is straightforward; to create well-crafted, expertly vague songs that unite people. His songs are vessels broad enough to soundtrack both a first dance and a funeral procession, a gut-punch break-up and a trawl around a harshly lit shopping centre. They\u2019re for life\u2019s big moments, with all the cinematic edge of a Richard Curtis film. He\u2019s also malleable \u2013 when he\u2019s done with hip-hop, for example, he doesn\u2019t need an image overhaul to then revert to balladry. If one genre isn\u2019t to your tastes, then fear not, another will be along soon. Sheeran has also cited The Beatles, Nizlopi and Eminem as his biggest musical influences.[201][202] He is also a fan of heavier music and cites bands such as Cradle of Filth, Slipknot, Korn, Marilyn Manson and Bring Me the Horizon as other influences.[203][204] As a teenager, he also had a Kerrang! subscription.[205] According to Sheeran, he had a stutter in his speech when he was younger, and he credited rapping along to Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP for helping him stammer less.[206] He was also inspired by \"Cannonball\" singer-songwriter Damien Rice in 2002, with Sheeran stating, \"seeing him play this small club in Ireland, I was able to meet him, and he was unbelievably cool. I went straight home and started writing songs. I would not be doing what I'm doing now if he'd been a jerk.\"[207] He also played the guitar to Westlife's Greatest hits album when he was ten, citing them as one of his influences.[208][209] Sheeran collaborated with his idol Eric Clapton in April 2016, with Sheeran stating to People magazine, \"I sang on Eric Clapton's album I Still Do. It's one thing having him on mine, but being on his, that's an honour that you can't ever pinpoint on how great that is. I did something for his record, and I was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso,' appearing as a guest on Clapton's \"I Will Be There\", in addition to performing the song with Clapton on stage, and he did something for my record performing a guitar solo on \"Dive\" on Sheeran's album \u00f7 and was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso.'\"[23] Sheeran also cited Taylor Swift as one of his influences, suggesting in 2015 their respective success drives each other on.[210]\n In March 2015, Sheeran announced he was setting up a record label, Gingerbread Man Records, which is a deal with Warner Music Group.[211] The label was launched in August 2015 alongside its accompanying YouTube channel.[212] Jamie Lawson, the label's first signee, met Sheeran while they were both in London's folk circuit.[213] Lawson released his self-titled debut album on 9 October 2015, which has earned him a number one in the UK Albums Chart.[214] Sheeran signed his second artist, Foy Vance, in November 2015.[215] Maisie Peters also signed with the label in 2021.[216]\n On 29 September 2019, Sheeran announced he was teaming up with his manager Stuart Camp to open a bar located on Portobello Road in Notting Hill. The bar is called \"Bertie Blossoms\", and named after his wife Cherry Seaborn.[217]\n Sheeran performed a gig in Bristol, which raised \u00a340,000 for a charity that reaches out to street sex workers. \"It's good to show insight that these people are real people with real emotions and they deserve the same charity work as anyone else,\" Sheeran said. \"There's a lot more popular charities that get a lot of attention. And with certain subjects like this they're often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve.\" Tickets were available to those taking part in the charity's Give it up for One25 campaign by giving something up for 125 hours and hitting the \u00a340,000 fundraising mark.[218]\n Sheeran frequently gives away his clothes to charity shops around Suffolk, his home county.[219] An ambassador for East Anglia's Children's Hospice, he has donated clothes to the St Elizabeth Hospice charity shop in his home town Framlingham, including eight bags of clothes to the shop in February 2014.[220] In 2016 he donated 13 bags of clothes to the shop.[221] The tartan shirt worn by Sheeran when he met Renee Zellweger's character, Bridget, in Bridget Jones's Baby, was auctioned online to raise further funds for the hospice.[221]\n On 15 November 2014, Sheeran joined the charity supergroup Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the West African Ebola virus epidemic.[222]\n In November 2015, Sheeran supported the No Cold Homes campaign by the UK charity, Turn2us.[223] Sheeran was one of nearly thirty celebrities, which included Helen Mirren, Jeremy Irons and Hugh Laurie, to donate items of winter clothing to the campaign, with the proceeds used to help people in the country struggling to keep their home warm in winter.[224]\n Sheeran teamed up with the cast of the BBC3 mockumentary sitcom People Just Do Nothing to perform a charity single for the BBC's biennial telethon Comic Relief which aired in March 2017.[225] He appeared in a November 2017 episode of Gogglebox along with other UK celebrities such as Ozzy Osbourne, former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn as part of Channel 4 and Cancer Research UK's Stand Up to Cancer fundraising campaign.[226]\n In December 2019, he launched his own music foundation, Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation (ESSMF). In the statement, Sheeran stated it will help artists aged under 18 with \"small but hopefully useful grants\".[227] In May 2020, Sheeran donated \u00a3170,000 to his former school Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham, Suffolk. The donations, which have been made over a two-year period via the Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation, helped the school to purchase items such as MacBooks, cameras and a photography darkroom.[228] The same month, Sheeran made a donation to Ipswich Hospital.[229] In June 2020, Sheeran made a \"founding gift\" to launch Suffolk Community Foundation's \"Rebuilding Local Lives Appeal\" in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on the celebration day of the county, \"Suffolk Day\". Sheeran has donated over \u00a31 million to local charities in Suffolk amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including to a children's hospital ward.[230]\n Sheeran's parents organised The Ed Sheeran Made in Suffolk Legacy Auction on 23 October 2020 which ran until 8 November. The auction had 220 lots, including items donated by other celebrities such as David Beckham, Kylie Minogue and Usain Bolt. Sheeran has donated some of his personal items including handwritten lyrics from his song \"Perfect\", lego bricks he played with as a kid, handmade You Need Me EP from 2009 and a \u00a33 ticket to his first gig at the British Legion in Framlingham. The auction was made to raise money for Suffolk charities such as GeeWizz and Zest who both support children and young adults in the county, including redeveloping a playground for kids with special educational needs and disabilities in Ipswich. In November Sheeran sold one of his paintings, marking the first and only time his art has been made available for sale, which he titled \"Dab 2 2020\", to the same auction.[231] Later that month, Sheeran backed footballer Marcus Rashford's free school meals campaign and opened his own breakfast club at his Notting Hill restaurant, Bertie Blossoms. He announced on his Instagram that he provided hot breakfasts for \"anyone who is normally entitled to a free school meal or who is struggling in these strange times\".[232] Sheeran's charity, the Framlingham Foundation Trust, is reported to have donated money to give a primary school teacher to take an imperative course to help children create songs with untraditional instruments which will benefit children with learning difficulties.[233]\n Sheeran made his acting debut in 2014, a cameo role as himself on New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street, filmed while he was in the country for a one-off performance.[234] In May 2015, he appeared as himself and performed on a live episode of the NBC sitcom Undateable.[235] Later that year, while in Australia, he recorded scenes for the soap Home and Away, as a character based on himself.[236]\n After recording a cover version of Foy Vance's \"Make It Rain\" for Sons of Anarchy, Sheeran was cast by creator Kurt Sutter to play Sir Cormac in the medieval drama The Bastard Executioner on FX.[237] Sheeran also appeared as himself in the 2016 film Bridget Jones's Baby in a scene where Bridget Jones, played by Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, encounters the singer at the Glastonbury Festival.[238]\n In July 2017, Sheeran appeared in a scene on Game of Thrones opposite Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark.[239] David Benioff explained that since Williams was a big fan of the singer, they wanted to have Sheeran appear on the show to surprise Williams, and that they had tried to get him on for years.[240] It received a mix of positive and very negative reviews.[241][242]\n In June 2019, Sheeran made his debut appearance in an advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup.[243] A lifelong fan of the product \u2014 he has it with everything from fish and chips to his morning sausage \"butty\" to upmarket dinners, carries a bottle on tour, and has a Heinz Ketchup tattoo on his arm \u2014 he put forward an idea he had written for their next TV campaign, and the company responded.[243][244] A representative from Heinz started that \"1/3 of @HEINZ Instagram posts include people mentioning or tagging Ed, dating all the way back to 2014.\"[245] Poking fun at people who turn their nose up at those who ask for ketchup in fancy restaurants, the advert sees him walking into a \"super posh\" restaurant while narrating the message he had sent to the company. As the other wealthy diners look on in horror at the sight of a ketchup bottle, he flips the bottle, bangs it against his hand to budge the ketchup and smothers it all over his food. The company released a limited edition ketchup product known as Ed Sheeran X Heinz ketchup, also known as \"Heinz Edchup\".[243]\n Released in June 2019, Sheeran appeared as himself in a supporting role in the Richard Curtis/Danny Boyle film Yesterday, a film about a struggling singer-songwriter who wakes up to find that no one but he remembers the Beatles.[246]\n Music journalist Alexis Petridis has stated that Ed Sheeran \"brought pop back down to earth\" with his music style, introducing himself \"touting an even more austere version of Coldplay's dressed-down authenticity: one unassuming man, his guitar and a loop pedal\". Noting him as \"one of the most influential\" artists of his generation, as he spawned \"endless imitators\", Petridis remarked that the music charts were \"packed with Sheeran-alikes\" after \u00d7, describing it as \"the wave of earnest, dressed-down, boy-next-door troubadours\" that reached critical mass.[247] Similarly, The Guardian writer Laura Snapes cited him as \"the godfather of the current crop of singer-songwriters\" in 2019, stating that Sheeran inspired \"troubadours\" to enter the music charts, and marked \"the calcification of the everyman male pop star\", and the end of record labels marketing them \"exclusively to teenage girls and their mums.\"[248] Billboard writer Jason Lipshutz noticed that his appeal and performance style had influenced up-and-coming soloists, impacting \"a significant number of pop artists who crave his type of singular success.\"[249] The Financial Times considered that the scale of Sheeran's commercial accomplishments has \"broken through to such a wide and lucrative extent, far beyond the achievements of any of the other singer-songwriters in the market\" in the UK.[250]\n iHeartMedia senior executive Sharon Dastur declared that Sheeran's success has allowed newer artists to be given an opportunity in the mainstream scene with quieter material at the forefront, instead of dance music.[249] GQ's George Chesterton deemed Sheeran \"the de facto voice of a generation\" as a consequence of his music reflecting his personality and \"the defining characteristics of his audience\", with such recurring qualities of his discography corresponding \"with those that his own generation, the millennials, most value: authenticity, realness, earnestness, sincerity.\"[251] BBC Radio 1 executive George Ergatoudis has stated that his \"lyrical candour\" and his \"professional hunger\" resonated with younger listeners, giving him a \"very clear edge\" to breakthrough in a music industry that  is \"saturated with singer-songwriters\", while Sheeran's \"niche combination\" has made him able to perform at hip-hop, grime and underground events and \"convince the urban crowd that he was authentic\".[250] According to Vox, Sheeran has reached \"global pop culture ubiquity\".[252] In 2017, the BBC named him the second-best performing artist of the decade, after Adele,[253] while in 2021, The Independent said he had \"one of the biggest pop careers of this generation.\"[254] Billboard,[255] The Financial Express,[256] Brandon Sun,[257] and Arab News[258] have cited him as a \"British music icon\". Sheeran and his work have influenced various recording artists, including Shawn Mendes,[259] Louis Tomlinson,[260] Camila Cabello,[261] and Cody Simpson,[262] while English singer Hrvy has called him \"such a good songwriter\".[263]\n On 19 October 2015, Sheeran received an honorary degree from the University of Suffolk in Ipswich for his \"outstanding contribution to music\".[264] Sheeran commented: \"Suffolk is very much where I call home. Receiving this recognition is a real privilege.\"[264] He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for \"services to music and charity\".[265] Sheeran received the award from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace on 7 December 2017.[266] In 2012, he was named a baron of Sealand.[267]\n In addition to having the highest-grossing concert tour and being one of the world's best-selling music artists with more than 150 million records sold, Sheeran has received a number of awards. As of 2019, he has received four Grammy Awards (including Song of the Year in 2016 for \"Thinking Out Loud\"), five Brit Awards (including British Male Solo Artist in 2015), and six Billboard Music Awards (including Top Artist in 2018).[97][112][150] In 2015 and 2018, he received the Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.[98][268]\n Although he regards Suffolk as home having moved to the county as a young child, Sheeran was recognised by his county of birth in a 2018 poll when he was ranked the fourth greatest Yorkshireman ever behind Monty Python comedian Michael Palin, and actors Sean Bean and Patrick Stewart.[269]\n In early 2011, after securing recording and publishing deals, Sheeran purchased and renovated a farm near Framlingham, Suffolk, where he was raised. He has stated that he hopes to raise a family there.[75][270] During 2013, he lived between Hendersonville, Tennessee[271] and Los Angeles, California.[272] In 2014, he bought a house in South London.[75]\n Sheeran was in a relationship with Scottish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt (who was in his music video for \"Drunk\") in 2012, before breaking up.[273] Nesbitt is the subject of Sheeran's songs \"Nina\" and \"Photograph\", while most of Nesbitt's album, Peroxide, is about Sheeran.[273] In 2014, Sheeran was in a relationship with Athina Andrelos, who works for chef Jamie Oliver.[274] She is the inspiration of Sheeran's song \"Thinking Out Loud\".[275] They broke up in February 2015.[275] He is also close friends with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift; the pair collaborated on her albums Red (original and re-recorded versions) and Reputation, as well as on a remix of the song \"The Joker and the Queen\" from Sheeran's album =.[23][276]\n In July 2015, Sheeran began a relationship with childhood friend and former secondary school classmate Cherry Seaborn.[277] They announced their engagement in January 2018 and were married a year later.[278][279] She is the inspiration of the song \"Perfect\".[280] It was reported on 12 August 2020 that the couple were expecting their first child.[281][282] On 1 September, Sheeran announced on Instagram that Seaborn had given birth to a baby girl the previous week.[283] On 19 May 2022, it was announced that the couple's second child, a girl, was born.[284]\n Sheeran is a supporter of his local football club Ipswich Town,[285] and his +\u2013=\u00f7x Tour kit sponsored their 2021\u201322 season.[286] Additionally, Sheeran was named in the club's squad list and given the squad number of 17.[287] His +\u2013=\u00f7x Tour kit sponsorship deal with Ipswich Town was renewed for the 2022\u201323 season.[288] A collector of Panini's FIFA World Cup sticker album, he completed the 2014 World Cup album.[289] Appearing as a guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on 7 May 2017, Sheeran chose His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman as his book of choice, and a lifetime supply of ketchup as the one inanimate luxury item that he would take with him on a desert island.[290]\n In June 2015, Forbes listed his earnings at $57\u00a0million for the previous 12 months, and ranked him the 27th-highest-earning celebrity in the world.[291] In July 2018, Forbes named Sheeran 9th on their list of the highest paid celebrities.[292] According to The Sunday Times Rich List of 2019, Sheeran is worth \u00a3160 million ($207 million) as the 17th richest musician in the UK.[293] Sheeran's net worth is estimated at \u00a3200 million in 2020.[294]\n On 24 October 2021, Sheeran tested positive for COVID-19 less than a week before the release of his fifth album.[295]\n In 2017, Sheeran settled out of court over claims his song \"Photograph\" was a \"note-for-note\" copy of the chorus in the song \"Amazing\" by X Factor UK winner Matt Cardle.[296] Sheeran later regretted the decision to settle, saying that it was done on the advice of his lawyers who thought the case was \"more trouble than it was worth\".[297] He said he regretted settling the claim for \"Photograph\" not because of the money involved, but because it changed his relationship with the song. He said: \"I didn't play 'Photograph' for ages after that. I just stopped playing it. I felt weird about it, it kind of made me feel dirty.\" He also thought that settling the case opened a floodgate of claims, including the \"Shape of You\" lawsuit.[298]\n In 2018, legal action was brought against Sheeran, Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Atlantic Records by the estate and heirs of the late producer Ed Townsend, who co-wrote the song \"Let's Get It On\" with Marvin Gaye. US District Judge Louis Stanton rejected Sheeran's call in 2019 for dismissal of a legal case accusing him of copying parts of the song in \"Thinking Out Loud\". Stanton said that a jury should decide but that he found \"substantial similarities between several of the two works' musical elements\".[299] A previous case by Townsend's estate was dismissed without prejudice in February 2017.[300]\n Sheeran was taken to court in March 2022 for a copyright lawsuit over \"Shape of You\". Musicians Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue alleged that the song infringed \"particular lines and phrases\" of their 2015 composition \"Oh Why\".[301] Sheeran won the case, with Mr Justice Zacaroli ruling he \"neither deliberately nor subconsciously\" copied a phrase from Oh Why when writing Shape of You.[302][303]\n Sheeran publicly opposed Brexit (the United Kingdom leaving the European Union), and supported \"remain\". Following the June 2016 referendum result where the British public voted to leave, Sheeran was among a group of British musicians (which included Sting, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason and Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz) who signed a letter to then Prime Minister Theresa May, drafted by Bob Geldof in October 2018, calling for \"a 2nd vote\". Stating that Brexit will \"impact every aspect of the music industry. From touring to sales, to copyright legislation to royalty collation\", the letter adds: \"We dominate the market and our bands, singers, musicians, writers, producers and engineers work all over Europe and the world and in turn, Europe and the world come to us. Why? Because we are brilliant at it ... [Our music] reaches out, all inclusive, and embraces anyone and everyone. And that truly is what Britain is.\"[304]\n In 2017, Sheeran publicly endorsed the centre-left British Labour Party and described himself as a \"fan\" of its then-leader Jeremy Corbyn, while adding that \"I'm not Mr Political. I vote the way I feel I should, but won't tell somebody else what to do.\"[305]\n In 2021, Sheeran, along with several other celebrities, urged the United States Congress to pass the proposed Equality Act, which would expand the Civil Rights Act in order to outlaw discrimination against LGBT people. Sheeran stated in the open letter that the Act is \"essential to protect [...] the most marginalized communities.\"[306]\n In 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sheeran expressed support for Ukraine and participated in the Concert for Ukraine.[307]\n"], "https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-5-1600x-and-1500x": [" Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience.

The Ryzen 7 1800X was so good it became the first AMD CPU TrustedReviews has strongly recommended in the better part of ten years. But, the 1800X and the other two Ryzen 7 processors that launched a month or so ago are all high-end products with eight cores and price tags to match. That\u2019s where the Ryzen 5 chips come in. Launching today, the Ryzen 5 processors are available in six and quad-core configurations, and have a far lower upfront cost. This makes them ideal for more mainstream and enthusiast users who want a powerful processors but don\u2019t really need, or can\u2019t afford, the massive multi-core power of a Ryzen 7 CPU. There are four processors that make up the Ryzen 5 lineup, two of which are quad-core and two six-core. I\u2019ll be looking at the top tier versions of each, the quad-core 1500X and the six-core 1600X. Related: Best Graphics cards for all budgets The Ryzen 5 processors are the second set of chips to arrive from AMD\u2019s full Ryzen range. In the second half of the year we can expect to see Ryzen 3 chips. With the addition of these four new processors, the Ryzen range now extends from the \u00a3330-\u00a3500 of the Ryzen 7 chips, down to the \u00a3160-\u00a3250 of Ryzen 5. This pits them against Intel\u2019s Core i5-7600K at the top end and a variety of dual- and quad-core processors at the lower end. What\u2019s striking about the entire Ryzen range so far, including these new Ryzen 5 chips, is that they all have essentially identical features, apart from the number of cores and their clock speeds. All are multiplier unlocked for easy overclocking, all include simultaneous multithreading (SMT), all include Precision Boost and all fit in the same motherboards. Related: Best AMD Ryzen CPUs The only other differentiator is the X on the end of the model numbers which tells us whether the chip has extended frequency range (XFR). This allows the processor to boost the clock speed of one of its cores just a tiny bit further than non \u2018X\u2019 chips \u2013 up to 50MHz more, to be precise. This is all in contrast to the way Intel has compartmentalised its CPU range where different chips will or won\u2019t have Hyperthreading (Intel\u2019s equivalent of SMT), only a few processors are multiplier unlocked for easy overclocking, some don\u2019t include Turbo Boost (Intel\u2019s euivalent of Precision Boost) and you need to invest in completely different platforms if you want to move from a quad-core CPU to a six- or eight-core CPU.  Intel doesn\u2019t have any six-core processors at this price (regardless of platform) and the only quad-core chips it offers don\u2019t include Hyperthreading. This means the Ryzen 5 1600X should be a shoe-in for that middle ground between the eight-core Ryzens and cheaper quad-core processors. Related: The best CPUs for gaming It\u2019s priced to compete with the Intel Core i5-7600K and while Intel\u2019s chip has a clock speed advantage that will make it faster in single-thread applications, it\u2019s only quad-core without hyperthreading. This means the 1600X should have a handy advantage when it comes to multi-threaded workloads, such a rendering video footage. Meanwhile, the 1500X comes up against two Intel processors: the Intel Core i5-7400 and the Core i3-7350K. The former is quad-core but again it lacks hyperthreading and is actually clocked slower than the 1500X, so AMD\u2019s chip should compete on single-thread then run away with the victory in multi-thread. The i3-7350K is a different story. It\u2019s clocked at the same base clock speed as the i7-7700K and can be overclocked to 5GHz, giving it a massive clock speed advantage that will make it quicker in many day to day single-threaded applications and games. However, it\u2019s only dual-core (though with hyperthreading) and doesn\u2019t have Turbo Boost Technology so its single-thread advantage isn\u2019t as high as it could be and heavy multi-taskers and those that need multi-thread processing power will find it lacking. Competition aside, it is a little disappointing AMD couldn\u2019t squeeze a little more clock speed out of the 1500X. As the flagship quad-core part it would be nice to see it reaching the same speeds as the 1800X and 1600X, in the same way that the Intel Core i3-7350K matches the i7-7700K. That leaves the Ryzen 5 1600 and 1500, which we\u2019re not reviewing here. As non-X processors they generally have slower clock speeds and miss out on XFR. However, as they have SMT and are overclockable they still have the potential to be speed demons, and the \u00a330 saving for the 1600 could make it a particularly tempting option for those after as much mutli-core performance as possible for the least money. All the Ryzen 5 processors are built on the same foundation, which also powers the Ryzen 7 chips. The Zen micro-architecture was built from the ground up to address the power consumption and performance-per-clock issues of previous AMD processors. AMD employed a host of techniques to achieve this, which we won\u2019t cover in depth here \u2013 you can read more about Zen in our 1800X review \u2013 but we\u2019ll highlight a few of the key points. Related: Best gaming monitors\n\n The new design has boosted instructions per clock by 52%. A move that has brought AMD near enough to parity with Intel after years of trailing far behind. As a result, if the two companies released a processor each with an identical number of cores and clock speed they should produce near-identical performance. However, as it is right now Intel still has a maximum clock speed advantage so AMD is throwing cores at the problem. Another key addition with Ryzen is simultaneous multithreading. This is AMD\u2019s answer to Intel\u2019s Hyperthreading technology that allows each core of the processor to juggle two threads at a time, so it can deal more efficiently with its workload. This makes the processor appear to software like it has double the number of cores and results in a performance increase of between 10% and 30%.  The third key aspect to Zen is that power consumption has greatly improved. AMD\u2019s previous performance champ, the eight-core FX-8 9590, had a thermal design power (TDP) of 219W. The 1800X has a TDP of just 95W, while the Ryzen 5 range are all just 65W. Again, this essentially puts AMD\u2019s processors on a level with Intel. Another feature of Ryzen is Precision Boost. This is internal overclocking akin to Intel\u2019s Turbo Boost technology where you have a base clock frequency and then all the cores of the processor can overclock to a second higher frequency when needed, CPU temperature depending. Meanwhile XFR is a final little push that can be given to one core of the chip when it\u2019s under heavy load. The whole AMD Ryzen range can be installed in the new AMD AM4 socket, which is support by five AMD chipsets: X370, B350, A320, X300 and A300. All will support the range of Ryzen processors but only the X370, X300 and B350 will support overclocking; and only the X370 and X300 will support SLI/Crossfire. There are currently only X370 and B350 boards available and they range in price from \u00a380-100 for a B350 board to \u00a3150-\u00a3300 for X370 boards. You\u2019ll most likely have to buy a new CPU cooler to fit the AM4 socket, though unlike Ryzen 7, some of the Ryzen 5 range can be purchased with included coolers.

They ask questions about SATA vs SSD online. In this post, MiniTool Partition Wizard explains the differences between them. In forums, some people ask questions like SATA vs SSD, NVMe vs SSD, SATA vs NVMe, etc. To some extent, this indicates that they are confused about hard drive system, because SATA and SSD are not in the same category. In this part, I will introduce the whole hard drive system to you. 1. What is a hard drive? The hard drive we often say refers to the device that stores all the data of your computer, from the operating system files that govern your PC, the important work document that you absolutely can't lose, to the game also important to you. 2. How are hard drives classified? According to different standards, hard drives can be divided into different types. For example:  After reading the above contents, you can know that SATA refers the connector of the hard drive, while SSD lays emphasis on the storage media of the hard drive. Different Types of Hard Drives: Which One Should You Choose In this part, I will answer the following questions: What is SATA hard drive? What is SSD? In addition, when it comes to SSD vs SATA, what's the difference between them? And, what's the relationship between them? Apparently, SATA hard drive refers to hard drive equipped with SATA connector (bus). Then, what is SATA? Or, what does SATA mean? Usually, when a hard drive uses SATA connector, it means that this hard drive is using SATA bus. Then, what is bus? What does bus do? You may have new questions. To solve these problems, I will introduce how a hard drive works with the computer. When a hard drive is produced, people should consider how to connect it to the computer and how to transfer data between the hard drive and the computer. To solve those problems, people make bus standards. SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) bus is one of such standards. A bus usually defines the following items: In general, when you get the bus of a hard drive, you can get the speed range easily. Then, please keep reading to get to know SATA speed. Since the first SATA bus release, many advanced SATA bus versions has been released so far. Its main releases are displayed in the following list: Apparently, SATA 1.0 and SATA 2.0 have been obsolete, but SATA 2.0 socket may still exist in some old devices. At present, SATA 3.0 is the main stream of hard drive interface (because higher speed hard drive is very expensive still). As for SATA Express, its popularization process can be said to be quite a failure. As a result, the SATA Express protocol was replaced by the NVMe protocol, and the SATA Express physical port was also replaced by the follow-up M.2 and U.2. The motherboard and hard drive carrying the SATA Express interface is also quite few. This article explains deeply what SATA SSD and M.2 SSD are. It touches upon SATA Bus standard, PCI-E Bus standard, AHCI protocol, and NVMe protocol.  According to Wikipedia, a solid-state drive (SSD) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory, and functioning as secondary storage in the hierarchy of computer storage. Put it simply, an SSD is a hard drive using flash memory. Unlike SATA that is related to hard drive external structure (the connector), SSD is related hard drive internal structure. When we talk about SSD, we usually compare it with HDD. The two types of hard drives have different internal structure and therefore have many different characteristics. Click SSD vs HDD to know more. In general, a typical SSD is composed of the following parts: a connector/bus, an SSD controller, several flash memory chips, and an optional DRAM (serving as cache). The following picture shows a SATA SSD's structure and an M.2 SSD's structure.  The SSD controller is responsible for connecting the storage unit (flash memory) to the interface, so that the data can be transmitted to the computer; and responsible for the completion of various instructions within the SSD, such as data reading and writing, wear leveling (WL), bad block management, error checking and correcting (ECC), garbage collection (GC), etc. The DRAM is a chip standing next to the controller chip. It serves a buffer between the SSD controller and the NAND flash memory, making the SSD process data faster. SSD flash memory chips usually are NAND flash memory chips. NAND flash is a non-volatile storage technology, that is, data can still be saved after power failure. It has many advantages like low power consumption, low price, and good performance. To expand SSD capacity and lower the cost, manufacturers have made many efforts, for example, from plane NAND to 3D NAND, from SLC (single-level cell) to MLC (multi-level cell), TLC (triple-level cell), or even QLC (quad-level cell) NAND. As for the SSD connector, it could be SATA, M.2, U.2, SAS or other shapes, depending what bus it supports. Everything You Need to Know About Solid-state drive (SSD) SATA and SSD are not conflicted with each other. They can be in the same item: SATA SSD.  Nowadays, many people like to use SSDs. Among these SSDs, SATA SSDs are very popular. Here are some reasons: But SATA SSDs also have disadvantages. The biggest one is that SATA SSDs' speed limit is 6 Gbit/s. Comparing to other SSDs like M.2 PCIe 3.0 x 4 SSD(32 Gbit/s), it's slower. If PCIe SSDs or other higher-speed SSDs get popularized, SATA SSDs will be eliminated with no doubt. If you want to upgrade your hard drive from HDD to SSD or from an SSD to a faster SSD, you may need the guide on how to upgrade the hard drive. The direct way to upgrade a hard drive is to back up all important data to an external hard drive, disassemble the PC to replace the hard drive, and then install OS on the new hard drive. If you like this method, please refer to this post: How to Install Windows 10 on a New Hard Drive (with Pictures). But if your computer is dual-booted, or you just want to migrate the OS, or in other special situations, in a word, you don't want to use the above method, you can use the following method: Step 1: Connect the new hard drive to the computer USB port via a connector adapter. Step 2: Find a disk clone or OS migration program, for example, MiniTool Partition Wizard. MiniTool Partition Wizard is a powerful program. You can use it to manage your disk, migrate OS, clone disk, recover data, etc. Step 3: Install this software on your computer (you can click the following button to download MiniTool Partition Wizard Trial Edition). \nFree Download Step 4: Go to the main interface of the software. Then, click on Migrate OS to SSD/HDD in the action panel.  Step 5: Choose the right method to migrate the system disk and click Next. Option A allows you to clone the whole system disk, while option B only allows you to migrate the OS.  Step 6: Choose the new drive as the destination disk and then click Next.  Step 7: Review changes and click Next button. In this step, you can keep default settings. But if the old disk is a MBR disk and you want to use GPT style in the new disk, you can check the box before Use GUID partition table for the target disk.  Step 8: Read a note on how to boot from the destination disk and the click Finish button. Then, click the Apply button to execute pending operations.  Step 9: Disconnect the new drive from the USB port and then disassemble the computer to install the new hard drive. As for the hard drive installation guide, you can refer to this post: How to Install a Second Hard Drive in Your Laptop and Desktop PC. Step 10: If necessary, you should change boot order in BIOS. Then, you can boot the computer from the new drive. \nHere is a post talking about SSD vs SATA. SATA and SSD are two different things.

In this post from MiniTool, you will learn about SATA speed (including SATA 1, 2 and 3) and get some further information about SATA and SATA SSD. SATA refers to Serial AT Attachment. It is a computer bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs), optical drives (CD/DVD), and solid-state drives (SSDs), according to Wikipedia. Since its introduction in 2000, SATA has been widely used in modern technology and employed in various desktop and laptop computers. Nowadays, it has become the standard and predominant interface for our storage devices, replacing the earlier PATA (Parallel AT Attachment) interface. Why does SATA interface enjoy such a high popularity in our society? On the one hand, SATA requires less cable size and cost than PATA interface, with only seven conductors instead of 40 or 80. On the other hand, SATA is designed with a flexible port which enables users to connect to various device with ease. More importantly, it provides faster data transfer rate through higher signaling rates, which is a critical factor to consider for both users and manufacturers. How much do you know about SATA speed or SATA data transfer rate? Just keep reading to get further explanations. Related article: SATA vs. IDE: What Is the Difference? To meet various and changing user demands, SATA has been revised and updated for several times. Since 2003, it has experienced 3 major revisions and each revision has made a great breakthrough in the SATA data transfer rate. SATA 1, also known as SATA 1.5 Gbit/s, is the first generation of SATA interfaces and was released in 2003. Its actual uncoded transfer rate is 1.2 Gbit/s (150 MB/s), and it supports the communication rates of up to 1.5 Gbit/s. However, SATA 1 don\u2019t support Native Command Queuing (NCQ). SATA 2, also known as SATA 3 Gbit/s, is the second generation of SATA interfaces and was released in 2004. SATA 2 runs at the transfer rate of 3 Gbit/s, with a bandwidth throughput of 2.4 Gbit/s (300 MB/s) which doubles that of SATA 1. In addition, SATA 2 introduced Native Command Queuing and is backward compatible with SATA 1. SATA 3, also known as SATA 6 Gbit/s, is the most recent generation of SATA and the full version was released in 2009. SATA 3 communicates at the rate of up to 6 Gbit/s, and its bandwidth throughput is 4.8 Gbit/s (600MB/s) which doubles that of SATA 2. SATA 3 is backward compatible with both SATA 1 and SATA 2. Apart from these 3 major revisions of SATA, there are some other minor sub-revisions and we will give no more details. Of course, the SATA speed mentioned in this part is theoretical value, as the actual SATA data transfer rate might be slower due to various external factors. SATA 2 and SATA 3 are used more often than SATA 1, and some users are wondering the differences between these two SATA versions. Besides their data transfer rate, there are some other differences indeed. SATA 2 and SATA 3 are compatible with each other and both provide backward compatibility to function on SATA 1 interfaces. However, because of the speed limitations of the port, the maximum data transfer speed of the drive with SATA interface will be reduced. For example, if you have an SSD with SATA 3 disk interface and connect it to a corresponding SATA 3 port, you might get the maximum speed of 6 Gbit/s. You can also connect the SSD to SATA 2 port and it can be recognized, but the read-write speed rate of the SSD will be reduced to a lower level. Is there a noticeable difference in user experience between SATA 2 and SATA 3 for SSDs?  This is a popular question that has been discussed by plenty of users on the forum. Actually, there\u2019s no discernible difference between SSD SATA 2 and SATA 3 from a subjective user perspective. You might get great improvement in performance after upgrading HDD to SSD, but it not worth upgrading platform just to get SATA 3. As you can see in this post, the SATA 2 speed is already satisfying to meet common requirements of data transferring in our daily life. High data transfer data of SATA 3 might be attractive for you consumers, but you might not get a noticeable performance improvement. Of course, for those who require strong sequential performance, it might be better to use SSD SATA 3.

According to Sheeran's official Twitter account, the world-renowned musician will be releasing a new song called Celestial on September 29, 2022. There aren't any concrete details as to what the entire song will sound like or what its lyrics will consist of, but it will undoubtedly concern the Pokemon series in some way. Sheeran recently posted a preview clip on YouTube Shorts of him performing the song surrounded by his own Pokemon plushes. Fans will have to wait a few more days for the full song, but there's no doubt that the collaboration is generating plenty of excitement. Sheeran's official announcement has created plenty of excitement among his own fanbase and the Pokemon fanbase. The artist has previously been vocal about his interest in the games, and in 2011, he tweeted his appreciation for the Generation V titles: His appreciation of Water-type starters was also seen during his crossover Pokemon GO event in late 2021, which saw a huge upsurge of Water-type starters appearing in the wild in the lead-up to Sheeran's exclusive event performance. Almost immediately after the announcement of Celestial, Sheeran's fans sounded off on their anticipation for the upcoming song. This is certainly to be expected considering Sheeran's massive social media presence and his ascent as one of the most popular recording artists in recent years. His popularity has led to various collaborations, and it appears as though he's always had an appreciation for the game franchise as a whole. Unsurprisingly, there are more than a few Pokefans that enjoy Sheeran's music. One particular fan replied with a cross-post from Sheeran's official Instagram account, where the musician documented his journey with the Pocket Monsters franchise. According to Sheeran, he was drawn in by the Trading Card Game and anime before finally getting the opportunity to enjoy the Generation I Game Boy titles. He remarked that even at 31, he still plays the same Game Boy on long trips. Like many fans, Sheeran stated that the series has always been an escape for him, and it has also allowed him to connect with his childhood in recent years. Not to be left out of the excitement, The Pokemon Company's official UK Twitter account also chimed in on the collaboration: Although September 29 is still one week away, there's no doubt that the upcoming collaboration will delight plenty of Sheeran's fans around the world. The same can be said of fans of the Pokemon series, and the collaboration may even encourage new players to check out the beloved franchise.  Only time will tell, but the release of Celestial will undoubtedly be a major boost for both the game franchise and Sheeran's popularity in the music industry. Crossovers between the entertainment and gaming worlds aren't uncommon, but this one certainly has the star power to make an impact.

Serial ATA (SATA) and Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) are data storage protocol standards that have the primary function of transferring data (directly or otherwise) between the host system and mass storage devices (e.g., hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state disks). These serial storage protocols offer several advantages over older parallel storage protocol (ATA and SCSI) interfaces: Intel developed SATA and SAS solutions based on the latest FPGAs with transceivers. Stratix\u00ae V GX, Stratix\u00ae IV GX, Arria\u00ae V, Arria\u00ae\u00a0II GX,\u00a0Arria\u00ae II GZ, Cyclone\u00ae V, and\u00a0Cyclone\u00ae IV GX FPGAs support the electrical and signal requirements for SATA and SAS (see Table 1).

The FPGA provide the foundation, but the IP makes the SATA and SAS I/O possible. Several Intel FPGA Design Solutions Network (DSN) members developed SATA and SAS IP for both host and device interfaces. As shown in Figure 1, the IP cores have all the basic components of a SATA and SAS interface: a physical layer interface that connects to the embedded transceivers in the Intel FPGA devices, a link layer, and a transport layer.  Figure 1. IP Core The Intel FPGA SATA and SAS solutions are ideal for high-throughput storage applications. Using the IP cores, along with Intel FPGAs, provides a powerful foundation to build storage solutions that connect to host systems to storage. You can use the device and host cores independently (as seen in Figure 2) or together (used as a bridge).\n  Figure 2.

Scott Lowe breaks down the pros and cons of each.   If you\u2019re\ngetting into the storage game, even on a locally-attached basis, there are a\nnumber of options from which to pick when it comes to the way that you will\nconnect your storage. In this article, I\u2019ll go over Parallel ATA (Advanced\nTechnology Attachment) and SATA 1 (Serial ATA) and explain some of the\ndifferences between them, listing their pros and cons. Primarily, I will be\ngoing over the system interface types, rather than the actual disk types. This series will\nbe broken into three parts. For this article, I will present technologies based\non the ATA/SATA standard. The second part will go over the SATA II and SCSI\nstandards, while the last part will discuss fibre channel disks and provide a\nsummary and comparison chart of the various connections. Arriving on\nthe hard drive scene back in 1986, and originated by Imprimis (now owned by Seagate), Western Digital and Compaq, the ATA\nstandard has been improved upon a number of times and spawned newer\nvariations and enhancements, including ATA-2, Fast\nATA, Ultra ATA, Ultra DMA and many more. While some low-end servers and\nstorage devices do ship with ATA disks (not to be confused with Serial ATA,\ndiscussed next), ATA has some serious limitations. Parallel ATA\nis a parallel interface with each channel supporting a maximum of two devices\nand a cable length of 0.5 meters. While the two-device limit per channel in and\nof itself is not that serious, the parallel nature of the interface reduces its\nperformance since only one device at a time can communicate on the channel.\nFurther, current ATA/IDE drives do not support transfer speeds of above 80 MBps\nor so, a figure which is purely theoretical under perfect circumstances.\nMoreover, the overall design of parallel ATA inhibits real-world performance\ngains beyond 100 MBps, meaning that the standard would need to evolve before\nmaking this leap. The Parallel\nATA interface also suffers from some other problems. First, the sheer size of\nthe cable, containing either 40 or 80 wires, makes installing a number of\ndevices difficult. And, some parallel ATA cables are not keyed, meaning that\nthey can accidentally be inserted upside down. The parallel ATA interface also\nuses high 5V signaling, which runs counter to manufacturer\u2019s efforts to lower\noverall system voltage requirements for cooler systems. Lastly, while recent\nversions of the ATA standard do include CRC checks on the data, ATA command\ndata remains unchecked and is a potential source of errors, making it\nunsuitable for high-end storage needs. Both parallel\nATA and serial ATA suffer from operating system-induced capacity limitations.\nFor those running versions of Windows prior to Windows 2000 SP3, your operating\nsystem (and drivers) imposes a 28-bit logical block address (LBA), meaning that\nthe largest drive supported is 137 GB. Later versions of Windows support a\n48-bit LBA and, thus, can use drives up to 144 petabytes in size. Parallel ATA\ndrives are mostly relegated to non-server scenarios, including both laptops and\ndesktops, but even in these applications parallel ATA is giving way to the more\nefficient Serial ATA mechanism. Serial ATA 1.0 was\nreleased in August of 2001 (with subsequent revisions 1.0a and 1.1) and\nprovides significant improvements over parallel ATA. Most importantly, SATA\nprovides a serial bus for data transmission, with a single device on each\nchannel, thus eliminating device contention per channel. Second, SATA reduces\nthe connector pin count from forty to a mere seven. This has also resulted in a\nmuch smaller cable, which is much easier to route in a chassis. Even\nbetter, each individual SATA cable can be up to 1 meter in length, double that\nof parallel ATA. The SATA connector is also keyed so you can\u2019t connect it\nincorrectly. And, since SATA is a point-to-point solution, there are no more\nmaster/slave jumpers to mess around with. The SATA\nspecification is designed in such a way that it is software compatible with\nparallel ATA, so all operating systems that support parallel ATA should have no\nproblem supporting SATA disks\u2026as long as you have a SATA controller card and\ncables, of course. While many\nSATA implementations are point-to-point affairs, add-on SATA specs also allow\nfor a port multiplier that increases the number of devices supported on a\nsingle channel from one to fifteen, utilizing the full bandwidth of the main\nconnection to the host. However, fifteen disks would likely result in serious\nperformance issues since the host connections in SATA run at speeds of only 150\nMBps peak. An average disk provides about a 50-MBps transfer rate, meaning that\na SATA port peaks at three disks. While all SATA controllers are supposed to\nsupport port multipliers to some degree, note that not all SATA I controllers\nhave the features that enable port multipliers to be used in a\nperformance-enhancing fashion. On the\nvoltage front, SATA has a reduced signaling voltage requirement of 500mV, down\nfrom parallel ATA\u2019s 5V requirement. SATA also supports the ability to hot-plug\nnew devices, which was not possible with parallel ATA. Overall, SATA\nI satisfies many of the problems associated with parallel ATA, but even with a slight\nincrease in its theoretical speed (up to 150 MBps from parallel ATA\u2019s maximum\ntheoretical speed of 133 MBps), lower signaling voltage, and cables that about\na million times better, SATA I is still very much rooted in ATA-land and lacks\nmany of the advanced features required for high-end storage. SATA II,\nstarting to seriously hit the market now, improves on SATA I. The specification\ncalls for improvements that make it more enterprise-ready, including support\nfor higher speeds, native command queuing, and more. I will provide an overview\nof SATA II in my next article.

A judge ruled that the pop singer-songwriter must go to trial over accusations that his 2014 hit \"Thinking Out Loud\" stole from Marvin Gaye's 1973 single \"Let's Get It On.\"  Sheeran's lawyers had tried to have the case dismissed, arguing that the alleged similarities (in chord progression and harmonic rhythm) are not copyrightable, but the plaintiffs argue that the specific combination of those elements is legally protected. Judge Louis Stanton has now ruled this debate has to be settled by a jury trial.  \"The law does not support Sheeran's contention that the combination of LGO's chord progression and harmonic rhythm is insufficiently original to warrant it copyrightable,\" the judge wrote. \"There is no bright-line rule that the combination of two unprotectable elements is insufficiently numerous to constitute an original work.\"  Sheeran was first sued over the alleged connection between \"Thinking Out Loud\" and \"Let's Get It On\" in 2016 by the family of the late Ed Townsend, a co-writer of the 1973 song. That case is still pending. This is a different lawsuit, filed in 2018 by Structured Asset Sales, which owns a one-third stake in Townsend's copyrights.  This isn't Sheeran's first brush with copyright law. In 2017, he settled a lawsuit over the track \"Photograph,\" and earlier this year he won a plagiarism lawsuit in the United Kingdom over his hit song \"Shape of You.\" \"Whilst we're obviously happy with the result, I feel like claims like this are way too common now and we've become a culture where a claim is made with the idea that settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there is no base to the claim,\" Sheeran said in a video to fans after the \"Shape of You\" victory. \"It's really damaging to the songwriting industry.\" No trial date has been set.

I used the link you provided and from the device manager, the driver now shows a driver date of 5/26/2019 and version 2024.0.4.208. \u00a0 But now what about this Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller? What even is that? I looked it up online and from what I gather its something that requires use of an ethernet cord, is that right? I don't use an ethernet cord. At one point, I disabled that driver and my wi-fi was functioning just fine without it, so do I even need it? Anyways, the PCIe FE Family Controller might also be outdated. It's showing a driver date of 8/15/2013 and version 8.20.815.2013 is there a more updated version that I should have? \n\n\u200e01-02-2021\n02:14 PM\n\n You are correct. \u00a0 The\u00a0\u00a0Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller is the 10/100 MBPS ethernet (wired) controller. \u00a0 I recommend you use the latest driver directly from Realtek for that one. \u00a0 Download, unzip and run the setup application from the W10 driver file from the link below... \u00a0 Realtek PCIe FE / GBE / 2.5G / Gaming Ethernet Family Controller Software - REALTEK \n\n\u200e01-02-2021\n06:41 PM\n\n Thanks, I have both drivers updated now. The PCIe FE Family Controller now shows a driver date of 9/28/2020 and version 10.45.928.2020 I will now give it some time to ensure that the wi-fi functionality on my computer is stable and reliable. \n\n\u200e01-02-2021\n06:44 PM\n\n You're very welcome. \n\n\u200e01-02-2021\n09:54 PM\n\n So unfortunately the wi-fi just went out again on my PC. There must be something really wrong. Again I used the HP Network Check and it did the exact same thing as before. \u00a0 When I go into the device manager>network adapters>Realtek RTL8188EE 802.11 bgn Wi-Fi Adapter>properties>events>view all events then select administrative events under custom views, I have a huge list of warning and error messages (almost 14,000) they go back to 9/13/2020. Anytime the wi-fi goes out, I've been checking those events and there's always some warning and/or error message(s) coming up. I also notice on the events tab (on the properties window) it shows the same date with description \"device install requested\" followed by a bunch of other stuff. Could all of this mean anything? Should I attempt to do a system restore on my PC to a date before 9/13/2020? \u00a0 To give an idea of the things I've already tried, I have: Configured power settings on the drivers so that the computer does not turn them off to save power Reset the Wi-Fi router in my household Performed some kind of resets using commands on the command window Performed a hardware reset on my PC (shut down PC, remove battery, hold power button down for 15 sec & reset router) Did a scan using some diagnostic tool on the HP website here to see if it could be a hardware issue but it didn't detect any problems. \u00a0 Any other things I could try doing? \u00a0 \n\n\u200e01-02-2021\n10:44 PM\n - edited \n\u200e01-02-2021\n10:52 PM\n\n I was just trying to manually change network settings (step 3 on this page https://support.hp.com/in-en/document/c06282875) \u00a0 When I bring up TCP Global Parameters I get a pretty different list than what the sample solution shows. Also, there's no instruction on how to change these settings, should I change something and if so how? Here's a look at the settings I have: \u00a0 Receive-Side Scaling State: Enabled Receive Window Auto-Tuning Level: Disabled Add-On Congestion Control Provider: Default ECN Capability: Disabled RFC 1323 Timestamps: Disabled Initial RTO: 1000 Receive Segment Coalescing State: Enabled Non Sack Rtt Resiliency: Disabled Max SYN Retransmissions: 4 Fast Open: Enabled Fast Open Fallback: Enabled Hystart: Enabled Proportional Rate Reduction: Enabled Pacing Profile: Off \n\n\u200e01-03-2021\n06:27 AM\n\n Unfortunately I wouldn't be able to help you with those problems. \nDidn't find what you were looking for?\nAsk the community\n"], "https://www.stuvia.com/school/uk/thomas-mills-high-school": [" \nBecoming a Master Manager\nRobert E.

Farlingaye High School in Woodbridge and Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham were among hundreds in the country previously exempt from regular inspection. Between 2012 and 2020, schools rated outstanding were legally exempt from regular reviews unless major faults were found. However, the rule was lifted with Ofsted prioritising a visit to those that had gone the longest without inspection. There are 39 schools in Suffolk with an outstanding rating. Farlingaye was rated good by inspectors in March \u2013 its first inspection in nine years \u2013 while Thomas Mills received an inadequate score in a review last November. Another school, All Saints Church school in Laxfield, was given an ungraded inspection, and will receive a grade next time. The 2021 report found the Framlingham high school had serious weaknesses, primarily attributed to school leaders. A monitoring visit in September of this year noted that leaders made strides to improve the school, but it still remained inadequate. Inspector Richard Kueh said: \"The previous inspection report in November 2021 highlighted weaknesses in leaders\u2019 processes of recording, storing and using information to safeguard pupils from harm. \"Leaders of safeguarding have now introduced an online system for logging and acting on staff concerns about pupils\u2019 safety and they have also introduced a more-rigorous system for reviewing this information and checking how helpful the support that vulnerable pupils receive is.\" He also noted a range of channels had been introduced that allow pupils to communicate worries to staff, and students feel safe. The quality of education, behaviour and attitudes and sixth form provision were rated good in the inspection, while personal development required improvement. It hadn't been reviewed by the watchdog since it opened as an academy in 2012, with its last inspection dated to 2006, back when it was known as Thomas Mills High School. Farlingaye faired much better, with personal development and sixth form provision being rated outstanding, while quality of education, behaviour and attitudes and leadership being rated good. Lead inspector Adam Cooke noted it was a community where students feel safe and are happy, with the sixth form being described as 'one big happy family' with good links to higher education institutions. He added that pupils choose from a variety of subjects and learn much, but said leaders were not precisely aware of how well some areas of the school functioned. Regarding Saints Church of England School, lead inspector Steve Mellors said the school might not be rated as highly should a full inspection have been carried out. While it still retains its outstanding rating for now, the school \u2013 which was described as a place where students are eager to learn \u2013 will have to undergo a full inspection for the watchdog's next visit. Ofsted said 308 schools, or 80 per cent, of those reviewed since the exemption was lifted in 2020 lost their outstanding rating. While the majority were good, 17 per cent required improvement and four per cent were rated inadequate. It also found that 43 per cent had not had a graded inspection in over a decade. Ofsted's chief inspector Amanda Spielman said the exemption was introduced in the hopes the good standards, once obtained, would never drop, and freedom from regular inspection could drive schools to do better. But data showed removing scrutiny from schools does not make it better, she noted. Ms Speilman added: \"Regular inspection gives parents confidence in the quality of their child's school. \"Exempting outstanding schools deprived parents of up-to-date information and left schools without the constructive challenge that regular reviews provide.\" Guide to this year's racing season Directory covering the West Suffolk Area"], "https://www.amazon.in/HP-Pavilion-15-6-inch-5-3550H-15-ec0101AX/dp/B08CJ1513V": ["  Sacrifice nothing with the thin and powerful HP Pavilion Gaming 15 Laptop.

All Rights Reserved."], "https://www.thethings.com/taylor-swift-justin-bieber-relationship-scooter-braun/": [" Taylor Swift is not a fan of Justin Bieber due to allegations that he cheated on her best friend Selena Gomez and his friendship with Scooter Braun. Taylor Swift has been close friends with Selena Gomez for well over a decade, so it\u2019s not surprising to know that she doesn\u2019t get along with Gomez's ex Justin Bieber. Aside from claims that the Biebs cheated on Gomez in the past, the \"Love Story\" hit-maker has shared several feuds with Bieber, most recently concerning her master recordings. Related: 8 Best Looks Of Fashion Power Couple Justin And Hailey Bieber In the past, it\u2019s been said that Swift was always very much against the idea of a reconciliation between Gomez and Bieber because she felt that the latter was no good for her pal, who, despite being told to steer away from her ex, continuously decided to give their relationship another try. The Grammy Award-winning pop star certainly shares no close ties with Bieber anymore, but what really caused their feud to begin with? Updated on January 20, 2022: While there is no reason to believe that Taylor Swift has forgiven Justin Bieber, the drama and animosity between the two seems to have died down. Bieber's manager Scooter Braun no longer owns Swift's master recordings \u2013 he sold them to an investment fund \u2013 and Swift is in the process of re-recording all of her old music anyway. In December 2021, some Taylor Swift fans criticized Justin Bieber for liking a meme that poked fun at Swift, but neither star ever commented on this issue and there's no reason to think that Bieber liked the meme for spiteful or negative reasons. Updated on December 12th, 2022 by Abigail Thomas: Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber, despite drama in recent years, actually used to be quite close. They were friends before Bieber started dating Swift's friend Selena Gomez. The rift between the ex-friends started when Bieber and Gomez split, and Swift has implied that there was something going on behind the scenes. The bad blood continued when Bieber consistently sided with people feuding with Swift, specifically Kanye West and Scooter Braun. At one point, tabloids even reported Swift kicked Bieber out of a gym. Things are relatively calm now, but Bieber and Swift are certainly not friends. Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift have known each other for years. It can be argued that the \"Shake It Off\" singer could even be responsible for Bieber\u2019s success given that he was one of the opening acts on her Fearless Tour in 2009. Bieber was riding high from the success of his debut single, \"One Time\", at the time, but for Swift to agree to have the then-teenager join her on the road and perform in front of tens of thousands of fans each night was a generous move and certainly helped Bieber\u2019s career to propel much faster than one could\u2019ve imagined. By 2010, Bieber was dating Swift\u2019s pal Selena Gomez, and while things appeared to be going well between the couple at first, they were quickly plagued by cheating rumors well into the year of 2013. Dozens of women would surface claiming that they had shared a fling with the \"As Long As You Love Me\" chart-topper, and while Gomez never addressed the rumors, her actions spoke louder than words as she split with the Biebs several times. At the 2013 Billboard Music Awards, Swift was seen passing by Bieber and Gomez backstage, but her facial expression proved she was disgusted to see the couple together again, particularly since they had only broken up a few months prior. She went as far as to imply Bieber had cheated on Gomez in a 2019 open letter on Tumblr. It would be three years before there\u2019d be any sort of mention of Bieber and Swift again in the press, when the Canadian heartthrob posted a video of himself singing along to his frenemies\u2019 hit song \"Teardrops On My Guitar\". Swift liked the post, so clearly things were well between them at the time. Fans of the two singers hoped that the two of them had put the drama behind them. If Selena Gomez can move on, so can Taylor Swift. However, Bieber was not done throwing shade at the \"Anti-Hero\" singer. Related: Justin Bieber's 12 Biggest Scandals However, that all changed when Bieber showed his support for Kanye West in August 2016 when the rapper and his wife Kim Kardashian accused Swift of being a snake. Bieber seemed to be taunting Swift when he uploaded what appeared to be a screenshot of a FaceTime call between himself and West on Instagram. \u201cTaylor Swift what up,\u201d the caption read. The caption was deleted in 2019 when Swift began feuding with Scooter Braun. Bieber did apologize for the previous jab, saying on his Instagram, \"I would like to apologize for posting that hurtful Instagram post, at the time I thought it was funny but looking back it was distasteful and insensitive.\" The photo without the caption remains on his Instagram account. Swift didn\u2019t say anything in response, but when news broke that Big Machine Records was set to be acquired by Bieber\u2019s manager Scooter Braun, the former country star issued a statement about the deal, insisting that she was left out of bidding for her master recordings and that Braun was also attempting to sabotage her career. \"I learned about Scooter Braun\u2019s purchase of my masters as it was announced to the world. All I could think about was the incessant, manipulative bullying I\u2019ve received at his hands for years,\u201d Swift said in her statement. \u201cLike when Kim Kardashian orchestrated an illegally recorded snippet of a phone call to be leaked and then Scooter got his two clients together to bully me online about it [\u2026] Now Scooter has stripped me of my life\u2019s work, that I wasn\u2019t given an opportunity to buy. Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it.\u201d Related: The Best Songs From Taylor Swift's Midnights Album, According To Billboard Bieber, in the same post in which he apologized for the hurtful Instagram post, wrote a lengthy attack on Swift. \u201cScooter has had your back since the days you graciously let me open up for you! As the years have passed we haven\u2019t crossed paths and gotten to communicate our differences, hurts, or frustrations. So for you to take it to social media and get people to hate on Scooter isn\u2019t fair\u2026 Anyway, one thing I know is both Scooter and I love you. I feel like the only way to resolve conflict is through communication.\u201d Though Swift did not respond, there is still bad blood between them. In 2020, TMZ reported that Swift tried to have Bieber kicked out of a gym in Los Angeles. Swift had an appointment at the gym, and specifically trains when the gym is empty. Bieber happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and was asked to leave. Bieber and his team reportedly refused to leave, and he finished his workout. While all may be calm in the Swift-Bieber feud, the two are certainly nowhere near reconciling their past friendship.

According to the original suit, SAS alleges Sheeran\u2019s chord progression in \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d is too equivalent to \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On.\u201d A trial date has not yet been set but it will take place in Manhattan Federal Court. The Post has reached out to Sheeran\u2019s reps for comment. Sheeran\u2019s hit song received two Grammy wins for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 2016 Grammy Awards.

She has held various roles since joining the brand in 2019, and was previously a member of the human interest team. As a music writer, Rachel interviews everyone from rock-and-roll legends to up-and-coming stars for magazine feature stories and digital news stories. Rachel is based in New York City, and previously worked as an entertainment reporter at the New York Daily News after getting her start as an Entertainment Weekly intern. She has a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Maryland. \nTwo months after winning his plagiarism lawsuit over the hit song \"Shape of You,\" Ed Sheeran has been awarded more than $1 million in legal costs.\n \nSheeran and his two co-writers, Steve McCutcheon and Johnny McDaid, had been locked in legal battle for years with Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue, a pair of songwriters who claimed that the 2017 mega-hit ripped off their track \"Oh Why.\"\n \nBut on Tuesday, a judge shut down Chokri and O'Donoghue's push to have Sheeran and his team pay for their own legal costs, arguing that they didn't provide documents and \"demonstrated 'awkwardness and opacity,'\" according to the BBC.\n \n\"I consider it is appropriate that the claimants' success is reflected in an order that their costs are paid by the defendants, without reduction save for that which is made as part of the process of detailed assessment,\" said the judge, who reportedly awarded the trio an interim payment of \u00a3916,200, which equates to about $1.12 million.\n \nSheeran, 31, won his suit in April, with a judge ruling that he \"neither deliberately nor subconsciously copied\" \"Oh Why\" while writing \"Shape of You.\"\n \nThe victory came after an 11-day trial in March, during which the Grammy winner testified that he often shares credit with lesser-known artists, and added the team behind TLC's \"No Scrubs\" to the writing credits for \"Shape of You\" after its release.\n \nHe also reportedly sang \"Feeling Good\" by Nina Simone and \"No Diggity\" by Blackstreet to demonstrate that the melody he was accused of stealing is actually quite commonplace in pop music.\n \nSince winning the case, Sheeran \u2014 who announced last month that he welcomed his second daughter with wife Cherry Seaborn \u2014 has been outspoken over similar issues and lawsuits, which he believes are \"really damaging\" to the songwriting industry.\n \n\"I feel like claims like this are way too common now, and have become a culture where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there's no base for a claim,\" he said in a video statement shared to Instagram in April. \"It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music. Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify.\"\n \nHe continued: \"I don't want to take anything away from the pain and hurt suffered from both sides of this case, but I just want to say I'm not an entity, I'm not a corporation. I'm a human being, I'm a father, I'm a husband, I'm a son. Lawsuits are not a pleasant experience, and I hope that this ruling, it means that in the future, baseless claims like this can be avoided. This really does have to end.\"\n"], "https://edsheeran-2023.com/": [" Ed Sheeran Tour 2023  Ed Sheeran announces \u2018+ \u2013 = \u00f7 x Tour\u2019 Award-winning artist\u00a0Ed Sheeran\u00a0has announced a monumental North American tour in 2023 behind his latest album\u00a0\u2018=\u2019.

Intel Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, in Silicon Valley. It was invented by Robert Noyce. It is the developer of the first x86 processor -Intel 8086 If we talk on a scale of 1-10, Intel processors come at a scale of 4-10. These processors have good CPU performance and almost all Intel processors come with iGPU. This processor also clocks higher than AMD processors, at the cost of higher power consumption and battery life. Thus, for short workloads and single-core boosts especially in laptops, newer Intel-powered laptops can be used when battery life is not a concern. If we talk about Desktop, and you want to change processor, motherboard or socket\u2019s compatibility, then Intel has fewer options available for that in comparison to AMD processor due to frequent motherboard and chipset changes. Example \u2013 Intel Xeon, Intel Core i series, Intel Core m series 2. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) :\u00a0AMD stands for Advanced Micro Devices. It is an American multinational semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California. It was invented by Jerry Sanders, Jack Gifford, John Carey. It started supplying x86 processors as a second source manufacturer and became a competitor with Am386. On a scale of 1-10, AMD processors come at 5-10. It is cheaper than Intel Processors at a similar range. These processors are efficient compared to the current generation Core series. AMD APUs are also a good option for their good iGPU performance and comparable CPU performance to Core i series. Laptops powered with Ryzen processors often clock lower and less aggressively compared to Intel-powered laptops, they often run cooler and longer on battery, thus for laptops, when higher iGPU performance and longer battery life is preferred, Ryzen powered laptops can be used. Although, when building a new Desktop PC, older FX series CPUs \u00a0A-series APUs and should be avoided for their higher power consumption and heat output.If we talk about the desktop, mobile, and you only want to do normal gaming and for everyday use, then Ryzen APU is the way to go. For heavier tasks like video editing, 3D modelling, etc, Ryzen 7 or 9 CPUs or Threadripper should be preferred. For Ryzen Desktop CPUs and APUs in the AM4 platform, the motherboard chipset should be checked for support otherwise PC may not boot, although it can be easily solved with motherboards with USB BIOS flashing for newer processors.

In November 2022, \"Shivers\" became Sheeran's 11th song to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify. He celebrated via an Instagram post, saying that he was currently filming a music video for his next album which is set to be released in 2023. Sheeran was spotted at a beach in coastal Suffolk town Lowestoft. Ed Sheeran's musical style has been described as pop, folk-pop, and soft rock. Sheeran also incorporates rap into his music. Sheeran's earliest memories include listening to the records of Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and Elton John's Greatest Hits. According to Sheeran, the album that introduced him to music was Van Morrison's Irish Heartbeat. During his childhood his father took him to live concerts that would inspire his musical creations. These included seeing Eric Clapton at the Royal Albert Hall, Paul McCartney in Birmingham, and Bob Dylan. On the influence of Clapton, Sheeran states, \"He's the reason I started playing guitar\". He singled out Clapton's performance at the Party at the Palace in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, \"I was eleven when I saw Eric Clapton play at the Queen's Golden Jubilee concert in June 2002. I remember him walking on stage with this rainbow-coloured Stratocaster and playing the first riff of 'Layla'. I was hooked. Two days later I bought a black Stratocaster copy for \u00a330 that came with an amp. All I did for the next month was try to play that 'Layla' riff.\" In a complicated world, Sheeran\u2019s musical modus operandi is straightforward; to create well-crafted, expertly vague songs that unite people. His songs are vessels broad enough to soundtrack both a first dance and a funeral procession, a gut-punch break-up and a trawl around a harshly lit shopping centre. They\u2019re for life\u2019s big moments, with all the cinematic edge of a Richard Curtis film. He\u2019s also malleable \u2013 when he\u2019s done with hip-hop, for example, he doesn\u2019t need an image overhaul to then revert to balladry. If one genre isn\u2019t to your tastes, then fear not, another will be along soon. Sheeran has also cited The Beatles, Nizlopi and Eminem as his biggest musical influences. He is also a fan of heavier music and cites bands such as Cradle of Filth, Slipknot, Korn, Marilyn Manson and Bring Me the Horizon as other influences. As a teenager, he also had a Kerrang! subscription. According to Sheeran, he had a stutter in his speech when he was younger, and he credited rapping along to Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP for helping him stammer less. He was also inspired by \"Cannonball\" singer-songwriter Damien Rice in 2002, with Sheeran stating, \"seeing him play this small club in Ireland, I was able to meet him, and he was unbelievably cool. I went straight home and started writing songs. I would not be doing what I'm doing now if he'd been a jerk.\" He also played the guitar to Westlife's Greatest hits album when he was ten, citing them as one of his influences. Sheeran collaborated with his idol Eric Clapton in April 2016, with Sheeran stating to People magazine, \"I sang on Eric Clapton's album I Still Do. It's one thing having him on mine, but being on his, that's an honour that you can't ever pinpoint on how great that is. I did something for his record, and I was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso,' appearing as a guest on Clapton's \"I Will Be There\", in addition to performing the song with Clapton on stage, and he did something for my record performing a guitar solo on \"Dive\" on Sheeran's album \u00f7 and was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso.'\" Sheeran also cited Taylor Swift as one of his influences, suggesting in 2015 their respective success drives each other on. In March 2015, Sheeran announced he was setting up a record label, Gingerbread Man Records, which is a deal with Warner Music Group. The label was launched in August 2015 alongside its accompanying YouTube channel. Jamie Lawson, the label's first signee, met Sheeran while they were both in London's folk circuit. Lawson released his self-titled debut album on 9 October 2015, which has earned him a number one in the UK Albums Chart. Sheeran signed his second artist, Foy Vance, in November 2015. Maisie Peters also signed with the label in 2021. On 29 September 2019, Sheeran announced he was teaming up with his manager Stuart Camp to open a bar located on Portobello Road in Notting Hill. The bar is called \"Bertie Blossoms\", and named after his wife Cherry Seaborn. ..... \"It's good to show insight that these people are real people with real emotions and they deserve the same charity work as anyone else,\" Sheeran said. \"There's a lot more popular charities that get a lot of attention. And with certain subjects like this they're often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve.\" Tickets were available to those taking part in the charity's Give it up for One25 campaign by giving something up for 125 hours and hitting the \u00a340,000 fundraising mark. Sheeran frequently gives away his clothes to charity shops around Suffolk, his home county. An ambassador for East Anglia's Children's Hospice, he has donated clothes to the St Elizabeth Hospice charity shop in his home town Framlingham, including eight bags of clothes to the shop in February 2014. In 2016 he donated 13 bags of clothes to the shop. The tartan shirt worn by Sheeran when he met Renee Zellweger's character, Bridget, in Bridget Jones's Baby, was auctioned online to raise further funds for the hospice. On 15 November 2014, Sheeran joined the charity supergroup Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the West African Ebola virus epidemic. In November 2015, Sheeran supported the No Cold Homes campaign by the UK charity, Turn2us.

In the statement, Sheeran stated it will help artists aged under 18 with \"small but hopefully useful grants\". In May 2020, Sheeran donated \u00a3170,000 to his former school Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham, Suffolk. The donations, which have been made over a two-year period via the Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation, helped the school to purchase items such as MacBooks, cameras and a photography darkroom. The same month, Sheeran made a donation to Ipswich Hospital. In June 2020, Sheeran made a \"founding gift\" to launch Suffolk Community Foundation's \"Rebuilding Local Lives Appeal\" in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on the celebration day of the county, \"Suffolk Day\". Sheeran has donated over \u00a31 million to local charities in Suffolk amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including to a children's hospital ward. Sheeran's parents organised The Ed Sheeran Made in Suffolk Legacy Auction on 23 October 2020 which ran until 8 November. The auction had 220 lots, including items donated by other celebrities such as David Beckham, Kylie Minogue and Usain Bolt. Sheeran has donated some of his personal items including handwritten lyrics from his song \"Perfect\", lego bricks he played with as a kid, handmade You Need Me EP from 2009 and a \u00a33 ticket to his first gig at the British Legion in Framlingham. The auction was made to raise money for Suffolk charities such as GeeWizz and Zest who both support children and young adults in the county, including redeveloping a playground for kids with special educational needs and disabilities in Ipswich. In November Sheeran sold one of his paintings, marking the first and only time his art has been made available for sale, which he titled \"Dab 2 2020\", to the same auction. Later that month, Sheeran backed footballer Marcus Rashford's free school meals campaign and opened his own breakfast club at his Notting Hill restaurant, Bertie Blossoms. He announced on his Instagram that he provided hot breakfasts for \"anyone who is normally entitled to a free school meal or who is struggling in these strange times\". Sheeran's charity, the Framlingham Foundation Trust, is reported to have donated money to give a primary school teacher to take an imperative course to help children create songs with untraditional instruments which will benefit children with learning difficulties. Sheeran made his acting debut in 2014, a cameo role as himself on New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street, filmed while he was in the country for a one-off performance. In May 2015, he appeared as himself and performed on a live episode of the NBC sitcom Undateable. Later that year, while in Australia, he recorded scenes for the soap Home and Away, as a character based on himself. After recording a cover version of Foy Vance's \"Make It Rain\" for Sons of Anarchy, Sheeran was cast by creator Kurt Sutter to play Sir Cormac in the medieval drama The Bastard Executioner on FX. Sheeran also appeared as himself in the 2016 film Bridget Jones's Baby in a scene where Bridget Jones, played by Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, encounters the singer at the Glastonbury Festival. In July 2017, Sheeran appeared in a scene on Game of Thrones opposite Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark. David Benioff explained that since Williams was a big fan of the singer, they wanted to have Sheeran appear on the show to surprise Williams, and that they had tried to get him on for years. It received a mix of positive and very negative reviews. In June 2019, Sheeran made his debut appearance in an advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup. A lifelong fan of the product \u2014 he has it with everything from fish and chips to his morning sausage \"butty\" to upmarket dinners, carries a bottle on tour, and has a Heinz Ketchup tattoo on his arm \u2014 he put forward an idea he had written for their next TV campaign, and the company responded. A representative from Heinz started that \"1/3 of @HEINZ Instagram posts include people mentioning or tagging Ed, dating all the way back to 2014.\" Poking fun at people who turn their nose up at those who ask for ketchup in fancy restaurants, the advert sees him walking into a \"super posh\" restaurant while narrating the message he had sent to the company. As the other wealthy diners look on in horror at the sight of a ketchup bottle, he flips the bottle, bangs it against his hand to budge the ketchup and smothers it all over his food. The company released a limited edition ketchup product known as Ed Sheeran X Heinz ketchup, also known as \"Heinz Edchup\". Released in June 2019, Sheeran appeared as himself in a supporting role in the Richard Curtis/Danny Boyle film Yesterday, a film about a struggling singer-songwriter who wakes up to find that no one but he remembers the Beatles. Music journalist Alexis Petridis has stated that Ed Sheeran \"brought pop back down to earth\" with his music style, introducing himself \"touting an even more austere version of Coldplay's dressed-down authenticity: one unassuming man, his guitar and a loop pedal\". Noting him as \"one of the most influential\" artists of his generation, as he spawned \"endless imitators\", Petridis remarked that the music charts were \"packed with Sheeran-alikes\" after \u00d7, describing it as \"the wave of earnest, dressed-down, boy-next-door troubadours\" that reached critical mass. Similarly, The Guardian writer Laura Snapes cited him as \"the godfather of the current crop of singer-songwriters\" in 2019, stating that Sheeran inspired \"troubadours\" to enter the music charts, and marked \"the calcification of the everyman male pop star\", and the end of record labels marketing them \"exclusively to teenage girls and their mums.\" Billboard writer Jason Lipshutz noticed that his appeal and performance style had influenced up-and-coming soloists, impacting \"a significant number of pop artists who crave his type of singular success.\" The Financial Times considered that the scale of Sheeran's commercial accomplishments has \"broken through to such a wide and lucrative extent, far beyond the achievements of any of the other singer-songwriters in the market\" in the UK. iHeartMedia senior executive Sharon Dastur declared that Sheeran's success has allowed newer artists to be given an opportunity in the mainstream scene with quieter material at the forefront, instead of dance music. GQ's George Chesterton deemed Sheeran \"the de facto voice of a generation\" as a consequence of his music reflecting his personality and \"the defining characteristics of his audience\", with such recurring qualities of his discography corresponding \"with those that his own generation, the millennials, most value: authenticity, realness, earnestness, sincerity.\" BBC Radio 1 executive George Ergatoudis has stated that his \"lyrical candour\" and his \"professional hunger\" resonated with younger listeners, giving him a \"very clear edge\" to breakthrough in a music industry that is \"saturated with singer-songwriters\", while Sheeran's \"niche combination\" has made him able to perform at hip-hop, grime and underground events and \"convince the urban crowd that he was authentic\". According to Vox, Sheeran has reached \"global pop culture ubiquity\". In 2017, the BBC named him the second-best performing artist of the decade, after Adele, while in 2021, The Independent said he had \"one of the biggest pop careers of this generation.\" Billboard, The Financial Express, Brandon Sun, and Arab News have cited him as a \"British music icon\".

Stating that Brexit will \"impact every aspect of the music industry. From touring to sales, to copyright legislation to royalty collation\", the letter adds: \"We dominate the market and our bands, singers, musicians, writers, producers and engineers work all over Europe and the world and in turn, Europe and the world come to us. Why? Because we are brilliant at it ... [Our music] reaches out, all inclusive, and embraces anyone and everyone. And that truly is what Britain is.\" In 2017, Sheeran publicly endorsed the centre-left British Labour Party and described himself as a \"fan\" of its then-leader Jeremy Corbyn, while adding that \"I'm not Mr Political.

Specific Xeon market, I knew in 2010 on the ARM server project, ARM knew, AMD knew in 2010 that Intel was producing more Xeon than being reported. In fact, v2, v3, v4 were produced in parallel on customer 'specific generation' platform standardization and in incredible quantities in relation to the 20 M unit server per year disinformation. The entire industry has been chasing this installed base; v2/v3/v4 to replace it is the AMD, ARM, Intel and others emphasis. Also note the XSL/XCL market as a plum replacement target.

Rocket desktop dumping presents a carpet. Rocket was about 1) dumping, 2) Intel holding channel financially, 3) imposing an Intel cost drain on AMD subject Intel marginal revenue loss that was more severe to the industry than to Intel, 4) where Rocket imposes a deadweight industry cost, and 5) where only Rocket 11700 and 11600K clear in the prior month. Sets up an example of Intel two on one desktop categories vis-a-vis AMD that only worked against Intel and industry despite limiting AMD velocity of (a set) Vermeer supply pulling through on channel financial drain caused by Rocket Lake.

Question arises whether TSMC passes fabrication learning curve cost reductions along to the foundry customer? Intel front and back end show efficient and Alder Lake highly manufacturable.

Find my full report with complete data here in comment string;\u00a0 Intel CEO, chairman buy shares with stock sitting near 52-week low (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha  Decomposing industry analyst and PC tech media AMD and Intel q4 and full year market share; desktop, mobile, commercial, GPU and 2021 overall here reported by Camp Marketing.  Mercury published McCarron\u2019s AMD and Intel CPU market share for q4 and I will do same here for Camp Marketing Bruzzone on channel and production data with precision, decomposition what Mercury is referring, concluding with my PC tech media assessment which as usual is off the mark by a long shot.  Executive Summary -\u00a0  AMD desktop market share exceeds Mercury Research share statement 16.2% by just over double and for the prior three quarters.  While AMD Cezanne mobile volume gained over Renior and grew 100% in production volume q3 to q4, AMD mobile remains a niche in relation Intel mobile monopoly surplus overhang.  AMD commercial market current generation, again that's current generation Milan, has exceeded 15% share for the prior two quarters and is just shy of touching 20%, except, Intel will step on the volume production pedal at Sapphire Rapids.  Camp Marketing suggests Mercury Research AMD q4 share statement is designed to depress AMD stock share value ahead of Xilinx acquisition.  Desktop;  AMD Vermeer 5x v Intel Alder Lake only market share on channel data  AMD = 86.41% Intel = 13.58%  As everyone can see AMD current generation desktop share for q4 2021 is 536% more than Intel share so why doesn\u2019t tech media report on this share notation?  The reason, there is no counter point reporting in PC tech media only associate agreement of what data and whose data to present, how invented on partial or misleading or leaving out all the available data for independent assessment.\u00a0  It's about what fits and often times what does not on equity for inclusion on legitimate collaboration.  Where tech can create artificial boundaries on associate network whim that can and have proven destructive industrially, socially, holistically and in terms of corporate responsibilities and governance.\u00a0  Adding AMD TR 39x0 and Intel Rocket Lake to the above  AMD = 46.12% Intel = 53.87%  Adding Cezanne 5x only to AMD  AMD = 50.79% Intel = 49.20%  Adding AMD Matisse 3x + Renoir 4x and Intel XCLr EE + Comet Lake 10th includes XE22  AMD = 33.06% Intel = 66.93%  Adding AMD TR 29x0 and Intel XCL EE and Coffee Refresh 9th includes XE21  AMD = 28.82% Intel = 72.17%  Maintaining AMD and adding Intel Coffee Lake 8th  AMD = 24.24% Intel = 75.75%  Maintaining AMD and adding XSL EE and Kaby Lake 7th  AMD = 20.72% Intel = 79.27%  From a production stand where Rocket and Alder Lake appear to be 30 Mish unit half runs, the mirror reflection of ramp and run down volume, here on production volume AMD at 31,613,075 desktop all up V5C5 and Intel ALRL at 59 M units over the last two quarters [q3-4] on financial reconciliation.  Desktop production share  AMD = 34.88% Intel = 65.11%  Mercury q4 2021 desktop share for AMD is 16.2% and my data shows higher over several prior quarters. Camp Marketing assessment shows Mercury\u2019s AMD desktop share is presented artificially low. Here\u2019s close to McCarron\u2019s mix at 16.2% on the same channel data we both rely.  Mercury Research decomposition by Camp Marketing on channel data  AMD Vermeer 5x = 15.8% Intel Alder, Rocket and Comet S/W = 84.15%  Adding TR30x0 on Mercury Research decomposition  AMD = 16.7% Intel = 83.21%  What Mercury missed is that AMD Matisse 3x is a huge seller q4 and not scoring Ryzen 3x in q4 prejudices AMD desktop share in q4, is what the financial analyst community wants to hear? Or the PC tech media wants to report? Is it about affiliate sales preview commissions? That Matisse cleared and was a best desktop seller through second half of last year is missed in Mercury assessment and PC tech media reports? Where media missed out or collected and kept quite Ryzen 3x affiliate sales preview sales commissions through all of 2021?  However, AMD performance desktop q1 into q2 2022 is V5x run end finished goods. I suspect AMD desktop share will decline into midsummer. Rembrandt then picks up whatever desktop share AMD produces on primary fabrication into summer leads into Rafael Zen 4 risk production volume. In parallel Alder Lake ramps into midsummer then is mirrored in volume on Raptor Lake run down volume. AMD had as much as 50% desktop market share in 2021 and no source reported that fact. Why is that?  Moving to mobile -  AMD Cezanne 5x v Intel Tiger Lake H/B/U only  AMD = 12.53% Intel = 87.46%  Adding AMD Renoir 4x and Chrome book 3x only  AMD = 27.03% Intel = 72.96%  Adding Intel Ice U only  AMD = 21% Intel = 79%  Above appears to be the mix of mobile Mercury refers subject AMD mobile share 21.6%. My data traditionally scores v Mercury AMD lower on mobile.  Adding Intel Comet 10th U  AMD = 13.45% Intel = 86.54%  Adding Intel Coffee Refresh 9th H  AMD = 12.53% Intel = 87.46%  Adding Mac M1 and Max  AMD = 12.28% Intel = 85.7% Apple = 2%  Adding MS Pro X SQ_  AMD = 12.15% Intel = 84.79% Apple = 1.98% MS = 1.06%  On AMD mobile production share, Intel on CEO Gelsinger era supply signal cipher states 20 M Tiger mobile ship in q3 and another 30 M ship in q4 for 50 M total ship second half 2021. Analyst compares against Camp Marketing AMD at 10,080,416 second half mobile volume production on channel on financial reconciliation;  AMD = 16.78% Intel = 83.22%  Camp Marketing continues to score AMD current generation mobile and production share lower than Mercury Research 21.6% by less 42% channel share and less 22% production volume respectively. Analyst suspects Rembrandt APU represents AMD mainstay product holding APU niche stronghold into Zen 4 verse Intel Alder Core ramp into Raptor Lake run down.  Commercial;  AMD Milan v Intel Ice Lake only market share on channel  AMD = 28.44% Intel = 71.55%  From a production standpoint where Epyc Milan and Xeon Ice lake are run end entering Genoa in risk production since q3 and Sapphire Rapids in risk production because Intel never waits at xx% whole product on production volume here stated last two quarters on financial reconciliation.  Commercial production share  AMD = 17.09% Intel = 82.91%  Adding AMD Rome to Milan v Ice Lake only back to market share on channel  AMD = 80.13% Intel = 18.86%  But who reports on this statistically relevant data for AMD, Intel, stakeholders and stockholders?

I question McCarron\u2019s 491 M unit\u2019s calculated Intel + AMD $74 billion full year revenue / net $151.50.  Now let\u2019s consider media\u2019s assessment  Wccftech;  AMD managed to hit a record x86 CPU share of 25.6%, owing largely due to the growth in server and client segment, the desktop and laptop market share declined slightly as Intel gained.\u201d  Tom\u2019s Hardware;  \u201cAMD Sets All-Time CPU Market Share Record as Intel Gains in Desktop and Notebook PCs\u2019\u201d  Extremetech;  \u201cAMD Finishes 2021 with Record CPU Market Share\u201d  And this half truth \u201cMercury notes that AMD actually lost market share for desktop CPUs in 2021 due to the ongoing shortages caused by the pandemic.\u201d  Sure, however that volume was made up in Matisse surplus clearing inventoried ahead of the pandemic. AMD and Intel split desktop share periodically during the summer. May through Christmas AMD desktop is frequently around 36%.  What PC Tech media missed on mimicking repeater lacking counter point investigative journalism;  AMD record desktop share touches 50% in 2021 and in relation to Intel, AMD had its best production volume year in the history of the enterprise at 119,108,089 units.  AMD produced more notebook components in 2021 over 2020 but did not gain on Intel mobile, albeit Intel mobile is monopoly surplus heavy on Tiger/Ice/Comet quad U.  AMD Epyc Milan commercial share is higher than reported by industry associates on channel and production assessment.\u00a0  AMD losing its TSMC 7 nm cost for area advantage on TSMC markup has been supplying Genoa since q3 2021.  In relation to Intel, Core surplus overhang, deadweight, Intel continuing to clean up the channel no PC tech media will report on that, plus the overall volume slowdown in Xeon. I also don't expect Intel to remain slow while continuing to balance supply and demand for cost optimization on industrial management best practice for legitimate governance.  I expect Intel volume to ramp into 2022 and AMD desktop share to be knocked down a bit. Overall, AMD had a much better desktop and commercial production year then reported by associate analysts and media and its AMD's fault for not speaking up.  No wonder AMD can't find a Director of Corporate Communications on that open requisition the entire prior year.  Mike Bruzzone, Camp Marketing  ******  ORIGINAL POST OF February 10, 2022 Begins desktop and mobile break out. See Haswell and Skylake mobile return trend and 11th volume gain at slide #8. NOW with ARM mobile PC. On channel data on AMD 10 Q financial reconciliation, AMD production 2018 to date equals approximately 251,394,570 up to 275 M units taking into account 2017. AMD full line is sitting on to displace Intel Core line values in the channel, much of which is coming out of monopoly surplus overhang. AMD all up has a cap on top of Core.\u00a0Liquidation of channel inventory regardless of primary production, primary surplus or secondary values funds new procurements.\u00a0 AMD full product line including Epyc, Thread ripper, Ryzen and Radeon are relied to financially suppress Core. AMD wants to trade out those Core values it's all about exchange and who has what and how much to trade. Intel Xeon line values in the channel primarily Scalable I've estimated at 400 million units, and the reverberating surplus associated DCG v2/v3/v4 product laundering theft attempts to sit on AMD and ARM server value displacement. Ivy v2, Haswell v3 and Broadwell v4 values as they are exchanged can be cashed in for new procurements regardless of product category. Channel investment in new products can also be split between compute and networking. Competition is primarily about the exchange of back in time product values for new values whether AMD, Intel or other.\u00a0 Note Intel Tiger, Ice and Comet mobile are mostly quad U presenting a carpet designed to keep primarily ARM-based out of the market. Also when AMD by category production is broken out from its cumulating total shown as the AMD cap, will bifurcate to expose its competitive Intel wrangling's and vice versa. First detail slide up at #2, AMD is flowing and appears tied as caught up in Intel channel back in time sales bundle? Detail Slide #3 drills down further. Nvidia all GPU has been added since the original installment for comparing AMD and Intel total volumes. Nvidia rides to attach to all mass market CPUs seen in total Nvidia GPU volume. More soon.

Cameras showed Sheeran in the stands shortly after PSG had taken the lead as Neymar set up Idrissa Gueye inside the opening 10 minutes in France. PSG held onto their lead into the interval as City went close on multiple occasions as Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva hit the crossbar in quick succession as the visitors chased an equaliser. However, it was the attendance of the British singer that caught the attention of fans on social media. One fan wrote on Twitter: \u201cThanks for showing us Ed Sheeran was at the PSG game wouldn\u2019t have slept tonight without knowing if he was there.\u201d Another added: \u201cBeautiful assist and they suddenly showed Ed Sheeran\u2019s face, I almost jumped.\u201d The ball fell to Gueye inside the box after a fine passing move from PSG with Neymar's under-hit shot falling into the path of the former Everton and Aston Villa midfielder.

Why trust us? There are quite a few AMD-powered laptops to choose from as opposed to a few years ago. This is all thanks to the improvements in AMD's Zen architecture that have enabled the Ryzen mobile platform to not only compete with Intel when it comes to raw performance but also offer excellent power efficiency. Team Red has also started focusing on pairing its Ryzen processors with Radeon graphics, thereby allowing the chip maker to squeeze in a bit more performance through smart technologies like SmartShift and Smart Access Memory. Speaking of which, we've picked some of the best all-AMD laptops that you should consider buying in 2022. Additionally, you should also have a look at our recent list of the best all-AMD gaming PCs for 2022. Why you should buy this: It is the best gaming laptop powered by AMD's latest Ryzen 6000 CPUs and Radeon 6000 series of discrete graphics. Who's it for: For those who want the best gaming experience without compromising on portability and styling. Why we chose the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14: The latest iteration of the ROG Zephyrus G14 by ASUS cannot be ignored, especially if you are looking for an AMD-powered gaming laptop. In fact, the company has opted for an AMD CPU and GPU combo this year, which translates into excellent performance be it gaming or everyday workflow. Powered by the Ryzen 9 6900HS octa-core processor, one can opt for either the Radeon RX 6700S or the more powerful RX 6800S GPU. The display has been upgraded as well, which is now taller with a 16:10 ratio, 2560 x 1600p resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, 100% DCI-P3 rating, and up to 500 nits of brightness, making it great for gaming, creative tasks, and, of course, consuming media content. The laptop also gets some well-needed design updates including a more consistent color scheme on the white version, the addition of a webcam with Windows Hello face recognition, more suitable placement for the top firing speakers, a (much) larger touchpad, and RGB lighting underneath the keyboard. Expect no less when it comes to gaming as the ROG Zephyrus G14 can handle everything you throw at it with ease. The vapor chamber cooling system paired with liquid-metal thermal compound and some really good system tuning ensures that the laptop doesn't thermal throttle even under heavy loads. At the same time, it can deliver an exceptional battery life of about eight hours, which in itself is commendable considering it is a gaming laptop. Why you should buy this: A great entry-level laptop featuring an AMD CPU and GPU combo. Who's it for: For those who want an AMD-powered laptop for light workloads on a budget. Why we chose the Dell Inspiron 15 3000: This is one of the best AMD-powered laptops if you are looking for something that is not overly expensive. Available at a starting price of under $600, the Dell Inspiron 15 3525 is suitable for students, office goers, and as an everyday home PC. It can be configured with either the six-core Ryzen 5 5625U or the more powerful eight-core Ryzen 7 5825U, while the graphics are powered by AMD's Radeon series. Available with up to 16GB of DDR4 memory and 512GB M.2 PCIe NVMe solid-state drive (SSD), the laptop also has a provision for additional 2.5-inch SATA drives. The laptop features an all-black finish and a 15.6-inch display with narrow bezels, full-HD resolution, and a 120Hz refresh rate, and it's rated at 250 nits of brightness.

In terms of ports and connectivity, you get two USB Type-A ports (2.0 and 3.2 Gen 1), a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C port (data only), an SD card reader, a headset jack, a standard barrel-type power jack, Wi-Fi 6, and Bluetooth 5.2. There are also optional additions that you can choose from including a 1080p webcam instead of the standard 720p, a fingerprint scanner, and a larger 4-cell 54Whr battery instead of 41Whr. Why you should buy this: It is the best all-AMD ultraportable laptop for enterprise and business solutions. Who's it for: Those who want a durable and secure laptop tailored for office and enterprise environments. Why we chose the Lenovo ThinkPad X13: The ThinkPad continues to be a highly recommended choice for enterprise users around the globe. The new 3rd-generation Lenovo ThinkPad X13 brings all the best features that one expects from a ThinkPad. It is highly durable thanks to the MIL-SPEC rating that includes testing with 12 methods, 26 procedures, and 200 additional quality checks. Security is another crucial area where the ThinkPad X13 excels with its ThinkShield feature that includes a camera shutter, optional PrivacyGuard, power-on touch fingerprint reader, chip-level AMD Memory Guard, and the new Microsoft Pluton security layer that helps eliminate interface exposure and prevent physical attacks. The laptop is available with an all-AMD configuration that is available with up to an AMD Ryzen 7 6000 Pro processor with integrated Radeon 600M graphics. It supports up to 32GB of LPDDR5 memory running at 6400Mhz and up to a 2TB PCIe Gen4 4 SSD for speedy read and write speeds.

Who's it for: For those who want a great productivity laptop that can also handle some demanding games. Why we chose the Lenovo Legion 5 Gen 6: There are a number of gaming laptops on the market, but if you are looking for something that is available under for $1,500, the Legion 5 Premium is a great choice. Powered by AMD's Ryzen 5000 H-series of mobile CPUs, it is available with either the six-core Ryzen 5 5600H or a Stingray white variant that comes with the Ryzen 7 5800H. Both variants feature the Radeon RX 6600M 8GB GPU that is pretty much at par with the Nvidia RTX 3060 mobile, especially when gaming at 1080p. The base model of the laptop features a 15.6-inch display that comes with a full-HD (1920 x 1080) IPS panel, with a 120Hz refresh rate and 250 nits of brightness. There is also the option to update the display to a brighter 300-nit panel that is faster with a 165Hz refresh rate and support for additional tech like Dolby Vision, Free-Sync, and G-Sync for a better visual experience. Other notable features of the laptop include a four-zone RGB keyboard with 1.5mm key travel, built-in software for system tuning, a camera privacy shutter, and three months of free Xbox Game Pass. There is also a healthy set of I/O ports including a total of four USB Type-A ports, two USB Type-C ports, HDMI 2.1, a headphone/mic combo, and an RJ45 ethernet port. Why you should buy this: It is the best 2-in-1 convertible laptop on the market with an all-AMD configuration. Who's it for: Budding content creators, graphics designers, and those looking for a reliable everyday laptop. Why we chose the HP Envy x360 15: The HP Envy x360 is a sleek thin and light laptop featuring a 2-in-1 form factor. Primarily aimed at content creators, it should also serve as an excellent everyday productivity machine. The all-AMD version of the Envy x360 is powered by the six-core Ryzen 5 5625U, or you can go for the eight-core Ryzen 7 5825U. We personally recommend the latter as it also comes with a brighter and punchier-looking 15.6-inch FHD (1920x1080) OLED display that supports 100% DCI-P3, 400 nits SDR brightness, and 500-nits HDR brightness. The laptop also features some value-added features like support for HP's Digital Pen stylus, Quickdrop to transfer content between your mobile and laptop, and HP's Command Center that can help customize the PC performance along with fan speed and noise. There are also dedicated keys for switching off the webcam and muting the microphone for added privacy. Port selection includes two USB Type-C 10Gbps ports (Power Delivery, DisplayPort 1.4, and HP Sleep and Charge), two USB Type-A 10Gbps ports, HDMI 2.1, and a headphone/microphone combo. Other notable features include a MediaTek Wi-Fi 6E chipset with Bluetooth 5.2, an SD card reader, 65W fast-charging (50% in 30 minutes), and audio tuned by Bang and Olufsen.

As its name implies, SATA is based on serial signaling technology, where data is transferred as a sequence of individual bits. SATA refers to the communication protocol itself and the industry standards adhered to by the OEMs that produce SATA-compatible cables, connectors and drives. The Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO) oversees the development of the technical specification. SATA specifies a transfer format and a wiring arrangement. It succeeded Parallel ATA (PATA) as the communications interface for most new computer systems. Those systems also usually support serial-attached SCSI (SAS) and non-volatile memory express (NVMe) communication protocols. SATA is a serial version of the Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) specification for PATA hard drives that use parallel signaling. SATA cables are thinner, more flexible and less massive than the ribbon cables required for conventional PATA hard drives. Serial ATA HDDs and SSDs connect to a computer's motherboard via SATA controller hardware, which also manages data flow. When SATA is in IDE mode, the hard drive can be recognized as a PATA device. This setup improves compatibility with older hardware, but performance suffers. Setting a SATA controller to Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) offers better performance than the IDE mode. AHCI supports external interfaces and hot swapping of drives. The RAID mode supports both AHCI functions and RAID data protection features. Depending on the computer system, users may need to install device-specific driver software to enable SATA SSDs to communicate with the device's motherboard. IDE-based HDDs do not require driver software. The nonprofit SATA-IO industry consortium authors the technical specifications governing Serial ATA device interfaces. The consortium revises SATA standards to reflect increased data transfer rates. These revisions include the following changes: SATA-IO said it has no plans for SATA 4.0 interoperability. It would require significant engineering to support bandwidth higher than the current top end rate of 6 Gbps, the group said. When comparing SATA and PATA, a serial connection requires fewer wires and results in a clearer signal than a parallel connection. This makes serial signals suitable for transmitting data over long distances. A parallel signal is synchronous and requires a wider data bus. Multiple bits are sent simultaneously across different wires that are housed in the same cable. A clocking signal synchronizes the timing between the different channels. As a result, parallel transmission is better suited to shorter distances to avoid signal interference. The multiple wires that parallelism needs also makes it slightly more costly than serial transmission. SATA offers several advantages compared with the IDE-based PATA standard developed in the 1980s. These advantages include the following: Serial-attached SCSI or SAS and SATA are both technologies that use thin cables to serially transmit data from a computer's motherboard to and from storage. However, there are some key differences between the two technologies, including the following: Basic design. SATA connectors have four wires in one cable. SAS connectors also have four wires, but they separate the wires into two cables where each conductor pair can send and receive data. Because of this difference, SATA can only connect a motherboard to a storage device. SAS, on the other hand, can connect the motherboard to a storage drive and another device. Read and write speeds. SATA 3.0 writes data to storage at a theoretical limit up to 6 Gbps, but it reads data at a slower pace when pulling it out of storage for applications. SAS reads and writes data continuously at roughly the same rate of 6 Gbps. Where used. Because SATA reads data more slowly than it writes it and because it supports high capacities, SATA drives are widely used for file storage of data that is not frequently accessed. SAS drives are a good option for low-density storage workloads. Enterprises typically use SAS for large-scale storage, particularly to support direct-attached storage or hard drive controllers for enterprise server farms. Mean time between failure (MTBF). SAS HDDs have a higher MTBF rate that makes them more suitable than SATA drives for server-based storage. The MTBF of SAS SSDs ranges from 1.2 million to 1.6 million hours, while SATA HDDs carry an MTBF ranging from 700,000 to 1.2 million hours. Cost. SAS drives are typically more expensive than SATA drives. SATA was initially developed for electromechanical drives in which an actuator arm writes data to and reads data from sectors on a rotating spindled disk. The SATA standard was later modified to support nonmechanical SSDs based on flash storage. Flash is much faster than disk storage, but the slower SATA interface that was originally designed for HDDs continued to limit SSD speeds. The more recent NVMe flash interface enables a computer to read and write data to SSD storage at a faster rate than SATA and SAS SSDs. NVMe enables host software to communicate directly with storage subsystems. That eliminates the need for a bus interface to route data traffic back and forth. NVMe defines the host controller interface and storage protocol for flash devices optimized for PCIe, a serial expansion bus that enables computers to attach to peripheral devices. PCIe-based NVMe SSDs are available in a standard form factor and as dual-inline memory modules that are inserted in motherboard slots. Thin mSATA and M.2 SATA devices were developed to provide board-level flash storage. In 2009, SATA-IO unveiled the mSATA specification for small form-factor SSDs. The \"m\" originally stood for mini, but that designation is no longer relevant and the specification is referred to as mSATA. An mSATA device is a flash drive based on the SATA-IO specification. It is used in laptops and other portable computing devices. The mSATA spec maps SATA signals to an internally mounted PCIe card in a computer's motherboard, using an mSATA connector. MSATA drives are designed without an outer shell to fit inside small host devices. Their performance is roughly equivalent to traditional SATA SSDs. Depending on the manufacturer, some computer systems allow both mSATA and PCIe SSDs to be inserted in the memory slot. The pins and slots used by the two protocols are identical, but the standards are not natively compatible. System administrators must configure the drives to run either in mSATA or PCIe mode. The M.2 SSD form factor emerged as storage for ultrathin computing devices; it is generally considered to be an eventual replacement for mSATA. An mSATA device supports any iteration of SATA but is not compatible with the M.2 connector. Conversely, an M.2 SSD supports SATA, USB 3.0 and PCIe 3.0. When first conceived, SATA was intended as an internal mechanism to improve the performance of storage in consumer PCs. The need to extend that performance outside the chassis led to development of the External Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (eSATA). SATA-IO developed eSATA as a variation of the SATA specification, using the same pins and protocol to ensure consistent performance. This allowed SATA storage devices to be connected externally to the computer's motherboard. The process uses a rugged power connector and two meters of shielded cables to transfer data between external devices and internal storage. SATA-IO claims eSATA transfers data up to six times faster than the USB 2.0 or IEEE 1394 interface. A single eSATA port could be attached to an external SATA chassis to expand storage and build a RAID array. Video editing, audio production and data backup are some common use cases for eSATA drives. However, eSATA has limits. Many older SATA controllers and drives do not support the hot-swap capability that the external interface needs.

The pop megastar, who confirmed he'll release a record next year, performed eight new songs for just 600 fans inside London's Union Chapel in support of Will Young's charity Wellstock. Armed with nothing but an acoustic guitar, Ed sobbed twice as he spoke of his close friend Jamal Edwards, who died of a heart attack, aged just 31, earlier this year. The reflective, deeply personal tracks explored loss and grief, with Ed admitting that he didn't think he'd ever perform them live. The Shape of You singer, who demanded phones be locked away during the gig, apologised to the crowd for crying but said it was part of his grieving process. A source said: \"It was an incredibly special night. The atmosphere inside the venue was very emotional and there were lots of tears. \"To see someone as famous as Ed let his guard down in such an intimate gig really was a once in a lifetime moment.  \"The new tracks sounded amazing. It's obvious he has poured his heart and soul into them.\" Ed's last chart-topping album Equals was released last year. During the two hour set, Ed also played his biggest hits and told fans tales from his journey to superstardom. He remembered his humble beginnings as an aspiring musician living locally in Finsbury Park and dreaming of playing inside the Chapel, before upping sticks and moving to Nashville for a change pace via Guildford. The exclusive event, that saw 500,000 people apply for tickets, opened with Will Young talking about his own mental health battles and the loss of his twin brother Rupert to suicide in 2020. It was the launch of For One Night Only, the first in a year-long programme of events in support of Wellstock. Tickets for each exclusive money-can't-buy event can only be got through a charity prize draw.

Basically, SATA is the replacement for PATA, which adopted parallel communication (carrying multiple bits of data). Moreover, they have become a de facto standard for both HDDs and SSDs today. However, since its introduction, we have encountered several revisions, with the latest one being the SATA 3.5. Regarding the same, this article will guide you through the differences between these versions and whether or not to switch to the latest one. Table of Contents As the name suggests, the Serial Advanced Technology Attachment is based on serial communication. This means that data is transferred from the storage devices to the computer motherboard one bit at a time. This is why data transmission using SATA is less susceptible to any interruptions or damages. Moreover, the higher data transmission rate is another reason why most users prefer them over other storage device interfaces. In the earlier days, we heavily relied on Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment (PATA), also referred to as IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics). Reportedly, they use a 40-pins configuration with around 40 or 80 conductor ribbon cables. Apart from the bulky connector with vast sets of pins, their data transfer rate was also relatively low (up to 133 MB/s). Also, with the increasing RPM of the hard drives, PATA got out of favor and was eventually replaced by SATA. Basically, the newer technology was better in terms of data transfer rate (150 MB/s), and the data corruption rate was also significantly reduced. Moreover, the data connector pins were also reduced from 40 to just 7. Furthermore, SATA replaced the 4-pin Molex power connectors with much more powerful 15-pin SATA power connectors. The other improvements include the hot-swapping feature, less power consumption, and low-priced. Please look at the table below to learn the fundamental differences between PATA and SATA: Note: SATA and PATA are incompatible but can co-exist on the same machine having both the interfaces. Hence, if you wish to connect your PATA hard drive to a motherboard having only a SATA port, you require a PATA to SATA converter. Regardless of the SATA bus interface type, the working mechanism remains the same. Well, it has a five-layered architecture \u2013 physical, link, transport, command, and application layers. Well, PATA was extensively used for almost two decades. However, even after SATA replaced them, the data transfer rate wasn\u2019t still high to work best with storage devices having higher RPMs. Hence, it was evident that users were looking to replace the first version of SATA as soon as possible. Thus, the SATA interface was revised multiple times to fit consumer needs. Unfortunately, the Serial ATA Working Group isn\u2019t working on a next revision further than 3.5. Hence, it\u2019s very likely that this legacy protocol standard will be replaced by newer technology, possibly NVMe. To learn more about it, read our other article on the differences between SATA and NVMe. SATA, SATA 1, or SATA-I was introduced in 2003. Well, the first-ever revision, \u20181.0a,\u2019 was worked just to replace the Parallel ATA technology. Moving on, they had an improved data transfer speed than PATA but were eventually replaced by the second revision, which was comparatively much faster. Also, as mentioned earlier, they introduced advanced power and data connectors that made connecting the storage devices to the circuit board easier. Furthermore, SATA 1.0 had weaker motherboard ports and was easily breakable. In fact, most users were frustrated with the frequent loose connections and shaking issues when connecting to the sockets. Since SATA 1 was still slower and didn\u2019t match the highest speed of some HDDs, a significant revision was done in 2004. This was named SATA 2 or SATA-II, and it has a better data transfer rate, bandwidth throughput, and additionally introduced NCQ implementation, which was missing in 1.0. Further, this generation was revised twice (2.5 in 2005 and 2.6 in 2007) for further improvements on connectors, NCQ priority, NCQ unload, etc. In 2009, the Serial ATA International Organization introduced SATA 3, which replaced SATA 2. Thus, most modern motherboards come with SATA 3 ports. Nonetheless, some older ones still have SATA 2 headers. As expected, the third generation came with a much higher data transfer rate. Among the various changes, the most noticeable is the lock mechanism that ensures the connectors do not come off quickly. Furthermore, SATA 3 or SATA-III was revised five times, with each update adding new features \u2013 3.1 (2011), 3.2 (2013), 3.3 (2016), 3.4 (2018), and 3.5 (2020). Basically, each revision added increased performance and better integration of the secondary storage devices. Now that you know about the three generations of SATA, it\u2019s time to dive deep into the major differences between them. Generally, SATA, SATA 2, and SATA 3 differ in header labels, data transfer rate, NCQ implementation, lock mechanism, data connectors, and power connectors. In this section, you\u2019ll learn each of these factors in brief. The data transfer rate determines the speed of the SATA interface. Basically, it can be defined as the amount of data moving from the HDDs or SSDs to the host computer. Well, the data transfer rate is the most crucial difference between the three generations of SATA. Indeed, this factor helps us determine the fastest SATA version. Reportedly, the first generation SATA (SATA-I) replaced PATA and has an uncoded data transfer rate of 150 MB/s (1.5 Gb/s). This is possible by the 8b/10b encoding, where an eight-bit word is converted to a 10-bit symbol. Next, the second generation SATA, aka SATA-II or SATA 2, has a native data transfer rate precisely double of the first generation, i.e., 300 MB/s (3.0 Gb/s), also accounting for the 8b/10b encoding. Lastly, SATA 3 also uses the 8b/10b encoding scheme and has a native data transfer rate of 600 MB/s (6.0 Gb/s). Hence, it\u2019s pretty clear that the third generation is much faster than the other two revisions. Moving on to its appearance, the SATA cables and connectors look precisely the same. Nonetheless, motherboard manufacturers produce different colored cables (red, blue, yellow, black, orange) to distinguish the different SATA generations. However, there is a visible difference in the cable connectors. While SATA 1 and 2 look pretty identical, the addition of a lock mechanism in SATA 3 makes them unique from the former two. Whether SATA 1, 2, or 3, you can connect all of them to the same motherboard header. Thus, the only way to identify the ports is by checking the port label. For SATA 2, you can find indications like SATA 2_2, SATA2_5, SATA2_3, etc. Similarly, for SATA 3, you can find indications like SATA 3_3, SATA 3, SATA 3_5, etc. However, if you have a computer from the early 2000s, you\u2019ll likely find the labels imprinted just SATA, meaning they belong to the first generation. Native Command Queuing (NCQ) is one of the SATA features that ensures read/write head movements are significantly reduced so that they are executed in the best order possible. In SATA 1, this feature wasn\u2019t available, meaning there were unnecessary head movements. This resulted in poor performance, and the HDDs or SSDs used to wear off easily (although still better than PATA). However, SATA 2 and 3 both utilize this protocol that allows the storage drives to self-determine the effective order. This significantly reduced the number of head rotations, and the same work was done much quicker than that of SATA 1 with no NCQ implementation. Let\u2019s look at the above illustration to understand this more quickly. In SATA 1, the drive head rotates three times to perform a task, taking a longer path. On the other hand, in NCQ implemented SATA 2 and 3, the drive head rotates just two times, taking a shorter route for the completion of the same task. Although the SATA 1, 2, and 3 data connectors look all identical, the features definitely distinguish them from one another.\u00a0 Well, there\u2019s no noticeable difference between SATA 1 and 2. However, the SATA 3.0 revision started using two foil-shielded differential pairs that provided a significant advantage in the transmission line. Basically, this allows ease of routing cables and surprisingly reduces the cost too. Unlike the data connectors, the Serial ATA Working Group, made quite a lot of changes in the power connectors. Well, the first revision was adopted in the 2.6 version that produced a slimline connector to be used by notebook optical drives and other smaller factors. Moreover, the 2.6 revision also introduced the micro SATA and a separate microdata connector, which is significantly thinner. However, this was only intended for 1.8-inch hard disk drives. Furthermore, revision 3.3 adopted PWDIS in its third pin allowing it to enter and exit the POWER DISABLE mode. This also made it compatible with SAS specifications. Lastly, the earlier versions of SATA 1 also came with the Molex connectors to be compatible with the PATA cables. However, this was removed from the latter versions of SATA 1 and is no longer found. Well, you can go through our other post that guides you on how to connect the SATA power cable.\u00a0 Well, the major problem with the SATA 1 data connectors was that they were easily plugged out due to a missing locking mechanism. Although SATA 2 improved the connectors, they still lacked locks that made the connection secure. However, SATA 3 introduced special metal lock clips that ensure the cables do not plug out easily. Moreover, there are right- or left-angled connectors that also prevent accidental loosing of the cables. As shown in the above figure, revision 2.0 didn\u2019t come with the lock mechanism. On the other hand, there\u2019s a small metal spring on SATA 3.0 that ensures the jack is securely attached to the motherboard and storage devices\u2019 ports.\u00a0 As mentioned earlier, SATA 1, 2, and 3 have a similar working mechanism and adopt the same architecture. Moreover, the data and power connectors\u2019 pin configurations also remain the same. Firstly, the data connectors are 8 mm wide and have a total of seven pins \u2013 three grounds and four data lines (A+, A-, B+, B-). On the other hand, power connectors are relatively wider and have a 15-pin configuration \u2013 nine power lines, five grounds, and one for staggering activity. Interestingly, newer motherboards provide two to four of these SATA cables in their box. However, the pins of the slimline and micro power connectors are significantly reduced. Nonetheless, the working mechanism remains identical. Moving on, all the SATA generations have an optional hotplugging interface. However, to enable it, you require a supporting host device and OS.\u00a0 Lastly, all the SATA revisions are forward and backward-compatible. This means that you can use SATA 1 cable on SATA 2 and 3 ports, or SATA 2 cable on SATA 1 and 3 ports, and SATA 3 on 1 and 2 ports. Caution: Despite the legacy support, the maximum speed capacity gets reduced due to the differences between the port and cable generation. For example, if you\u2019re using a SATA 3 connector on SATA 2 ports, the storage device will be limited to the features of SATA 2. Since SATA 1 or 2 can efficiently perform read and write functions on SATA 3 ports, you can still use them instead of switching to SATA 3. Nonetheless, you\u2019ll be limited to plenty of features available in the third generation.\u00a0 Likewise, you\u2019ll also miss out on the lock mechanism on SATA 3 connectors if you still prefer using SATA 1 and 2 cables.\u00a0 Moreover, using SATA 2 or 3 on HDDs is completely fine, as both support the maximum speed supported by most hard drives. However, SSDs usually have a rate of 500 MB/s, and to take complete advantage, we recommend using SATA 3. Hence, if your motherboard only supports SATA 2, but you\u2019re looking to add SATA 3 ports, you can easily do so using extension cards.\u00a0 Thus, if you\u2019re planning to upgrade to SATA 3, you can have a look at the final comparison chart below and decide for yourself.

As the price of flash storage has come down over the years we thought it would be worth wondering out loud if there was a better alternative to the old RAID 1 setup. I want to predicate this article by stating no matter what hard drive configuration you ever choose you should always always always maintain an off-site backup of your data. I will also state that we have deployed over 10,000 custom configured servers over the last 10 years and although we offer numerous RAID configurations, many people do not add them and although we offer automated backup solutions, many people do not pay for that either and although we always recommend our customers keep their own backup, many people do not. Lastly, I will point out that we offer fully managed servers and self-managed servers. It is our experience that those self-managed customers do not always use the tools available to them to check on the health of their RAID arrays allowing them to get ahead of failures. So this article is meant to discuss what the best bare minimum acceptable server configuration is with today\u2019s technology.  For years two spinning disks in a RAID 1 mirror configuration has been the go to setup for people wanting a bit of comfort from data loss without breaking the bank. With the advent of the much more reliable SSD (Solid State Drives) should this still be our go to better-than-nothing hard drive configuration? Since SSDs are considerably more reliable than spinning disks would simply having an SSD as the primary drive with a 2nd SATA3 drive setup for local backups be a more reliable, better performing, low cost solution?  To answer the question we must first understand the benefits and details of each option.  Due to falling costs, excellent reliability, and super-fast reading speeds, SSDs are an increasingly popular storage option for servers. What we are proposing as an alternative to RAID is to have an SSD as your primary coupled with a SATA3 drive mounted for backups. Then it is just a matter of a running a simple cron job each night to backup your data to that SATA disk. While SSDs are more expensive than SATA, their price continues to drop narrowing that price gap. Additionally, this configuration drops the expense of having a RAID card pretty much bringing the drive costs to parity and resulting in the server costing about the same per month at the end of the day.  SSDs offer significant performance improvements over RAID1. SSDs average transfer speeds of up to 550MB/s, while HDD offer average transfer speeds of up to 180MB/s. The MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) of an SSD drive is 2 million hours, while spindle hard drive\u2019s MTBF is ~1.5 million hours. RAID 1 (or mirroring) is a simple solution for reducing the risk of data loss. While RAID is not a backup solution, it is an insurance policy that if 1 drive fails you have better odds of retrieving your data from the remaining operational hard drive. In a perfect world, when a drive fails in a RAID 1 array you simply swap out the failed drive with a new one, rebuild the array and all is well in the world again. This doesn\u2019t always work, however, and sometimes the data on both drives gets corrupted, and you end up losing your data. Two spindle hard drives in a RAID 1 array will be slightly faster than a single spindle hard drive, but nowhere near the performance of today\u2019s SSDs. Spindle hard drives have a much higher failure rate, Spindle hard drives experience an annual failure rate of ~5%, while SSD enjoy a much lower annual failure rate of ~1.5%. Another issue with RAID is if an add-in RAID controller card is used. This introduces another point of failure. While most RAID cards will last a lifetime, approximately ~3% fail per year. In the event of a RAID card failure, you run the risk of your data being corrupted or entirely lost. Using on-board RAID is risky as well, if the mainboard fails, you risk losing the array, and your data. Either one will likely end up causing you a lot of downtime and misery. \n SSDs offer undoubtedly superior dedicated performance over RAID 1 using SATA or SAS spinning disks. So the performance question is really no contest.  Now let\u2019s revisit the reliability numbers quickly; It seems the question of reliability is also undisputed. When SSDs are backed up nightly to SATA your data is safer than if you use utilize two spindle drives in RAID1. A few things to note, SATA and SAS often begin to fail gradually with a decline in performance, while SSDs could be prone to sudden failures without prior warning in certain environments. So while an SSD dies a sudden death with no warning, you at least have that backup drive to restore from. While spinning disks often die a slow death with warning signs that the end is near, during that gradual death cycle the symptoms of the failing drive(s) might very well lead to data corruption on both drives. Under this scenario you are restoring from a backup (hopefully) anyway. Additionally, if one of your drives in a RAID array is failing it raises the likelihood the other drive will also fail soon. SSDs can survive extreme temperatures as well as increased wear and tear due to a lack of moving parts. Spinning disks can become damanaged from the slight vibrations or jostling during hands-on maintenance. Our conclusion is when used in a secure environment, SSDs are more likely to enjoy increased reliability over SATA RAID 1. This is reflected in their mean time between failures of over two millions hours. When used in conjunction with a SATA backup, the risk of data loss is significantly less than when using RAID 1 alone. I\u2019ve been wondering about the comparison of RAID card failure vs newer SSD failure. For years, I\u2019ve used RAID 1 on a pair of HDDs, but now it seems that the RAID card itself introduces a failure rate in excess of SSDs. Singer SSD is better 2 HDD RAID 1 We recently had 2 backup servers that comprised our backup solution. They were put online within a day of each other and both had SSDs in a RAID 1. One drive failed on one then 8 hours later the other drive failed before I could replace the first drive. We completely lost that location. Oh well atleast we have one location working. Three days later the first drive failed at that location and just a couple hours later the other drive failed. We were hard down for two months with no way to backup or restore. Luckily the data volumes were mechanical HDDs so we did eventually get the data back. Ive known other people who have had this happen. SSDs have an exact number of writes. Putting them in a RAID 1 makes no sense because they do not have the bell curve failure rate mechanical disks do. If you have done this not thinking (like I did), go ahead and pull out your redundant RAID disk and replace it with a new one to stagger the failures and save your sanity. You can argue theory all day or so that you are a very lucky person or whatever but this is real life. SSDs do not have the same characteristics as the old spindle disks so we need to stop using old safeguards for new technologies. SSD also need to be overprovisioned by a certain percent, to increase their lifetime.\nBasically only format it to 80% capacity and it will last 20% longer. Even better, 60%. SSD\u2019s are \u200breally only useful, imho, in the RAID world as a caching drive, rather than as a primary. They will die quicker. I\u2019m retired now but used to provide servers to my customers. Servers were always either RAID1 for smaller customers or up to eight drive RAID 10 arrays. Sometimes software RAID 1 (ecch! because of budgets). Always had backup drives and overnight backup copies to an internal backup drive plus multiple daily backups to be taken offsite. We never lost data. After retiring, my own server, consisting of two three drive RAID 5 arrays (primary and backup) started to get corrupted data on both sets of drives. I suspected the RAID controller. I got through to the MegaRAID (PERC, etc.) engineers and from the symptoms they said the memory in the controller was bad. I asked how to run a memory test. Turns out there was no memory test! Worse, they did not even use ECC Memory!!! I replaced the primary drives with an enterprise class Micron SDD and just a fast Barracuda Pro backup drive. The machine was way faster of course and backups took a little longer but they were overnight, so it wasn\u2019t critical. I recently (last year) upgraded my server to a 4TB Micron 7300 PRO. It has internal RAIN (similar to RAID) with a heck of a lot of overprovisioning already. It doesn\u2019t really make sense to put in a pair of highly reliable SSDs that have to run under crappy controllers. It\u2019s one thing for your drive to die all of a sudden. Its absolutely much worse for a RAID controller to slowly destroy little bits of files for days or weeks before anyone realizes it, then try to find all the backups for them, and rebuild them one by one. I was lucky I had multiple backups from days, weeks, and months before to restore from. So I\u2019m glad to see these failure rates put into perspective. It confirms I made the best choice for me. I still keep multiple backup copies though. Those that have to use RAID to ensure/hope data entered during the day is not lost, now have a difficult choice. Thanks,\nBob.

It was released through Def Jam Recordings, Interscope Records, and Friends Keep Secrets on October 16, 2020, as the second single (and final track) from Bieber's sixth studio album, Justice (2021). It was later included on the 2021 reissue of Blanco's debut studio album, Friends Keep Secrets (2018). The song was written by Bieber, Blanco, and Finneas, with production handled by the latter two. At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards \"Lonely\" received a nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.[1]\n \"Lonely\" marks the fifth collaboration between Bieber and Blanco, but it is the first where Blanco is credited as an artist. Past Bieber songs where Blanco is credited as a producer and songwriter include \"Eenie Meenie\" and \"Somebody to Love\" in 2010, \"Love Yourself\" in 2015, and \"Cold Water\" in 2016. \"When [Blanco] and [Finneas] showed me this song to be honest it was hard to listen to considering how tough it was to get through some of these chapters,\" Bieber wrote of the song.[2][3] At one point, Bieber broke down and cried in the studio.[4] \"I went into the studio and sang through it which wasn't easy but started to really see the importance of telling this story! It made me realise we all feel lonely at times! Being someone in my position I believe it is powerful to express vulnerability and that's why I believe this song is so powerful!\"[5][6] Speaking of the song, Blanco revealed that Bieber was \"real nervous\", and contemplated on whether to release the song. \"Because he's like, 'People know me for this thing and it's like I've never been this raw.' He's raw on this song. This song brought us so much closer together. And it was just he's really opening up on this and he's super vulnerable.\"[7]\n \"Lonely\" is a pop ballad that is set in the key of B minor with a tempo of 80 beats per minute.[8][9] It contains a minimalist arrangement and a somber electric piano accompaniment.[10] It has a length of two minutes and twenty-nine seconds.[11] Lyrically, Bieber reflects on the effects of money and fame,[12] as well as the obstacles he faced during his early career,[13] including some perceptions and criticisms he had to deal with as he was gaining fame in his teenage years, and the feelings of isolation and loneliness he experienced as he failed to find anyone who could relate to his situation and provide him with emotional support.[14][15][16] He also admits to the wrongdoings he has committed along the way.[17]\n The song was first hinted at by Blanco on October 5, 2020, when he posted a series of pictures on Instagram, including one with his head photoshopped onto Bieber's advertisement for Calvin Klein underwear. There was also a picture of Blanco standing in front of a real-life billboard with the photoshopped ad.[18] On October 9, Bieber posted a short clip on social media, which features himself, Blanco and American rapper Lil Dicky. The post reads: \"Next week\u00a0...\" Blanco posted the full version of that clip, which sees Lil Dicky arriving at Blanco's mansion and being welcomed with an array of odd phrases, before being greeted by Bieber who was awaiting him inside the house.[19] He also teases a release \"next week\".[20] On October 12, 2020, Bieber and Blanco confirmed the song and its release, along with the artwork and a link for pre-saving the song on digital download and streaming services.[21] He also posted a short snippet of the song on his Instagram Stories,[10] and shared a still from the music video.[22] On October 15, almost a day before the official release time, an early snippet of \"Lonely\" was made available exclusively in Snapchat's \"Featured Sounds\" list of its new feature called Sounds,[23] which allows users to add licensed music to their Snaps.[24][25][26]\n \"Lonely\" debuted at number one on the Canadian Hot 100 issued for October\u00a031, 2020.[27] Music Canada certified the song 2\u00d7 platinum.[28] On the US Billboard Hot 100, it peaked at number 12;[29] it earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which denotes one million units based on sales and track-equivalent on-demand streams.[30] \"Lonely\" reached number 17 on the UK Singles Chart, and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it silver.[31][32] In Australia, the song charted at number 11 and went platinum.[33][34] It peaked at number 12 in New Zealand.[35] \"Lonely\" peaked within the top five of national record charts, at number one in Hungary,[36] Malaysia[37] and Norway,[38] number two in the Netherlands,[39] number four in Denmark[40] and Singapore,[41] and number five in Portugal[42] and Switzerland.[43] The song received a gold certification in Italy,[44] Norway,[45] and Spain,[46] as well as a double platinum certification in Portugal.[47]\n The music video premiered on YouTube at 9 pm PDT alongside the single on October 15, 2020.[24][48] It was directed by American music video director Jake Schreier and stars Canadian actor Jacob Tremblay, who plays a younger version of Bieber.[49][50] In an interview with etalk, Tremblay said that starring in a Justin Bieber music video \"is something [he] would have never seen coming\". He explained that Bieber's team reached out about the role, and Bieber later texted him to ask if he had any questions. The two ultimately agreed to chat over the phone to address Tremblay's questions, but they did not schedule an exact time, so Bieber ended up calling him when he was in a grocery store. \"I was like, to my parents, 'I have to go outside because Justin Bieber's calling me.'\" Tremblay also revealed that he was nervous about starring in the video, because he had never played a real person before. \"I've always played made-up characters, so I just really wanted to make sure that I had the feelings of the song and how Justin wanted me to feel. I really got to understand\u2014it's a bit more of a serious song but I'm really excited for people to hear it, so they can see the story. It's really good.\"[51]\n Bieber praised Jacob Tremblay for his talent, adding that he became emotional when he saw Tremblay play himself, while he acts as a spectator \"from the outside looking in\".[52] In a livestream on Bieber's YouTube channel after the song's release, both Bieber and Blanco called Tremblay one of the best child actors they have ever seen. \"The first time I watched him go through the segment\u00a0... I legitimately lost it,\" Justin said of witnessing Tremblay on set. \"I was tearing up, like completely.\"[53]\n On October 27, 2020, an acoustic video for \"Lonely\" was released. Directed by Schreier,[54] the video sees Blanco playing on a Wurlitzer electronic piano, with Bieber singing beside him while sitting in front of a mic in a recording studio.[55][56]\n The video opens with Tremblay sitting alone in a dressing room, staring at himself in the mirror.[57][58] He is dressed like Bieber in the early days of his career,[59] with bowl-style side-swept hair,[60] a purple hoodie,[61][62] white denim jacket and pants,[63][64] and a pair of purple sneakers.[18] Blanco makes an appearance as he enters the room to notify Tremblay it is time to get on stage.[65] Tremblay then proceeds to pick up a hockey stick and practice hockey briefly, before exiting the dressing room.[66] As the video progresses, Tremblay walks around the backstage by himself, and ultimately ends up on stage facing an empty theater, mouthing the lyrics \"I'm so lonely\".[67] As the camera zooms out, Bieber is revealed to be the only member of the audience, watching Tremblay's performance in his seat with a blank expression,[68][69] reflecting on and judging his own past.[13][70]\n Credits adapted from YouTube.[48]\n On October 17, 2020, Bieber and Blanco performed \"Lonely\" live, alongside Bieber's previous single, \"Holy\", featuring American rapper Chance the Rapper, the lead and previous single from Justice on Saturday Night Live. Both songs were performed live for the first time.[13][71][72] Instead of performing in a traditional stage setup, Bieber started his performance in a backstage dressing room. He sang to himself in a mirror, before wandering through the dimly lit, empty hallways of Studio 8H.[73][74][75] He eventually made his way onto the stage under a singular spotlight,[76][77][78] with Blanco on the piano.[79] At the end of the performance, he kept his head down for a bit, then walked over to give Blanco a hug.[80] On November 15, 2020, Bieber and Blanco performed the song at the 46th ceremony of the People's Choice Awards.[81][82][83] The performance began with Bieber sitting alone at a bus stop on an empty city street,[84][85] with Blanco off to the side playing the keyboard.[86][87][88] On November 22, 2020, Bieber and Blanco gave another live performance of the song at the American Music Awards of 2020.[89][90][91] Bieber, dressed in a blue plaid shirt and orange beanie,[92] performed the song on a stage surrounded by mirrors,[93] while Blanco played the keyboard behind him.[94][95]\n \n  Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.

Most comments and PS calculators, (software you can find online or downloads) say to upgrade to at least 3-times the minimum calculated and don't be too frugal about cost.\u00a0 You can't really over do it, the system will demand only what it needs but a good PS will also help protect the entire system from Power Surges which can and will happen, e.g. thunderstorm power surges, interruptions from unforeseen conditions like snowstorm outages suddenly causing stuttering power/on/off/on....etc. Hope this helps."], "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices": [" \n Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California, that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets. While it initially manufactured its own processors, the company later outsourced its manufacturing, a practice known as going fabless, after GlobalFoundries was spun off in 2009. AMD's main products include microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded processors, graphics processors, and FPGAs for servers, workstations, personal computers, and embedded system applications.\n Advanced Micro Devices was formally incorporated by Jerry Sanders, along with seven of his colleagues from Fairchild Semiconductor, on May 1, 1969.[2][3] Sanders, an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing at Fairchild, had, like many Fairchild executives, grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support, opportunity, and flexibility within the company. He later decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company,[4] following the footsteps of Robert Noyce (developer of the first silicon integrated circuit at Fairchild in 1959)[5] and Gordon Moore, who together founded the semiconductor company Intel in July 1968.[6]\n In September 1969, AMD moved from its temporary location in Santa Clara to Sunnyvale, California.[7] To immediately secure a customer base, AMD initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by Fairchild and National Semiconductor.[8][9] AMD first focused on producing logic chips.[10] The company guaranteed quality control to United States Military Standard, an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers \u2013 including computer manufacturers, the telecommunications industry, and instrument manufacturers \u2013 wanted to avoid.[8][11][12][13]\n In November 1969, the company manufactured its first product: the Am9300, a 4-bit MSI shift register, which began selling in 1970.[13][14] Also in 1970, AMD produced its first proprietary product, the Am2501 logic counter, which was highly successful.[15][16] Its best-selling product in 1971 was the Am2505, the fastest multiplier available.[15][17]\n In 1971, AMD entered the RAM chip market, beginning with the Am3101, a 64-bit bipolar RAM.[17][18] That year AMD also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits, and by year-end the company's total annual sales reached US$4.6 million.[15][19]\n AMD went public in September 1972.[8][20][21] The company was a second source for Intel MOS/LSI circuits by 1973, with products such as Am14/1506 and Am14/1507, dual 100-bit dynamic shift registers.[22][23] By 1975, AMD was producing 212 products \u2013 of which 49 were proprietary, including the Am9102 (a static N-channel 1024-bit RAM)[24] and three low-power Schottky MSI circuits: Am25LS07, Am25LS08, and Am25LS09.[25]\n Intel had created the first microprocessor, its 4-bit 4004, in 1971.[26][27] By 1975, AMD entered the microprocessor market with the Am9080, a reverse-engineered clone of the Intel 8080,[28][29][30] and the Am2900 bit-slice microprocessor family.[29] When Intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in 1976, it entered into a cross-licensing agreement with AMD, which was granted a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals, effective October 1976.[25][31][32][33][34]\n In 1977, AMD entered into a joint venture with Siemens, a German engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the American market.[35] Siemens purchased 20% of AMD's stock, giving the company an infusion of cash to increase its product lines.[35][36][37] The two companies also jointly established Advanced Micro Computers (AMC), located in Silicon Valley and in Germany, allowing AMD to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field,[35][38][39][40] in particular based on AMD's second-source Zilog Z8000 microprocessors.[41][42] When the two companies' vision for Advanced Micro Computers diverged, AMD bought out Siemens' stake in the American division in 1979.[43][44] AMD closed Advanced Micro Computers in late 1981 after switching focus to manufacturing second-source Intel x86 microprocessors.[41][45][46]\n Total sales in fiscal year 1978 topped $100 million,[38] and in 1979, AMD debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.[16] In 1979, production also began on AMD's new semiconductor fabrication plant in Austin, Texas;[16] the company already had overseas assembly facilities in Penang and Manila,[47] and began construction on a fabrication plant in San Antonio in 1981.[48] In 1980, AMD began supplying semiconductor products for telecommunications, an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation.[49]\n Intel had introduced the first x86 microprocessors in 1978.[50] In 1981, IBM created its PC, and wanted Intel's x86 processors, but only under the condition that Intel also provide a second-source manufacturer for its patented x86 microprocessors.[11] Intel and AMD entered into a 10-year technology exchange agreement, first signed in October 1981[45][51] and formally executed in February 1982.[34] The terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a second-source manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other; that is, each party could \"earn\" the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other, if agreed to, by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity. The technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company.[33] The 1982 agreement also extended the 1976 AMD\u2013Intel cross-licensing agreement through 1995.[33][34] The agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements, and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one year's notice.[33] The main result of the 1982 agreement was that AMD became a second-source manufacturer of Intel's x86 microprocessors and related chips, and Intel provided AMD with database tapes for its 8086, 80186, and 80286 chips.[34] However, in the event of a bankruptcy or takeover of AMD, the cross-licensing agreement would be effectively cancelled.[52]\n Beginning in 1982, AMD began volume-producing second-source Intel-licensed 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188 processors, and by 1984, its own Am286 clone of Intel's 80286 processor, for the rapidly growing market of IBM PCs and IBM clones.[11][53] It also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips.[54] In 1983, it introduced INT.STD.1000, the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry.[13][48]\n The company continued to spend greatly on research and development,[55] and created the world's first 512K EPROM in 1984.[56] That year, AMD was listed in the book The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America,[48][57] and later made the Fortune 500 list for the first time in 1985.[58][59]\n By mid-1985, the microchip market experienced a severe downturn, mainly due to long-term aggressive trade practices (dumping) from Japan, but also due to a crowded and non-innovative chip market in the United States.[60] AMD rode out the mid-1980s crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing,[61] devising the Liberty Chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chipset per week for 52 weeks in fiscal year 1986,[48][62] and by heavily lobbying the U.S. government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory Japanese pricing.[63] During this time, AMD withdrew from the DRAM market,[64] and made some headway into the CMOS market, which it had lagged in entering, having focused instead on bipolar chips.[65]\n AMD had some success in the mid-1980s with the AMD7910 and AMD7911 \"World Chip\" FSK modem, one of the first multi-standard devices that covered both Bell and CCITT tones at up to 1200 baud half duplex or 300/300 full duplex.[66] Beginning in 1986, AMD embraced the perceived shift toward RISC with their own AMD Am29000 (29k) processor;[67] the 29k survived as an embedded processor.[68][69] The company also increased its EPROM memory market share in the late 1980s.[70] Throughout the 1980s, AMD was a second-source supplier of Intel x86 processors. In 1991, it introduced its own 386-compatible Am386, an AMD-designed chip. Creating its own chips, AMD began to compete directly with Intel.[71]\n AMD had a large, successful flash memory business, even during the dotcom bust.[72] In 2003, to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow, which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from Intel, AMD spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into Spansion, a joint venture with Fujitsu, which had been co-manufacturing flash memory with AMD since 1993.[73][74] In December 2005, AMD divested itself of Spansion in order to focus on the microprocessor market, and Spansion went public in an IPO.[75]\n On July 24, 2006, AMD announced its acquisition of the Canadian 3d graphics card company ATI Technologies. AMD paid $4.3\u00a0billion and 58\u00a0million shares of its stock, for a total of approximately $5.4\u00a0billion. The transaction was completed on October 25, 2006.[76] On August 30, 2010, AMD announced that it would retire the ATI brand name for its graphics chipsets in favor of the AMD brand name.[77][78]\n In October 2008, AMD announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of GlobalFoundries Inc., a multibillion-dollar joint venture with Advanced Technology Investment Co., an investment company formed by the government of Abu Dhabi. The partnership and spin-off gave AMD an infusion of cash and allowed it to focus solely on chip design.[79] To assure the Abu Dhabi investors of the new venture's success, AMD's CEO Hector Ruiz stepped down in July 2008, while remaining executive chairman, in preparation for becoming chairman of GlobalFoundries in March 2009.[80][81] President and COO Dirk Meyer became AMD's CEO.[82] Recessionary losses necessitated AMD cutting 1,100 jobs in 2009.[83]\n In August 2011, AMD announced that former Lenovo executive Rory Read would be joining the company as CEO, replacing Meyer.[84] In November 2011, AMD announced plans to lay off more than 10% (1,400) of its employees from across all divisions worldwide.[85] In October 2012, it announced plans to lay off an additional 15% of its workforce to reduce costs in the face of declining sales revenue.[86]\n AMD acquired the low-power server manufacturer SeaMicro in early 2012, with an eye to bringing out an Arm64 server chip.[87]\n On October 8, 2014, AMD announced that Rory Read had stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer.[88] He was succeeded by Lisa Su, a key lieutenant who had been serving as chief operating officer since June.[89]\n On October 16, 2014, AMD announced a new restructuring plan along with its Q3 results. Effective July 1, 2014, AMD reorganized into two business groups: Computing and Graphics, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; and Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. As part of this restructuring, AMD announced that 7% of its global workforce would be laid off by the end of 2014.[90]\n After the GlobalFoundries spin-off and subsequent layoffs, AMD was left with significant vacant space at 1 AMD Place, its aging Sunnyvale headquarters office complex. In August 2016, AMD's 47 years in Sunnyvale came to a close when it signed a lease with the Irvine Company for a new 220,000 sq. ft. headquarters building in Santa Clara.[91] AMD's new location at Santa Clara Square faces the headquarters of archrival Intel across the Bayshore Freeway and San Tomas Aquino Creek. Around the same time, AMD also agreed to sell 1 AMD Place to the Irvine Company.[92] In April 2019, the Irvine Company secured approval from the Sunnyvale City Council of its plans to demolish 1 AMD Place and redevelop the entire 32-acre site into townhomes and apartments.[92]\n In October 2020, AMD announced that it was acquiring Xilinx in an all-stock transaction. The acquisition was completed in February 2022, with an estimated acquisition price of $50 billion.[93][94]\n Am2900 series (1975)\n AMD 29000 series (1987\u201395)\n Am386 Amx86 series (1991\u201395)\n K5 architecture (1996)\n K6 architecture (1997\u20132001)\n Bulldozer Series CPUs Bulldozer, Piledriver, Steamroller, Excavator (2011\u20132017)\n Bobcat series APUs Bobcat, Jaguar, Puma (2011\u2013present)\n Zen core architecture (2017)\n Zen+ series (released 2018)\n Zen 3 series (released 2020)\n In February 1982, AMD signed a contract with Intel, becoming a licensed second-source manufacturer of 8086 and 8088 processors. IBM wanted to use the Intel 8088 in its IBM PC, but its policy at the time was to require at least two sources for its chips. AMD later produced the Am286 under the same arrangement. In 1984, Intel internally decided to no longer cooperate with AMD in supplying product information in order to shore up its advantage in the marketplace, and delayed and eventually refused to convey the technical details of the Intel 80386.[95] In 1987, AMD invoked arbitration over the issue, and Intel reacted by canceling the 1982 technological-exchange agreement altogether.[96][97] After three years of testimony, AMD eventually won in arbitration in 1992, but Intel disputed this decision. Another long legal dispute followed, ending in 1994 when the Supreme Court of California sided with the arbitrator and AMD.[98][99]\n In 1990, Intel countersued AMD, renegotiating AMD's right to use derivatives of Intel's microcode for its cloned processors.[100] In the face of uncertainty during the legal dispute, AMD was forced to develop clean room designed versions of Intel code for its x386 and x486 processors, the former long after Intel had released its own x386 in 1985.[101] In March 1991, AMD released the Am386, its clone of the Intel 386 processor.[48] By October of the same year it had sold one million units.[48]\n In 1993, AMD introduced the first of the Am486 family of processors,[16] which proved popular with a large number of original equipment manufacturers, including Compaq, which signed an exclusive agreement using the Am486.[8][102][103] The Am5x86, another Am486-based processor, was released in November 1995, and continued AMD's success as a fast, cost-effective processor.[104][105]\n Finally, in an agreement effective 1996, AMD received the rights to the microcode in Intel's x386 and x486 processor families, but not the rights to the microcode in the following generations of processors.[106][107]\n AMD's first in-house x86 processor was the K5, launched in 1996.[108] The \"K\" in its name was a reference to Kryptonite, the only substance known to harm comic book character Superman. This itself was a reference to Intel's hegemony over the market, i.e., an anthropomorphization of them as Superman.[109] The number \"5\" was a reference to the fifth generation of x86 processors; rival Intel had previously introduced its line of fifth-generation x86 processors as Pentium because the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked.[110]\n In 1996, AMD purchased NexGen, specifically for the rights to their Nx series of x86-compatible processors. AMD gave the NexGen design team their own building, left them alone, and gave them time and money to rework the Nx686. The result was the K6 processor, introduced in 1997. Although it was based on Socket 7, variants such as K6-3/450 were faster than Intel's Pentium II (sixth-generation processor).\n The K7 was AMD's seventh-generation x86 processor, making its debut under the brand name Athlon on June 23, 1999. Unlike previous AMD processors, it could not be used on the same motherboards as Intel's, due to licensing issues surrounding Intel's Slot 1 connector, and instead used a Slot A connector, referenced to the Alpha processor bus. The Duron was a lower-cost and limited version of the Athlon (64KB instead of 256KB L2 cache) in a 462-pin socketed PGA (socket A) or soldered directly onto the motherboard. Sempron was released as a lower-cost Athlon XP, replacing Duron in the socket A PGA era. It has since been migrated upward to all new sockets, up to AM3.\n On October 9, 2001, the Athlon XP was released. On February 10, 2003, the Athlon XP with 512KB L2 Cache was released.[111]\n The K8 was a major revision of the K7 architecture, with the most notable features being the addition of a 64-bit extension to the x86 instruction set (called x86-64, AMD64, or x64), the incorporation of an on-chip memory controller, and the implementation of an extremely high-performance point-to-point interconnect called HyperTransport, as part of the Direct Connect Architecture. The technology was initially launched as the Opteron server-oriented processor on April 22, 2003.[112] Shortly thereafter, it was incorporated into a product for desktop PCs, branded Athlon 64.[113]\n On April 21, 2005, AMD released the first dual-core Opteron, an x86-based server CPU.[114] A month later, it released the Athlon 64 X2, the first desktop-based dual-core processor family.[115] In May 2007, AMD abandoned the string \"64\" in its dual-core desktop product branding, becoming Athlon X2, downplaying the significance of 64-bit computing in its processors. Further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture, and a shift of the target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dual-core desktop systems. In 2008, AMD started to release dual-core Sempron processors exclusively in China, branded as the Sempron 2000 series, with lower HyperTransport speed and smaller L2 cache. AMD completed its dual-core product portfolio for each market segment.\n In September 2007, AMD released the first server Opteron K10 processors,[116] followed in November by the Phenom processor for desktop. K10 processors came in dual-core, triple-core,[117] and quad-core versions, with all cores on a single die. AMD released a new platform codenamed \"Spider\", which utilized the new Phenom processor, as well as an R770 GPU and a 790 GX/FX chipset from the AMD 700 chipset series.[118] However, AMD built the Spider at 65nm, which was uncompetitive with Intel's smaller and more power-efficient 45nm.\n In January 2009, AMD released a new processor line dubbed Phenom II, a refresh of the original Phenom built using the 45\u00a0nm process.[119] AMD's new platform, codenamed \"Dragon\", utilized the new Phenom II processor, and an ATI R770 GPU from the R700 GPU family, as well as a 790 GX/FX chipset from the AMD 700 chipset series.[120] The Phenom II came in dual-core, triple-core and quad-core variants, all using the same die, with cores disabled for the triple-core and dual-core versions. The Phenom II resolved issues that the original Phenom had, including a low clock speed, a small L3 cache, and a Cool'n'Quiet bug that decreased performance. The Phenom II cost less but was not performance-competitive with Intel's mid-to-high-range Core 2 Quads. The Phenom II also enhanced its predecessor's memory controller, allowing it to use DDR3 in a new native socket AM3, while maintaining backward compatibility with AM2+, the socket used for the Phenom, and allowing the use of the DDR2 memory that was used with the platform.\n In April 2010, AMD released a new Phenom II Hexa-core (6-core) processor codenamed \"Thuban\".[121] This was a totally new die based on the hexa-core \"Istanbul\" Opteron processor. It included AMD's \"turbo core\" technology, which allows the processor to automatically switch from 6 cores to 3 faster cores when more pure speed is needed.\n The Magny Cours and Lisbon server parts were released in 2010.[122] The Magny Cours part came in 8 to 12\u00a0cores and the Lisbon part in 4 and 6\u00a0core parts. Magny Cours is focused on performance while the Lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt. Magny Cours is an MCM (multi-chip module) with two hexa-core \"Istanbul\" Opteron parts. This will use a new G34 socket for dual and quad-socket processors and thus will be marketed as Opteron 61xx series processors. Lisbon uses C32 socket certified for dual-socket use or single socket use only and thus will be marketed as Opteron 41xx processors. Both will be built on a 45 nm SOI process.\n Following AMD's 2006 acquisition of Canadian graphics company ATI Technologies, an initiative codenamed Fusion was announced to integrate a CPU and GPU together on some of AMD's microprocessors, including a built in PCI Express link to accommodate separate PCI Express peripherals, eliminating the northbridge chip from the motherboard. The initiative intended to move some of the processing originally done on the CPU (e.g. floating-point unit operations) to the GPU, which is better optimized for some calculations. The Fusion was later renamed the AMD APU (Accelerated Processing Unit).[123]\n Llano was AMD's first APU built for laptops. Llano was the second APU released,[124] targeted at the mainstream market.[123] It incorporated a CPU and GPU on the same die, as well as northbridge functions, and used \"Socket FM1\" with DDR3 memory. The CPU part of the processor was based on the Phenom II \"Deneb\" processor. AMD suffered an unexpected decrease in revenue based on production problems for the Llano.[125] More AMD APUs for laptops running Windows 7 and Windows 8 OS are being used commonly. These include AMD's price-point APUs, the E1 and E2, and their mainstream competitors with Intel's core i-series: The Vision A- series, the A standing for accelerated. These range from the lower-performance A4 chipset to the A6, A8, and A10. These all incorporate Next-generation Radeon graphics cards, with the A4 utilizing the base Radeon HD chip and the rest using a Radeon R4 graphics card, with the exception of the highest-model A10 (A10-7300) which uses an R6 graphics card.\n Bulldozer was AMD's microarchitecture codename for server and desktop AMD FX processors, first released on October 12, 2011. This family 15h microarchitecture is the successor to the family 10h (K10) microarchitecture design. Bulldozer was a clean-sheet design, not a development of earlier processors.[126] The core was specifically aimed at 10\u2013125\u00a0W TDP computing products. AMD claimed dramatic performance-per-watt efficiency improvements in high-performance computing (HPC) applications with Bulldozer cores. While hopes were high that Bulldozer would bring AMD to be performance-competitive with Intel once more, most benchmarks were disappointing. In some cases the new Bulldozer products were slower than the K10 models they were built to replace.[127][128][129]\n The Piledriver microarchitecture was the 2012 successor to Bulldozer, increasing clock speeds and performance relative to its predecessor.[130] Piledriver would be released in AMD FX, APU, and Opteron product lines.[131][132][133][134] Piledriver was subsequently followed by the Steamroller microarchitecture in 2013. Used exclusively in AMD's APUs, Steamroller focused on greater parallelism.[135][136]\n In 2015, the Excavator microarchitecture replaced Piledriver.[137] Expected to be the last microarchitecture of the Bulldozer series,[138][139] Excavator focused on improved power efficiency.[140]\n The Bobcat microarchitecture was revealed during a speech from AMD executive vice-president Henri Richard in Computex 2007 and was put into production during the first quarter of 2011.[124] Based on the difficulty competing in the x86 market with a single core optimized for the 10\u2013100\u00a0W range, AMD had developed a simpler core with a target range of 1\u201310\u00a0watts.[141] In addition, it was believed that the core could migrate into the hand-held space if the power consumption can be reduced to less than 1\u00a0W.[142]\n Jaguar is a microarchitecture codename for Bobcat's successor, released in 2013, that is used in various APUs from AMD aimed at the low-power/low-cost market.[143] Jaguar and its derivates would go on to be used in the custom APUs of the PlayStation 4,[144][145] Xbox One,[146][147] PlayStation 4 Pro,[148][149][150] Xbox One S,[151] and Xbox One X.[152][153] Jaguar would be later followed by the Puma microarchitecture in 2014.[154]\n In 2012, AMD announced it was working on Arm products, both as a semi-custom product and server product.[155][156][157] The initial server product was announced as the Opteron A1100 in 2014, and 8-core Cortex-A57 based ARMv8-A SoC,[158][159] and was expected to be followed by an APU incorporating a Graphic Core Next GPU.[160] However, the Opteron A1100 was not released until 2016, with the delay attributed to adding software support.[161] The A1100 was also criticized for not having support from major vendors upon its release.[161][162][163]\n In 2014, AMD also announced the K12 custom core for release in 2016.[164] While being ARMv8-A instruction set architecture compliant, the K12 is expected to be entirely custom designed targeting server, embedded, and semi-custom markets. While ARM architecture development continued, products based on K12 were subsequently delayed with no release planned, in preference to the development of AMD's x86-based Zen microarchitecture.[165][166]\n Zen is a new architecture for x86-64 based Ryzen series CPUs and APUs, introduced in 2017 by AMD and built from the ground up by a team led by Jim Keller, beginning with his arrival in 2012, and taping out before his departure in September 2015. One of AMD's primary goals with Zen was an IPC increase of at least 40%, however in February 2017 AMD announced that they had actually achieved a 52% increase.[167][failed verification] Processors made on the Zen architecture are built on the 14\u00a0nm FinFET node and have a renewed focus on single-core performance and HSA compatibility.[168] Previous processors from AMD were either built in the 32\u00a0nm process (\"Bulldozer\" and \"Piledriver\" CPUs) or the 28\u00a0nm process (\"Steamroller\" and \"Excavator\" APUs). Because of this, Zen is much more energy efficient. The Zen architecture is the first to encompass CPUs and APUs from AMD built for a single socket (Socket AM4). Also new for this architecture is the implementation of simultaneous multithreading (SMT) technology, something Intel has had for years on some of their processors with their proprietary Hyper-Threading implementation of SMT. This is a departure from the \"Clustered MultiThreading\" design introduced with the Bulldozer architecture. Zen also has support for DDR4 memory. AMD released the Zen-based high-end Ryzen 7 \"Summit Ridge\" series CPUs on March 2, 2017,[169] mid-range Ryzen 5 series CPUs on April 11, 2017, and entry level Ryzen 3 series CPUs on July 27, 2017.[170] AMD later released the Epyc line of Zen derived server processors for 1P and 2P systems.[171] In October 2017, AMD released Zen-based APUs as Ryzen Mobile, incorporating Vega graphics cores.[172] In January 2018 AMD has announced their new lineup plans, with Ryzen 2.[173] AMD launched CPUs with the 12nm Zen+[174] microarchitecture in April 2018, following up with the 7nm Zen 2 microarchitecture in June 2019, including an update to the Epyc line with new processors using the Zen 2 microarchitecture in August 2019, and Zen 3 slated for release in Q3 2020. As of 2019, AMD's Ryzen processors were reported to outsell Intel's consumer desktop processors.[175] At CES 2020 AMD announced their Ryzen Mobile 4000, as the first 7\u00a0nm x86 mobile processor,[vague] the first 7\u00a0nm 8-core (also 16-thread) high-performance mobile processor, and the first 8-core (also 16-thread) processor for ultrathin laptops.[176] This generation is still based on the Zen 2 architecture. In October 2020 AMD announced their Zen 3 CPU.[177] On PassMark's Single thread performance test the Ryzen 5 5600x bested all other CPUs besides the Ryzen 9 5950X.[178]\n The Steam Deck,[179][180] PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S all use chips based on the Zen 2 microarchitecture, with proprietary tweaks and different configurations in each system's implementation than AMD sells in its own commercially available APUs.[181][182]\n Radeon R200 series (2001)\n Radeon R500 (2005)\n Radeon HD 2000 series (2007a)\n Radeon HD 3000 series (2007b)\n Radeon HD 4000 series (2008)\n Radeon HD 5000 series (2009)\n Radeon HD 6000 series (2010)\n Radeon HD 7000 series (2012)\n Radeon Rx 200 series (2013)\n Radeon RX 400 series (2016)\n Radeon RX 500 series (2016)\n Radeon RX Vega series (released 2017)\n Radeon RX 5000 series (released 2019)\n Radeon RX 6000 series (released 2020)\n Lee Ka Lau,[183] Francis Lau, Benny Lau, and Kwok Yuen Ho[184] founded ATI in 1985 as Array Technology Inc.[185]\nWorking primarily in the OEM field, ATI produced integrated graphics cards for PC manufacturers such as IBM and Commodore. By 1987, ATI had grown into an independent graphics-card retailer, introducing EGA Wonder and VGA Wonder card product lines that year.[186] In the early nineties, they released products able to process graphics without the CPU: in May 1991, the Mach8, in 1992 the Mach32, which offered improved memory bandwidth and GUI acceleration. ATI Technologies Inc. went public in 1993, with shares listed on NASDAQ and on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n In 1994, the Mach64 accelerator debuted, powering the Graphics Xpression and Graphics Pro Turbo, offering hardware support for YUV-to-RGB color space conversion in addition to hardware zoom; early techniques of hardware-based video acceleration.\n ATI introduced its first combination of 2D and 3D accelerator under the name 3D Rage. This chip was based on the Mach 64, but it featured elemental 3D acceleration. The ATI Rage line powered almost the entire range of ATI graphics products. In particular, the Rage Pro was one of the first viable 2D-plus-3D alternatives to 3dfx's 3D-only Voodoo chipset. 3D acceleration in the Rage line advanced from the basic functionality within the initial 3D Rage to a more advanced DirectX 6.0 accelerator in 1999 Rage 128.\n The All-in-Wonder product line, introduced in 1996, was the first combination of integrated graphics chip with TV tuner card and the first chip that enabled display of computer graphics on a TV set.[187] The cards featured 3D acceleration powered by ATI's 3D Rage II, 64-bit 2D performance, TV-quality video acceleration, analog video capture, TV tuner functionality, flicker-free TV-out and stereo TV audio reception.\n ATI entered the mobile computing sector by introducing 3D-graphics acceleration to laptops in 1996. The Mobility product line had to meet requirements different from those of desktop PCs, such as minimized power usage, reduced heat output, TMDS output capabilities for laptop screens, and maximized integration. In 1997, ATI acquired Tseng Labs's graphics assets, which included 40 engineers.\n The Radeon line of graphics products was unveiled in 2000. The initial Radeon graphics processing unit offered an all-new design with DirectX 7.0 3D acceleration, video acceleration, and 2D acceleration. Technology developed for a specific Radeon generation could be built in varying levels of features and performance in order to provide products suited for the entire market range, from high-end to budget to mobile versions.\n In 2000, ATI acquired ArtX, which engineered the Flipper graphics chip used in the Nintendo GameCube game console. They also created a modified version of the chip (codenamed Hollywood) for the successor of the GameCube, the Wii. Microsoft contracted ATI to design the graphics core (codenamed Xenos) for the Xbox 360. Later in 2005, ATI acquired Terayon's cable modem silicon intellectual property, strengthening their lead in the consumer digital television market.[188] K. Y. Ho remained as Chairman of the Board until he retired in November 2005. Dave Orton replaced him as the President and CEO of the organization.\n On July 24, 2006, a joint announcement revealed that Advanced Micro Devices would acquire ATI in a deal valued at $5.6 billion.[189] The acquisition consideration closed on October 25, 2006,[190] and included over $2 billion financed from a loan and 56 million shares of AMD stock.[191] ATI's operations became part of the AMD Graphics Product Group (GPG),[192] and ATI's CEO Dave Orton became the Executive Vice President of Visual and Media Businesses at AMD until his resignation in 2007.[193] The top-level management was reorganized with the Senior Vice President and General Manager, and the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Consumer Electronics Group, both of whom would report to the CEO of AMD.[194] On 30 August 2010, John Trikola announced that AMD would retire the ATI brand for its graphics chipsets in favor of the AMD name.[195]\n \n In 2008, the ATI division of AMD released the TeraScale microarchitecture implementing a unified shader model. This design replaced the previous fixed-function hardware of previous graphics cards with multipurpose, programmable shaders. Initially released as part of the GPU for the Xbox 360, this technology would go on to be used in Radeon branded HD 2000 parts. Three generations of TeraScale would be designed and used in parts from 2008 to 2014.\n In a 2009 restructuring, AMD merged the CPU and GPU divisions to support the company's APUs, which fused both graphics and general purpose processing.[196][197] In 2011, AMD released the successor to TeraScale, Graphics Core Next (GCN).[198] This new microarchitecture emphasized GPGPU compute capability in addition to graphics processing, with a particular aim of supporting heterogeneous computing on AMD's APUs. GCN's reduced instruction set ISA allowed for significantly increased compute capability over TeraScale's very long instruction word ISA. Since GCN's introduction with the HD 7970, five generations of the GCN architecture have been produced from 2008 through at least 2017.[199]\n In September 2015, AMD separated the graphics technology division of the company into an independent internal unit called the Radeon Technologies Group (RTG) headed by Raja Koduri.[200] This gave the graphics division of AMD autonomy in product design and marketing.[201][202] The RTG then went on to create and release the Polaris and Vega microarchitectures released in 2016 and 2017, respectively.[203][204] In particular the Vega, or fifth generation GCN, microarchitecture includes a number of major revisions to improve performance and compute capabilities.[205][206]\n In November 2017, Raja Koduri left RTG[207] and CEO and President Lisa Su took his position. In January 2018, it was reported that two industry veterans joined RTG, namely Mike Rayfield as senior vice president and general manager of RTG, and David Wang as senior vice president of engineering for RTG.[208] In January 2020, AMD announced that its second generation RDNA graphics architecture was in development, with the aim of competing with the Nvidia RTX graphics products for performance leadership. In October 2020, AMD announced their new RX 6000 series[209] series GPUs, their first high-end product based on RDNA2 and capable of handling ray-tracing natively, aiming to challenge Nvidia's RTX 3000 GPUs.\n In 2012, AMD's then CEO Rory Read began a program to offer semi-custom designs.[210][211] Rather than AMD simply designing and offering a single product, potential customers could work with AMD to design a custom chip based on AMD's intellectual property. Customers pay a non-recurring engineering fee for design and development, and a purchase price for the resulting semi-custom products. In particular, AMD noted their unique position of offering both x86 and graphics intellectual property. These semi-custom designs would have design wins as the APUs in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and the subsequent PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One S, Xbox One X, Xbox Series and PlayStation 5.[212][213][214][150][153][215] Financially, these semi-custom products would represent a majority of the company's revenue in 2016.[216][217] In November 2017, AMD and Intel announced that Intel would market a product combining in a single package an Intel Core CPU, a semi-custom AMD Radeon GPU, and HBM2 memory.[218]\n Before the launch of Athlon 64 processors in 2003, AMD designed chipsets for their processors spanning the K6 and K7 processor generations. The chipsets include the AMD-640, AMD-751, and the AMD-761 chipsets. The situation changed in 2003 with the release of Athlon 64 processors, and AMD chose not to further design its own chipsets for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design chipsets. This was the \"Open Platform Management Architecture\" with ATI, VIA and SiS developing their own chipset for Athlon 64 processors and later Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon 64 FX processors, including the Quad FX platform chipset from Nvidia.\n The initiative went further with the release of Opteron server processors as AMD stopped the design of server chipsets in 2004 after releasing the AMD-8111 chipset, and again opened the server platform for firms to develop chipsets for Opteron processors. As of today,[when?] Nvidia and Broadcom are the sole designing firms of server chipsets for Opteron processors.\n As the company completed the acquisition of ATI Technologies in 2006, the firm gained the ATI design team for chipsets which previously designed the Radeon Xpress 200 and the Radeon Xpress 3200 chipsets. AMD then renamed the chipsets for AMD processors under AMD branding (for instance, the CrossFire Xpress 3200 chipset was renamed as AMD 580X CrossFire chipset). In February 2007, AMD announced the first AMD-branded chipset since 2004 with the release of the AMD 690G chipset (previously under the development codename RS690), targeted at mainstream IGP computing. It was the industry's first to implement a HDMI 1.2 port on motherboards, shipping for more than a million units. While ATI had aimed at releasing an Intel IGP chipset, the plan was scrapped and the inventories of Radeon Xpress 1250 (codenamed RS600, sold under ATI brand) was sold to two OEMs, Abit and ASRock. Although AMD stated the firm would still produce Intel chipsets, Intel had not granted the license of 1333 MHz FSB to ATI.\n On November 15, 2007, AMD announced a new chipset series portfolio, the AMD 7-Series chipsets, covering from the enthusiast multi-graphics segment to the value IGP segment, to replace the AMD 480/570/580 chipsets and AMD 690 series chipsets, marking AMD's first enthusiast multi-graphics chipset.  Discrete graphics chipsets were launched on November 15, 2007, as part of the codenamed Spider desktop platform, and IGP chipsets were launched at a later time in spring 2008 as part of the codenamed Cartwheel platform.\n AMD returned to the server chipsets market with the AMD 800S series server chipsets. It includes support for up to six SATA 6.0 Gbit/s ports, the C6 power state, which is featured in Fusion processors and AHCI 1.2 with SATA FIS\u2013based switching support. This is a chipset family supporting Phenom processors and Quad FX enthusiast platform (890FX), IGP (890GX).\n With the advent of AMD's APUs in 2011, traditional northbridge features such as the connection to graphics and the PCI Express controller were incorporated into the APU die. Accordingly, APUs were connected to a single chip chipset, renamed the Fusion Controller Hub (FCH), which primarily provided southbridge functionality.[219]\n AMD released new chipsets in 2017 to support the release of their new Ryzen products. As the Zen microarchitecture already includes much of the northbridge connectivity, the AM4-based chipsets primarily varied in the number of additional PCI Express lanes, USB connections, and SATA connections available.[220] These AM4 chipsets were designed in conjunction with ASMedia.[221]\n In February 2002, AMD acquired Alchemy Semiconductor for its Alchemy line of MIPS processors for the hand-held and portable media player markets.[222] On June 13, 2006, AMD officially announced that the line was to be transferred to Raza Microelectronics, Inc., a designer of MIPS processors for embedded applications.[223]\n In August 2003, AMD also purchased the Geode business which was originally the Cyrix MediaGX from National Semiconductor to augment its existing line of embedded x86 processor products.[224] During the second quarter of 2004, it launched new low-power Geode NX processors based on the K7 Thoroughbred architecture with speeds of fanless processors 667 MHz and 1 GHz, and 1.4 GHz processor with fan, of TDP 25\u00a0W. This technology is used in a variety of embedded systems (Casino slot machines and customer kiosks for instance), several UMPC designs in Asia markets, as well as the OLPC XO-1 computer, an inexpensive laptop computer intended to be distributed to children in developing countries around the world.[225] The Geode LX processor was announced in 2005 and is said will continue to be available through 2015.[needs update]\n AMD has also introduced 64-bit processors into its embedded product line starting with the AMD Opteron processor. Leveraging the high throughput enabled through HyperTransport and the Direct Connect Architecture these server-class processors have been targeted at high-end telecom and storage applications. In 2007, AMD added the AMD Athlon, AMD Turion, and Mobile AMD Sempron processors to its embedded product line. Leveraging the same 64-bit instruction set and Direct Connect Architecture as the AMD Opteron but at lower power levels, these processors were well suited to a variety of traditional embedded applications. Throughout 2007 and into 2008, AMD has continued to add both single-core Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors and dual-core AMD Athlon X2 and AMD Turion processors to its embedded product line and now offers embedded 64-bit solutions starting with 8\u00a0W TDP Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors for fan-less designs up to multi-processor systems leveraging multi-core AMD Opteron processors all supporting longer than standard availability.[226]\n The ATI acquisition in 2006 included the Imageon and Xilleon product lines. In late 2008, the entire handheld division was sold off to Qualcomm, who have since produced the Adreno series.[227] Also in 2008, the Xilleon division was sold to Broadcom.[228][229]\n In April 2007, AMD announced the release of the M690T integrated graphics chipset for embedded designs. This enabled AMD to offer complete processor and chipset solutions targeted at embedded applications requiring high-performance 3D and video such as emerging digital signage, kiosk, and Point of Sale applications. The M690T was followed by the M690E specifically for embedded applications which removed the TV output, which required Macrovision licensing for OEMs, and enabled native support for dual TMDS outputs, enabling dual independent DVI interfaces.[citation needed][230]\n In January 2011, AMD announced the AMD Embedded G-Series Accelerated Processing Unit.[231][232] This was the first APU for embedded applications. These were followed by updates in 2013 and 2016.[233][234]\n In May 2012, AMD Announced the AMD Embedded R-Series Accelerated Processing Unit.[235]  This family of products incorporates the Bulldozer CPU architecture, and Discrete-class Radeon HD 7000G Series graphics. This was followed by a system on a chip (SoC) version in 2015 which offered a faster CPU and faster graphics, with support for DDR4 SDRAM memory.[236][237]\n AMD builds graphic processors for use in embedded systems. They can be found in anything from casinos to healthcare, with a large portion of products being used in industrial machines.[238] These products include a complete graphics processing device in a compact multi-chip module including RAM and the GPU.[239] ATI began offering embedded GPUs with the E2400 in 2008. Since that time AMD has released regular updates to their embedded GPU lineup in 2009, 2011, 2015, and 2016; reflecting improvements in their GPU technology.[239][240][241][242]\n AMD's portfolio of CPUs and APUs as of 2020[update]\n AMD's portfolio of dedicated graphics processors as of 2017[update]\n In 2011, AMD began selling Radeon branded DDR3 SDRAM to support the higher bandwidth needs of AMD's APUs.[244] While the RAM is sold by AMD, it was manufactured by Patriot Memory and VisionTek. This was later followed by higher speeds of gaming oriented DDR3 memory in 2013.[245] Radeon branded DDR4 SDRAM memory was released in 2015, despite no AMD CPUs or APUs supporting DDR4 at the time.[246] AMD noted in 2017 that these products are \"mostly distributed in Eastern Europe\" and that it continues to be active in the business.[247]\n AMD announced in 2014 it would sell Radeon branded solid-state drives manufactured by OCZ with capacities up to 480\u00a0GB and using the SATA interface.[248]\n As of 2017[update] technologies found in AMD CPU/APU and other products include:\n As of 2017[update] technologies found in AMD GPU products include:\n AMD has made considerable efforts towards opening its software tools above the firmware level in the past decade.[249][250][251]\n For the following mentions, software not expressely stated free can be assumed to be proprietary.\n AMD Radeon Software is the default channel for official software distribution from AMD. It includes both free and proprietary software components, and supports both Microsoft Windows and Linux.\n Most notable public AMD software is on the GPU side.\n AMD has opened both its graphic and compute stacks:\n Previously, AMD produced its chips at company-owned semiconductor foundries. AMD pursued a strategy of collaboration with other semiconductor manufacturers IBM and Motorola to co-develop production technologies.[259][260] AMD's founder Jerry Sanders termed this the \"Virtual Gorilla\" strategy to compete with Intel's significantly greater investments in fabrication.[261]\n In 2008, AMD spun off its chip foundries into an independent company named GlobalFoundries.[262] This break-up of the company was attributed to the increasing costs of each process node. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi purchased the newly created company through its subsidiary Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC), purchasing the final stake from AMD in 2009.[263]\n With the spin-off of its foundries, AMD became a fabless semiconductor manufacturer, designing products to be produced at for-hire foundries. Part of the GlobalFoundries spin-off included an agreement with AMD to produce some number of products at GlobalFoundries.[264] Both prior to the spin-off and after AMD has pursued production with other foundries including TSMC and Samsung.[265][266] It has been argued that this would reduce risk for AMD by decreasing dependence on any one foundry which has caused issues in the past.[266][267]\n In 2018, AMD started shifting the production of their CPUs and GPUs to TSMC, following GlobalFoundries' announcement that they were halting development of their 7 nm process.[268] AMD revised their wafer purchase requirement with GlobalFoundries in 2019, allowing AMD to freely choose foundries for 7\u00a0nm nodes and below, while maintaining purchase agreements for 12\u00a0nm and above through 2021.[269]\n AMD utilizes strategic industry partnerships to further its business interests as well as to rival Intel's dominance and resources:[259][260][261]\n AMD has a long history of litigation with former (and current) partner and x86 creator Intel.[287][288][289]\n Coordinates: 37\u00b022\u203256\u2033N 121\u00b058\u203215\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff37.38222\u00b0N

"https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/sata": [" \n(Serial ATA) The standard hardware interface for connecting storage and CD/DVD drives to the computer. Introduced in 2001, most computers for consumers use the SATA interface for hard drives. However, servers and high-end workstations may use SCSI (see serial attached SCSI), and solid state drives (SSDs) increasingly employ the NVMe interface rather than SATA (see NVMe).\n SATA is the faster serial version of the parallel ATA (PATA) interface. Both SATA and PATA are \"integrated drive electronics\" (IDE) devices, which means the controller is in the drive, and only a simple circuit is required on the motherboard. See IDE, mSATA and SATA Express.\n Advertisement PCMag.com is a leading authority on technology, delivering lab-based, independent reviews of the latest products and services.

We've received your submission. By Nicki Cox \nSubmit \n\n\n \u0394 \n No one writes a break-up song better than Taylor Swift \u2014 just ask Jake Gyllenhaal. The \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d singer has been known to share all of the highs and lows of each relationship through her lyrics, leaving fans trying to sleuth out which ex-boyfriend inspired which songs.  Following the re-recording and re-releasing of her past albums like \u201cFearless\u201d and \u201cRed,\u201d her past lovers have been making headlines again too.  Check out Swift\u2019s dating history below.  While their relationship in 2008 only lasted a couple of months, Taylor used the experience \u2014 including Jonas breaking up with her during a 25-second phone call \u2014 as inspiration for her second album, \u201cFearless.\u201d Songs such as \u201cForever & Always,\u201d \u201cLast Kiss,\u201d \u201cBetter Than Revenge\u201d and \u201cMr. Perfectly Fine\u201d were all written about the DNCE singer. She later went on to win her first Grammy for the album. \u201cYou might think I\u2019d bring up Joe, that guy who broke up with me on the phone. But I\u2019m not going to mention him in my monologue. Hey, Joe! I\u2019m doing really well and I\u2019m hosting \u2018SNL\u2019 \u2014 but I\u2019m not going to write about that in my monologue,\u201d sang Swift during her monologue the first time she hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d back in 2009.  Whether it was due to time \u2014 or the Grammy \u2014 the two seem to be on good terms as Jonas celebrated with Swift after her \u201cSNL\u201d appearance this past week. The pair co-starred in Swift\u2019s \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d music video back in 2009, but they met on the set of \u201cHannah Montana: The Movie,\u201d in which Swift had a small cameo. The pair split up months later saying they were better off being just friends.  Popularly known as \u201cTaylor Squared,\u201d the couple met while filming \u201cValentines Day\u201d where they played high-school love interests.  It\u2019s rumored that Lautner was more into Swift than she was into him, resulting in their breakup. Swift allegedly wrote \u201cBack to December\u201d about their romance where she seemingly tried to apologize to the \u201cTwilight\u201d star.  \u201cYou gave me roses, and I left them there to die / So this is me swallowing my pride, standing in front of you saying I\u2019m sorry for that night,\u201d wrote Swift in \u201cBack to December.\u201d \u201cYou gave me all of your love and all I gave you was goodbye\u201d  In a response to the song, Lautner later said, \u201cThat\u2019s just what she does.\u201d Ouch.  The late \u201cGlee\u201d star and Swift only dated for about a month, but he still earned a sweet love song from the singer. It\u2019s been alleged the song \u201cMine,\u201d about a sweet boy she barely knows, is about Monteith.  Dear John, how could you forget this one?  The two dated for just a couple months after collaborating on \u201cHalf of My Heart.\u201d Swift, who was 20, later called the \u201cGravity\u201d singer, then 32, out in a song titled \u201cDear John\u201d. \u201cDear John, I see it all now, it was wrong / don\u2019t you think 19 is too young to be played by your dark twisted games,\u201d Swift sang on the track. Mayer later responded to the song in an interview with Rolling Stone, stating, \u201cI will say as a songwriter that I think it\u2019s kind of cheap songwriting.\u201d Do you remember it \u201cAll Too Well\u201d now, Jake? Even though they only dated for three months in 2010, Swift had a lot to say about the actor in her album \u201cRed,\u201d which she recently re-released \u2014 including a scathing 10-minute version of \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d a song about the couple\u2019s breakup.  It\u2019s also said that he inspired the songs, \u201cWe Are Never Getting Back Together,\u201d \u201cState of Grace,\u201d and \u201cThe Moment I Knew.\u201d At the time Swift, 20, was blindsided when Gyllenhaal, 29, broke up with her via text, claiming the age gap was too much for the \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d actor.  Swift also recently released a short film to \u201cAll Too Well\u201d that shows the timeline of the couple\u2019s romance. Swift dated Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s grandson, Conor Kennedy, for a few short months back in 2012.  The unlikely duo did raise a couple of eyebrows given their respective ages at the time \u2014 Swift being 22 and Kennedy just 18.  Swift was a longtime fan of the Kennedys even before meeting Conor. She even wrote a song about Robert [Bobby] Kennedy and his wife Ethel\u2019s courtship called \u201cStarlight.\u201d Known as \u201cHaylor,\u201d the pair made their first public appearance in December of 2015 going for a stroll in Central Park. \u201cSwifties\u201d and \u201cDirectioners\u201d at the time went crazy about the new romance, but the excitement was short-lived, and the couple broke up after 3 months.  That same year Taylor seemingly lobbed a shot at Styles \u2014 sitting in the crowd during her performance of \u201cWe Are Never Getting Back Together\u201d \u2014 at the Grammys, by singing the hit in an English accent.  The Scottish DJ and Singer sparked dating rumors after being photographed together in Whole Foods wearing color-coordinated outfits in March of 2015.  They then made things official by attending the Billboard Music Awards together in May where they got some PDA in for the cameras. The couple dated for over a year, yet in March of 2016, Harris called things off in what pals described as a \u201cbrutal\u201d split.  Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston met \u2014 and danced together \u2014 at the Met Gala in 2016.  Just one month later, pictures surfaced of the two kissing at the beach in Rhode Island, solidifying their relationship. The couple, known as \u201cHiddleswift\u201d caught everyone by surprise \u2014 including Swift.  It\u2019s rumored she wrote the song \u201cGetaway Car\u201d about how bad she felt about getting into a new relationship so soon after her breakup with Harris.  Either way, the couple called it quits just a few months later.  Fast forward all the way to 2017 and Taylor found herself in her longest \u2014 and most secretive \u2014 relationship yet.  Even after dating for over 4 years, the English actor and pop star rarely make public appearances hand in hand. In fact, they still have yet to walk a red carpet together. But Swift has never been happier.  \u201cI was falling in love with someone who had a wonderfully normal, balanced life,\u201d she said in her 2020 autobiographical documentary \u201cMiss Americana.\u201d  \u201cWe decided together we wanted our relationship to be private. I was happy. But I wasn\u2019t happy in the way I was trained to be happy. It was happiness without anyone else\u2019s input. We were just happy.\u201d The happy couple seems to bond over music \u2014 and cats. Joe co-wrote multiple songs on Taylor\u2019s albums \u201cEvermore\u201d and \u201cFolklore\u201d under the pseudonym William Bowery, while the couple spent their COVID-19 lockdown together with their three cats: Meredith, Benjamin and Olivia.  \nRead Next\n \n\n\t\t\t\tFans think Selena Gomez's sweater hints at Chris Evans con...\t\t\t\n \n\n \nThis story has been shared 80,638 times.\n80,638\n \nThis story has been shared 52,721 times.\n52,721\n \nThis story has been shared 28,238 times.\n28,238\n \nThis story has been shared 19,034 times.\n19,034\n Follow us \n\u00a9 2022 NYP Holdings, Inc.

The post featured a montage of photos of Gomez throughout her on-again, off-again relationship with Bieber in the 2010s with the caption, \u201cThe reason why Selena is always skinny when she dates Justin.\u201d The video ended with a screenshot of a 2014 Instagram comment in which Gomez wrote that she was \u201ctoo normal\u201d for Bieber, who would \u201crather\u201d date \u201cmodels.\u201d The \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d star, 30, took to the comments section of the TikTok on Sunday to react with a sad-face emoji, leading many users to wonder what message she was trying to convey. Several fans called out TikToker @donttellmymomma.fr, who posted the video, for criticizing Gomez, while others suggested the \u201cSame Old Love\u201d singer was admitting Bieber, 28, had body-shamed her when they were a couple. \u201cyou\u2019re very ill. how can you not see that you\u2019re hurting the one that you claim to be a fan of by still making videos like this more than half a decade later,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cmaybe she\u2019s upset you guys are constantly bringing up her body changing over the years. she has a right to react to her OWN life. either way she\u2019s \ud83d\udd25,\u201d a second person chimed in. Gomez dated Bieber on and off from 2010 to 2018. After their final breakup, the \u201cPeaches\u201d singer quickly got engaged to Hailey Bieber (n\u00e9e Baldwin). Hailey\u2019s whirlwind relationship with Justin spurred many fans to call into question the timeline, with some even accusing him of cheating with her while still dating Gomez. But after years of rampant rumors of a feud between Gomez and Hailey, the Rhode Skin founder cleared the air on where she stands with the \u201cLove You Like a Love Song\u201d singer. \u201cIt\u2019s all respect. It\u2019s all love,\u201d the model, 26, said on the\u00a0\u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast\u00a0in September, sharing that she and Gomez have talked in recent years. Hailey added that there was \u201cno drama personally\u201d between her and Gomez. \u201cNeither of us owe anybody anything except respect. I respect her a lot, and I think there are no expectations [between us]. I respect her,\u201d she said. Hailey did, however, play coy about the rumors that she stole Justin from Gomez, saying on the podcast, \u201cA lot of the perpetuation and the hate comes from \u2018Oh, you stole him.\u2019 It\u2019s about people knowing the truth. Because there\u2019s a truth.\u201d Advertisement Gomez and Hailey buried the beef rumors once and for all in October when they hugged it out at a star-studded gala. The \u201cWizards of Waverly Place\u201d alum brushed off the viral moment weeks later, saying it was \u201cnot even a thing\u201d and \u201cnot a big deal.\u201d Justin and Hailey\u00a0quietly tied the knot at a courthouse\u00a0in September 2018 and\u00a0wed again in front of their loved ones\u00a0the following year. Gomez, for her part, appears to be single, as she recently poked fun at her current dating life, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take anyone.\u201d \nRead Next\n \n\n\t\t\t\tBam Margera celebrates hospital release after pneumonia ba...\t\t\t\n \n\n \nThis story has been shared 80,638 times.\n80,638\n \nThis story has been shared 52,721 times.\n52,721\n \nThis story has been shared 28,238 times.\n28,238\n \nThis story has been shared 19,034 times.\n19,034\n Follow us \n\u00a9 2022 NYP Holdings, Inc.

In other words, this is a story about a Taylor Swift song. It is also a story about how the police should assign a security detail to Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s mansion and flank the actor should he step out for a Starbucks in a red scarf. As I\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s Taylor Swift\u2019s world and we are just living in it. Her army of fans, the Swifties, is a cult made up of Sherlock Holmes and Miss Marple wannabes that sift through her prodigious artistry to look for clues as to who has wronged Dear Leader. T-Swizzle has elevated the breakup song into a rallying cry for vengeance. Her latest, a 10-minute recording of 2012 hit \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d arrived the other day. It was soon accompanied by a 14-minute film, written and directed by Swift, starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O\u2019Brien. As films go, this was no \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d But, somewhere, Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s publicist was suddenly in the downdraft, fielding 50 calls per hour from the media, including queries such as, \u201cDoes Jake have any comment on Taylor\u2019s new video?\u201d and \u201cDoes Jakey-Jake regret dating Tay-Tay?\u201d This doomed romance reportedly unspooled in late 2010. The two were a couple for three months. I have a squeeze bottle of mustard in my fridge that has lasted longer. No matter. \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d from Taylor\u2019s \u201cRed\u201d album, was like Stonehenge to the Swifties. They scrutinized lyrics, connected dots, found Easter eggs, triangulated dates and places, and concluded the cad who wronged Dear Leader was Gyllenhaal, a rumour that has animated the Swiftieverse since the first iPad was released. The remade \u201cAll Too Well\u201d has only splashed kerosene on this gossip fire. New lyrics include: \u201cYou, who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes / Sipping coffee like you were on a late night show / But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come / And he said, \u2018It\u2019s supposed to be fun \u2026 turning 21.\u2019\u201d And: \u201cI was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes / \u2018I\u2019ll get older, but your lovers stay my age.\u2019\u201d All righty. I watched the new video and short film with an open mind. I really wanted to understand why, as Slate put it this week, \u201cTaylor Swift Fans Seem Ready to Commit Homicide on Jake Gyllenhaal.\u201d But I don\u2019t get this anti-Jake hate. If this song is really about him \u2014 and Taylor has never confirmed it is \u2014 what exactly did he do that\u2019s so worthy of Swiftian scorn? Based on the film and video, he didn\u2019t cheat on her. He was not abusive. He did not cover his ears as she was demoing an experimental track, even though that would be perfectly reasonable. The biggest problem unfolds at a dinner table, when she tries to hold his hand, but he\u2019s too busy gabbing with friends. This leads to a squabble in the kitchen, as she scrubs dishes and acts like this aborted hand-holding incident was tantamount to first degree murder. Was she 21 at the time or 12? Apparently, Gyllenhaal \u2014 if this silly song is about him \u2014 also still has a red scarf Taylor left at his sister\u2019s house. That would be Maggie Gyllenhaal, who addressed this conspiracy with Andy Cohen four years ago: \u201cYou know, I never understood why everybody asked me about this scarf. What is this? I am in the dark about the scarf.\u201d Me too, Maggie. But the whereabouts of this knitted fashion accessory has taken on a life of its own this week. The legendary Dionne Warwick tweeted this on Monday: \u201cIf that young man has Taylor\u2019s scarf he should return it \u2026 It does not belong to you. Box it up and I will pay the cost of postage, Jake.\u201d Ms. Warwick, will you pay the shipping and handling if I buy a new brain? The one I have right now can\u2019t take much more of this. You know who I feel really sorry for in this ridiculous relitigation of Jake Gyllenhaal? Joe Alwyn, Taylor\u2019s current boyfriend. That poor bastard must be tiptoeing through life on tenterhooks. Imagine being in a relationship and knowing, deep in your heart, that if things go sideways you will be shamed and cyberbullied due to a future pop song. I don\u2019t want any trouble with the Swifties. But there is something seriously wrong with Dear Leader. If I were a conspiracist, I might conclude Swift has deliberately got into bad relationships just so she had breakup material for future albums. Forget an NDA, Joe. You need an NSA \u2014 \u201cNo Song Agreement.\u201d In the short film and video, Taylor Swift comes across as a needy and insecure maniac who can\u2019t bridge reality and fantasy. That\u2019s why Jake Gyllenhaal should be thanking God he escaped, even if he\u2019s now Public Enemy No. 1 in the Swiftieverse.  He inherited a scarf and dodged a bullet.

Reading this during the day? Then you've caught me testing gear and editing reviews of laptops, desktop PCs, and tons of other personal tech. (Reading this at night? Then I\u2019m probably dreaming about all those cool products.) I\u2019ve covered the consumer tech world as an editor, reporter, and analyst since 2015. AMD's Ryzen 5 3400G is an inexpensive AM4-socket CPU with a potent integrated graphics processor, making it an excellent choice for a multipurpose entry-level PC build. \n\n\nAMD shorthand lesson: The \"G\" is for \"graphics.\" AMD's quad-core Ryzen 5 3400G is one of just a few of the company's Ryzen-branded CPUs that include built-in graphics processing. It's particularly suited for installation in a PC that doesn't need a discrete GPU for graphics-intensive activities such as editing video or playing 3D games. A list price of just $149 and competent computing performance make it a fine value, too. Whether you're building a budget productivity PC or a very entry-level gaming rig without a video card, the Ryzen 5 3400G is an excellent choice to power it.  The Ryzen 5 3400G is from AMD's latest third-generation Ryzen CPU family, but it's a bit different than most of the pack. Most of the third-generation chips use an entirely new 7-nanometer (nm) processor architecture (dubbed \"Zen 2\") and offer significant improvements over their predecessors. The Ryzen 5 3400G does not. Rather, it's an updated version of the second-generation Ryzen 5 2400G, sharing many of the same features and a similar microarchitecture. It also generally matches\u2014and in some cases slightly exceeds\u2014the second-generation chip's proficient computing performance. Part of this proficiency stems from its support for multithreading. Of the third-generation Ryzen CPUs that have built-in graphics processing (a family of two, at this writing), the Ryzen 5 3400G is the only one of the pair to boast this feature. Here's a cheat sheet of all the new-for-2019 desktop Ryzens...  Multithreading can boost performance when running modern CPU-intensive applications like software that transcodes video or renders 3D imagery. Each of the Ryzen 5 3400G's cores can handle two processing threads, compared with just one thread per core for the entry-level AMD Ryzen 3 3200G, which also has four physical cores. A full review of the Ryzen 3 3200G is forthcoming, but you can see how it stacks up against the Ryzen 5 3400G in the performance section of this review.  The Ryzen 5 3400G's $50 premium over the $99 Ryzen 3 3200G also gets you slightly higher clock speeds. The Ryzen 5 3400G runs at a base clock of 3.7GHz, versus 3.6GHz for the Ryzen 3 3200G. The more expensive chip also offers a maximum boost clock speed of 4.2GHz, compared with 4GHz for its Ryzen 3 sibling. Although these rated speed differences might seem small, the difference between the maximum boost clocks, in particular, could be a significant time saver when you're compressing files or touching up photos. The final major difference between the two chips pertains to their graphics processing. The Ryzen 5 3400G comes with a built-in AMD Radeon RX Vega 11 GPU, with 11 graphics cores of its own running at up to a 1,400MHz clock speed. The RX Vega 11 is a step above the RX Vega 8 that's on the Ryzen 3 3200G, which has eight graphics cores and a 1,250MHz peak. Both are well ahead of the performance you can expect from Intel's integrated graphics solutions, such as the UHD Graphics 630 found in most of its recent mainstream desktop CPUs. Don't be misled by the \"Vega\" nomenclature, though, which is shared with AMD's previous generation of high-end discrete graphics cards (for example, the AMD Radeon RX Vega 64). The RX Vega 11 and RX Vega 8, while robust for what they are, don't offer anywhere near the full graphics horsepower that you'd get from AMD's standalone Radeon RX graphics cards or their Nvidia GeForce GTX or RTX competitors.  The Ryzen 5 3400G and Ryzen 3 2400G share most of the rest of their specs. Both have a rated power consumption (referred to as thermal design power, or TDP) of 65 watts. Since the CPU and GPU typically take up the lion's share of a PC's power consumption, the Ryzen 5 3400G's reasonable power draw means you don't need to spring for a high-wattage power supply, especially since you presumably bought it to avoid the need for a dedicated video card. Both chips offer a similar cache amount\u20146MB of combined L2 and L3 cache\u2014and support for a maximum memory speed of 2,933MHz. The cache size and memory speed can have a significant impact on memory-intensive tasks. If the cache fills up, apps that you're running might feel sluggish, and tasks will take longer to complete. Although a 6MB cache might seem small, it's actually fairly common among inexpensive CPUs. Those that cost several hundred dollars have much larger caches; most of AMD's other third-gen Ryzen chips have combined cache sizes above 35MB. Finally, both the Ryzen 5 3400G and the Ryzen 3 3200G share the same processor microarchitecture, based on a 12nm production process. This is not AMD's cutting-edge 7nm Zen 2 microarchitecture, but it's a slight improvement over the 14nm process that AMD used for the second-generation Ryzen G-series CPUs. A smaller, more advanced microarchitecture isn't by itself a reason to choose a CPU, but it can have an impact on performance.  Intel has several competitors to the Ryzen 5 3400G, but the closest alternative is the \"Coffee Lake\"-family Intel Core i5-9400. It's set up a bit differently than AMD's offering, with a slightly higher list price ($182), a slightly larger cache (9MB), and more physical computing cores (six). The Core i5-9400 lacks support for multithreading, however (called Hyper-Threading, in Intel's lingo), so it can handle only up to six processing threads simultaneously, versus eight for the Ryzen 5 3400G. The two chips share the same 65-watt TDP, but the Core i5-9400 has a 2.9GHz base clock speed and a 4.2GHz boost clock, both lower than those of the Ryzen 5 3400G. Another key difference is the Core i5-9400's graphics processing. Its built-in Intel UHD Graphics 630 simply isn't in the same league as the RX Vega 11, as you'll see in our graphics testing below. AMD includes an able, attractive cooling fan in the retail box with its third-generation CPUs, including the Ryzen 5 3400G. Higher-end Ryzen chips get higher-end versions of the fan, all of which are branded as AMD Wraith coolers. The top Wraiths are bigger than this one, and have nifty RGB ring lighting. Intel generally includes a stock fan, too (except with its unlocked \"K\" processors and the high-end Core X-Series chips), and neither this chip nor its Intel Core i5 counterpart requires overly advanced cooling capabilities. The stock fan will suffice, and in the case of the AMD, it's a nifty-looking design, too, in the event you're building or upgrading a PC that has a transparent side.  For people building an entry-level PC from scratch, the motherboard shouldn't be a significant cost factor, either. The Ryzen 5 3400G is compatible with most AM4-socket motherboards, though earlier-gen models may require a BIOS update; make sure what board you're buying is ready for third-generation Ryzen out of the box. (The only new-chipset boards that debuted alongside third-generation Ryzen, based on the enthusiast-minded AMD X570 chipset, are pricier models that would seem a poor fit for a budget chip like the Ryzen 5 3400G.) The Intel Core i5-9400, in contrast, is compatible with certain LGA 1151-socket montherboards, but these boards need to be built on one of Intel's more recent 300-series chipsets, among them the Z370, Q370, B360, or H310. (You'll also find LGA 1151 boards with older 100- and 200-series chipsets still on the market, but they won't work with these \"Coffee Lake\" desktop chips.) AMD or Intel, you're sure to find an inexpensive board for either chip. AMD also offers robust tuning software in the form of the free Ryzen Master app, which affords granular control over clock speeds, memory profiles, and even overclocking. You can't overclock the Core i5-9400, but overclocking is not a critical feature on budget-minded CPUs like these, since it's unlikely to meaningfully boost performance. Plus, the cooling hardware you ought to install to overclock will eat up more than the difference between the CPU and a slightly better one.  I compared the Ryzen 5 3400G's CPU performance on our benchmark tests with its little sibling, the $99 Ryzen 3 3200G, as well as the previous-generation Ryzen 5 2400G and the Intel Core i5-8400. PC Labs hasn't had the opportunity to test a 9th Generation Core i3 or i5 CPU yet, but other than an increased base clock speed of 2.9GHz, the new Core i5-9400 is much like its predecessor, including its $180 price and six-core/six-thread design. As PC Labs hasn't tested one yet, I'm using the Core i5-8400 as a point of comparison for this review. Also in the comparison charts below, you'll find performance stats for two less-expensive Intel processors (the $80-to-$90 Celeron G4920 and the $100 Pentium Gold G5600, which we're also in the process of reviewing), as well as the more expensive and far more capable AMD Ryzen 5 3600(Opens in a new window), another third-gen Ryzen chip that PC Labs has tested for review. That one, though, like the rest of the Ryzen desktop CPUs that don't end in \"G,\" lacks built-in graphics processing and devotes the whole die to CPU affairs. Overall, the Ryzen 5 3400G performed as expected on most tests. That is to say, it offered roughly equivalent performance to the Intel Core i5-8400, slightly better performance than the Ryzen 3 3200G, and much better performance than both the Celeron G4920 and the Pentium Gold G5600. Note that we tested all of the G series chips on a B350 motherboard, the Gigabyte AB350-Gaming 3(Opens in a new window), with 16GB of Corsair memory set to the only offered XMP profile of 3,000MHz, a bit above the 3400G's rated 2,933MHz supported max. Maxon's CPU-crunching Cinebench R15 test, which is fully threaded to make use of all available processor cores and threads, shows that the Intel Core i5-8400 does have a slight advantage because of its two extra physical cores, despite the Ryzen 5 3400G's edge in total addressable threads. The advantage holds both on the single-core test and the all-cores test. (The Ryzen 5 3600, with six cores but 12 addressable threads, dominated the field here, as it should.)  It's worth noting that the single-core test is a decent proxy for how well a CPU can handle older software that doesn't scale well with more cores and threads. (More on that later with our iTunes legacy test.) The Core i5-8400's slight advantage is also evident on the Handbrake video-encoding test, a trial that took the Ryzen 5 3400G a bit more than two minutes longer to complete. Still, both of these results are better than the cheaper Ryzen 3 3200G's time, and vast improvements over the 40-plus minutes that the light-hitting Celeron G4920 took.  The Cinebench and Handbrake tests also establish the superiority of the Ryzen 5 3600, but the Blender test, which simulates a workflow in the popular open-source 3D rendering suite, challenges it. Here, the Core i5-8400 actually performed the best of them all.  Still, you should invest in a more expensive Core i7 or Ryzen 7 CPU if you're planning on running powerful creative software like Blender or POV-Ray. On the all-cores benchmark built into the POV-Ray ray-tracing software, the Ryzen 5 3400G placed neatly between the step-down Ryzen 3 3200G and the Core i5-8400.  On the other hand, creating ZIP files is something that nearly every PC user has to do at some point, and it's CPU-intensive. We simulate this process with the benchmark tool built into the 7-Zip utility. Here, the Ryzen 5 3400G offered a significant advantage over its predecessor and the Ryzen 3 3200G, and a small advantage over the Core i5-8400.  Finally, if you do find yourself needing to perform a CPU-intensive task with older software that can only run on a single thread, you'll note that the Ryzen G-series CPUs compared here performed roughly the same in our test scenario, with the Intel Core i5-8400 and AMD Ryzen 5 3600 slightly ahead of that pack and equal.    Although the Ryzen 5 3400G, the Ryzen 3 3200G, and the Core i5-8400 offer comparable performance on CPU-intensive benchmarks, the graphics processors in the Ryzen G-series chips tell a whole other story. The RX Vega 11 and even the RX Vega 8 outclass their Intel counterparts when it comes to playing 3D-heavy games. On all four of the games we tested, the RX Vega 11 far outran the Intel UHD Graphics 630 in the $99 Pentium G5600. We don't have integrated graphics game-performance numbers for the Core i5-8400, but we'd expect numbers a bit better than the Pentium chip's, but not by leaps and bounds, as they both use the same UHD Graphics 630 silicon. Even if it were to run twice as well, in almost all cases it still wouldn't touch the RX Vega 11.  The Ryzen 5 3400G far outperformed the other CPUs on the 3DMark Night Raid game simulation. Looking at the graphics subscore on this test, it's also clear that you should expect roughly a 25 percent 3D graphics performance improvement if you choose the Ryzen 5 3400G over the Ryzen 3 3200G.  The Ryzen 5 3400G is among today's best values for an entry-level CPU that will stand alone in a PC build or upgrade, without a discrete GPU. (You can always pair it with one, but if you plan to, you're better off opting for a chip like an earlier-generation Ryzen 5 without discrete graphics.) Its price, features, and performance on CPU-intensive tasks are roughly comparable with the Intel competition, and its graphics performance is better. The same can be said of the Ryzen 3 3200G, but you're giving up a bit of performance across the board by choosing it in return for saving just $50. Since the CPU is arguably the most important component in any PC build, we recommend investing the extra cash and springing for the Ryzen 5 3400G.  The calculus changes significantly if you can find any of these chips on sale, though. (Previous-gen Ryzen CPUs are seeing some steep discounts at this writing.) It's also a different game if you are looking for an upgrade to an existing Ryzen- or Intel Core-based system. In the latter case, compatibility with existing components becomes much more important. So long as you're on an AM4 motherboard, this chip ought to be compatible if the board maker has issued a BIOS update supporting the third-gen Ryzens. Overall, however, the Ryzen 5 3400G takes the undisputed title of king of entry-level PC builds away from its predecessor, and earns our Editors' Choice award. AMD's Ryzen 5 3400G is an inexpensive AM4-socket CPU with a potent integrated graphics processor, making it an excellent choice for a multipurpose entry-level PC build.

Primarily, I will be\ngoing over the system interface types, rather than the actual disk types. This series will\nbe broken into three parts. For this article, I will present technologies based\non the ATA/SATA standard. The second part will go over the SATA II and SCSI\nstandards, while the last part will discuss fibre channel disks and provide a\nsummary and comparison chart of the various connections. Parallel ATA /IDE (Integrated Device Electronics)/EIDE (Enhanced IDE)  Parallel ATA\nis a parallel interface with each channel supporting a maximum of two devices\nand a cable length of 0.5 meters. While the two-device limit per channel in and\nof itself is not that serious, the parallel nature of the interface reduces its\nperformance since only one device at a time can communicate on the channel.\nFurther, current ATA/IDE drives do not support transfer speeds of above 80 MBps\nor so, a figure which is purely theoretical under perfect circumstances.\nMoreover, the overall design of parallel ATA inhibits real-world performance\ngains beyond 100 MBps, meaning that the standard would need to evolve before\nmaking this leap. Some Parallel ATA drawbacks The Parallel\nATA interface also suffers from some other problems. First, the sheer size of\nthe cable, containing either 40 or 80 wires, makes installing a number of\ndevices difficult. And, some parallel ATA cables are not keyed, meaning that\nthey can accidentally be inserted upside down. The parallel ATA interface also\nuses high 5V signaling, which runs counter to manufacturer's efforts to lower\noverall system voltage requirements for cooler systems. Lastly, while recent\nversions of the ATA standard do include CRC checks on the data, ATA command\ndata remains unchecked and is a potential source of errors, making it\nunsuitable for high-end storage needs. Both parallel\nATA and serial ATA suffer from operating system-induced capacity limitations.\nFor those running versions of Windows prior to Windows 2000 SP3, your operating\nsystem (and drivers) imposes a 28-bit logical block address (LBA), meaning that\nthe largest drive supported is 137 GB. Later versions of Windows support a\n48-bit LBA and, thus, can use drives up to 144 petabytes in size. Parallel ATA\ndrives are mostly relegated to non-server scenarios, including both laptops and\ndesktops, but even in these applications parallel ATA is giving way to the more\nefficient Serial ATA mechanism. SATA (Serial ATA)--also known as SATA I The SATA\nspecification is designed in such a way that it is software compatible with\nparallel ATA, so all operating systems that support parallel ATA should have no\nproblem supporting SATA disk...as long as you have a SATA controller card and\ncables, of course. While many\nSATA implementations are point-to-point affairs, add-on SATA specs also allow\nfor a port multiplier that increases the number of devices supported on a\nsingle channel from one to fifteen, utilizing the full bandwidth of the main\nconnection to the host. However, fifteen disks would likely result in serious\nperformance issues since the host connections in SATA run at speeds of only 150\nMBps peak. An average disk provides about a 50-MBps transfer rate, meaning that\na SATA port peaks at three disks. While all SATA controllers are supposed to\nsupport port multipliers to some degree, note that not all SATA I controllers\nhave the features that enable port multipliers to be used in a\nperformance-enhancing fashion. On the\nvoltage front, SATA has a reduced signaling voltage requirement of 500mV, down\nfrom parallel ATA's 5V requirement. SATA also supports the ability to hot-plug\nnew devices, which was not possible with parallel ATA. Overall, SATA\nI satisfies many of the problems associated with parallel ATA, but even with a slight\nincrease in its theoretical speed (up to 150 MBps from parallel ATA's maximum\ntheoretical speed of 133 MBps), lower signaling voltage, and cables that about\na million times better, SATA I is still very much rooted in ATA-land and lacks\nmany of the advanced features required for high-end storage. SATA II,\nstarting to seriously hit the market now, improves on SATA I. The specification\ncalls for improvements that make it more enterprise-ready, including support\nfor higher speeds, native command queuing, and more. I will provide an overview\nof SATA II in my next article."], "https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Want-to-add-ssd-in-hp-15-ec0101ax/td-p/7671721": [" \n\n\u200e07-04-2020\n12:32 AM\n\n I wanna know if I can addd a ssd in hp pavilion 15-ec0101ax\u00a0 .

Ed Sheeran's newest song, 'Celestial,' has been confirmed to be featured in the upcoming Pokemon Scarlet and Violet video games. A music video for the song also released, showing Ed Sheeran spend time with iconic Pokemon and battle Mewtwo. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, the highly anticipated Gen 9 Pokemon games, are coming out in just a couple of months. As fans wait for the upcoming titles to release, they were surprised to find out that Ed Sheeran has made a song that will be in the games, as well as a music video that shows him interacting with beloved Pokemon from previous generations. RELATED: Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Give Official Introduction to Wiglett The music video for 'Celestial' begins with a Pikachu trying to wake Ed Sheeran up, electrocuting him when nothing else seems to work. Shortly after, as Ed Sheeran prepares his breakfast, a Charmander burns it, accidentally causing a small fire that a Squirtle puts out. Ed Sheeran then eats his breakfast with Pikachu, Charmander, Squirtle, and Slowpoke. Shortly after leaving his house, Ed Sheeran almost gets hit by a car, only for a Snorlax to come to his rescue, sending him and the car into the sky. While Machamp catches the car, Ed Sheeran soars over to a Lapras, who gives him a ride to a field where a group of Bulbasaur and an Eevee can be spotted. When he leaves, a Charizard flies over to Ed Sheeran, picks him up, and brings him back home, where he plays music as the Pokemon he ate breakfast with, as well as Mew, dance. A television then turns on to show what Ed Sheeran would look like in the Pokemon anime. Fighting against Mewtwo, Ed Sheeran releases the Gen 8 starter Pokemon from their Pokeballs. The three of them, along with the other Pokemon that were seen throughout the video, help each other in the battle with Mewtwo. However, before the winner of the battle is determined, the video is revealed to have all been a dream that Ed Sheeran had as Pikachu watches him sleep. The video ends with Pikachu going inside of Ed Sheeran's Game Boy Color as he wakes up once more. He picks up the Game Boy Color, only to fall back asleep as Hypno makes him feel tired. Ed Sheeran commented on the music video that Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players will be able to find the song in the game. A lot of fans enjoyed the video and expressed in the comments how much they look forward to hearing the song in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will come out on November 18 for the Nintendo Switch.

This is significant because, with Wi-Fi 6E, your Wi-Fi network gets fourteen channels of 80MHz and seven channels of 160MHz. How is this beneficial for you? Firstly, the use of these channels means there is far less interference from nearby Wi-Fi devices. Hence, you get uninterrupted Wi-Fi signals to stream Netflix and play all the online games you want. Next, the opening of the 6GHz band allows for a significantly higher data transfer rate. Thanks to broader channels, Wi-Fi 6E enables devices to transmit and receive larger signals. Thus, Wi-Fi 6E can offer speeds of up to 9.6Gbps. Of course, this is only in theory, and you cannot expect anything more than 2.4Gbps to be available. Further, Wi-Fi 6E gets you a low latency network. We have all noticed latency-related issues while playing games online or during a video call with the office. Wi-Fi 6E offers low latency that is ideal for gaming, video calls, and any application that requires constant two-way communications. Finally, manufacturers are constantly introducing smart home devices. These devices need a good Wi-Fi network. Additionally, network connections have to work simultaneously so that each device can function independently. Wi-Fi 6E uses technologies like MU-MIMO and OFDMA (explained later) to facilitate this need. Hence, you must consider Wi-Fi 6E if you want to benefit from these capabilities. This article will compare and review the Best Wi-Fi 6E PCIe cards that you can install on your desktop PCs. Next, we will discuss the key considerations you must keep in mind when buying a Wi-Fi 6E PCIe card. Finally, we will address some frequently asked questions related to this technology and such cards. Intel specifications for Wi-Fi 6E are detailed under their AX210 standard. This standard is used to bring Wi-Fi 6E capabilities to your computer. These include the opening of 1200MHz of spectrum in the 6GHz band. As a result, you get close to 21 new high-frequency channels over and above the previous versions of Wi-Fi. Ubit uses the Intel AX210 standard to offer Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. Consequently, the card gives you the triband frequencies of 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz. The 2.4GHz allows data transfers at 574Mbps, while the 5GHz/6GHz allows for 2400Mbps. You also get Bluetooth 5.2. This allows you to faster Bluetooth data transfer rates on 2 Mbps and offers features like Dual Audio. Dual Audio enables you to connect to two Bluetooth 5.2 devices simultaneously. Additionally, you can pair game controllers, keyboards, and other Bluetooth devices all at once. The Ubit Wi-Fi 6E card uses the PCIe interface slot. It comes with the antennae and the heat sink attached. Hence, you have to find a vacant slot on the motherboard and plug in the device. Unfortunately, because the antennae are attached to the card, you cannot place them to ensure better reception. You can install this Wi-Fi 6E card from Ubit on any computer running on Windows, Linux, or Chrome OS. However, be sure to download the device drivers from Intel\u2019s website before you start the installation. The Gigabyte GC-WBAX210 card offers the Intel AX210 standard for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. Among the obvious benefits of greater speed and low latency, you also get the use of MU-MIMO technology. MU-MIMO or Multi-User Multi-Input Multi-Output technology allows multiple Wi-Fi-enabled devices to communicate with a router simultaneously. Without it, your computer would have to wait for the router that may be busy serving several other devices. With MU-MIMO, it can continuously communicate on a one-to-one basis with the router. Thus, resulting in a faster and more responsive Wi-Fi connection. Of course, this automatically means that your router must also feature this technology. This card from Gigabyte comes with the AORUS high-performance 2Tx2R antenna. Thankfully, the antenna comes with an extension cable. It allows you to place the antenna at a convenient location. Cards with attached antennas tend to suffer from poor signal strength due to their fixed nature. The Gigabyte GC-WBAX210 uses the PCIe interface to connect to the motherboard. Gigabyte offers the card\u2019s compatibility with Windows and remains silent concerning other operating systems. Nonetheless, it is an excellent option if you are looking to upgrade your Wi-Fi setup. You get the triband frequency that supports data speeds up to 2400Mbps. Further, you also get an interference-free environment that ensures your video stream without buffering delays. The Wi-Fi 6E card from Cudy is a user\u2019s delight. When you buy the card, you also get all the supporting collaterals along with it. This includes a quick installation guide and a CD that contains the device drivers. Apart from that, you also get a low-profile bracket, two antennae, and a Bluetooth header cable. It shows Cudy has put some thought into their packaging. They seem to have made an effort to ensure you do not face a problem with the installation. This card offers you the standards that come with the AX210 card. You get triband Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, MU-MIMO, OFDMA. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is a technology that allows multiple devices to access the same Wi-Fi frequency signal. It does this by dividing the frequency into something called Resource Units (RU). Once this is done, it simply assigns an RU to each device. As a result, it can divide a signal over multiple users within a Wi-Fi network. Cudy sends you the Wi-Fi 6E card and the CD containing the drivers. While thoughtful, most users would not have a CD drive to run the disc on their computer. Therefore, you must ensure that before doing anything else, you download the drivers. This will save you a whole lot of hassle later. Like the card from Cudy before this, the Xiaolo makes the installation process easy for the users. In fact, this card from Xiaolo goes one better. How? It includes the screws and a small screwdriver to ensure you have everything you need for the installation. Of course, you also all get the essentials; the antennae, installation guide, driver CD, low-profile bracket, and a header cable. The card used the PCIe interface slot and can be used with PCIe x1, x4, x8, and x16 pin interfaces. The Bluetooth connection needs to be powered by a 9-pin header on the motherboard, without which Bluetooth will not work. You get the usual AX210 standard specifications for Wi-Fi 6E. This includes the higher data transfer rates and connection to as many Bluetooth devices as you like. The device comes with an Aluminum Thermal Conductive sheet. This acts as a heat sink and helps a great deal to dissipate the heat. Also, it enhances the life of the device by protecting it from the damage caused by excessive temperatures. No products found. The Wi-Fi 6E card offered by Saber-Toothed Tiger uses the Intel AX210 standard. Hence, you get triband frequencies for your Wi-Fi network. This includes data speeds of 574Mbps on the 2.4GHz frequency and 2400Mbps on the 5GHz/6GHz frequencies. Additionally, you get Bluetooth 5.2, which gets you ultra-low latency and lower power consumption. Along with this, you also get to connect multiple devices simultaneously. Data speed can reach a maximum of 48Mbps and can cover a wide area with a 300-meter radius. The card uses Aluminum alloy heat sinks. This is very effective in the heat dissipation process. With better heat management, your Wi-Fi 6E card will be able to perform well for a prolonged period of time. The device uses the PCIe interface slot to connect to the motherboard. To suit your convenience, you can use PCIe x1, x4, x8, or x16 interfaces. It is compatible with Windows and Linus operating systems only. Saber-Toothed Tiger does not package a driver\u2019s CD along with the card. Hence, be sure to download the drivers before you embark upon the installation process. The Fenvi AXE3000Pro offers some advantages over similar cards offered by other vendors. The main benefit that this card provides relates to antennae placement. Most other vendors attach the antenna to the card directly. Desktop PCs are not mobile. Hence, once you have set up your workstation, there is little chance of you moving the setup around. If you use an ethernet cable to connect to the internet, this will not be a problem. However, if you use Wi-Fi, the primary consideration would be whether the desktop can receive the signal without any hindrance. This is where an antenna\u2019s location plays a vital role. With this card from Fenvi, you are not restricted to leaving it attached to the card. Fenvi uses an extension cable that allows you to place the antenna to receive the best reception. The Fenvi AXE3000Pro uses the AX210 standard. It gives you triband Wi-Fi with 573M[email\u00a0protected] and [email\u00a0protected]/6GHz. Additionally, there is Bluetooth 5.2, and for multi-user environments, there is MU-MIMO and OFDMA on offer. The AXE3000Pro uses the PCIe interface slot to connect to the motherboard. It comes with a heat sink to protect your device from damages caused by heating. Edup offers you this Wi-Fi 6E card that conforms to the AX210 standard set by Intel. This means you get the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz frequencies. The 2.4GHz frequency offers you 574Mbps data speed. However, if you need some more, then the 5GHz and 6GHz give you 2400Mbps. This is ideal for streaming content from Netflix or playing your favorite online games. It conforms to the IEEE 802.11as standard and is backward compatible with all previous standards. Additionally, Bluetooth v5.2 allows you a significant advantage over the previous version. You now get 48Mbps data transfer speed, and you can connect multiple devices to your computer. The card also uses technologies like MU-MIMO and OFDMA to keep you connected in multi-user environments. This card from Edup comes with the essentials kit that also includes an instruction manual and the driver\u2019s CD. Unfortunately, it does not provide a way to position the antenna. Hence, you need to ensure you get adequate network coverage where your desktop is kept. The Edup card disappoints again as it is not compatible with non-Windows-based platforms. Edup remains silent on the material it uses for its heat sink. However, it has a heat sink that manages the heat dissipation should be good enough to consider buying it. This Wi-Fi 6E card from OKN gives you triband frequencies and Bluetooth 5.2. It conforms to the AX210 standard. Hence, you get all the associated features like MU-MINO and OFDMA as well. Thus, you can get speeds of up to 2400Mbps that would allow you to stream online videos without a problem. Further, your connection will not experience lag or interference with multiple users in the same network. Therefore, you can experience better video calls, responsive gaming, or immersive VR experiences. The card is compatible with Windows and Linux operating systems only. It uses the PCIe interface and is compatible with all variations. The card comes with an installation manual and user guide. However, OKN gives the drivers a miss. Hence, be sure to download the drivers before you uninstall your current Wi-Fi card. There are plenty of Wi-Fi 6E PCIe cards that are available in the market. However, they all conform to the Intel AX210 Standard. This means that they all offer the same set of features that include Triband Frequencies, Bluetooth 5.2, and MU-MIMO/OFDMA Hence, the only consideration you need to make are: Cards like the Ubit are compatible with Windows, Linux, and Chrome OS. This is rare to see, making it among the very few. Most other cards will only be compatible with Windows, while some might add Linux. But, cards compatible with Chrome OS is quite rare. Installing a Wi-Fi 6E card can be challenging if you have never done hardware installation before. Hence, you must look for a card that offers you step-by-step instruction. For this, we recommend the cards from Cudy, Xiaolo, and Saber-Toothed Tiger. You must look for a vendor that offers you the drivers on a CD. If not, they must explicitly tell you to download the driver before starting installation. You do not want to start installing the card only to realize the drivers need to be downloaded. That would mean backtracking and starting from the top. The cards offered by Fenvi and Edup are an excellent option. Since you cannot move desktops around, you need an antenna that you can adjust to enhance signal reception. Hence, the cards offered by Gigabyte and Fenvi hold significant advantages. Remember, these cards pretty much offer you the same set of features. Hence, you can rest assured you will get all the functionality of the AX210 standard. Intel sets the AX210 standard for Wi-Fi 6E cards. The AX210 itself conforms to the IEEE 802.11 standard that opens the 6GHz band for Wi-Fi use. Hence, users get the benefits of 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz. These deliver faster data speeds, low latency, and minimal interference in Wi-Fi networks. Wi-Fi 6E offers an additional spectrum of 1200MHz on the 6GHz band. This means you get fourteen 80 MHz and seven 160MHz channels over the Wi-Fi 6 standard. Hence, you do not get interference from nearby devices. Additionally, with the use of broader channels, the data transfer rates go up to 2400Mbps. Apart from a Wi-Fi 6E card, you need a router that supports Wi-Fi 6E. Usually, your ISP would upgrade this for you. Additionally, you need a data plan that offers greater download speeds.   \u0394  \u0394"], "https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-sitting-in-its-big-brothers-shadow": [" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT is a solid GPU that offers great gaming performance and massive improvements across the board over AMD's previous generation; however, creative performance is lacking, and it's somewhat difficult to justify its existence when the more powerful XTX version is only $100 more expensive. Excellent gaming performance Good value for money No 16-pin power connector Impressive generational improvements to ray tracing and AI Less impressive creative performance Average power consumption is quite high Ray tracing still lags behind Nvidia Pricing is too close to the RX 7900 XTX Why you can trust TechRadar \n\n\nOur expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. Listen... we really hope you're going to read the full review below, but we're going to make a big sweeping statement right now that might render all our hard work worthless: this GPU didn't really need to exist. Does that mean it's a bad GPU? Absolutely not. The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT is a very solid choice of graphics card, offering amazing gaming performance at a very competitive price point. Broadly speaking, it hits all the same high notes (and has all the same foibles) as the excellent flagship RX 7900 XTX \u2013 but that's sort of the problem. Let's take a quick departure from AMD to look at Nvidia's newest GPUs. The RTX 4090 is crazily expensive, but provides a monstrous amount of power for that price; conversely, the RTX 4080 costs $400 less at list price in the US, and is significantly less powerful as a result. With this in mind, the price disparity between the two new Radeon cards \u2013 a mere $100 \u2013 feels strange. As you'll see further down, the performance difference does mostly align with the gap in pricing, with the more powerful XTX card proving to be slightly better value for money overall. If you've got the cash to drop on a $899 GPU, you can realistically afford a $999 GPU, surely? Why wouldn't you wait a little longer to scrape together that extra hundred bucks, and buy the superior product? Therein lies the problem: while AMD has skilfully undercut Nvidia when it comes to the price-to-performance ratio of its new cards, Team Red is falling back into its old ways, and repeating the mistakes of the RX 6000 generation by already overcrowding the price bands of its GPUs. The previous generation had a 'too many cooks' problem, where lots of closely-priced variants (like non-XT and xx50 models) caused consumer confusion. We're concerned that we might be witnessing the beginning of a similar mess. Despite this, we can't really mark down the Radeon RX 7900 XT itself; the card performs admirably for its $899 price tag, with massive improvements over RDNA 2 when it comes to ray tracing and FSR performance. If you're looking for one of the best graphics cards for gaming on a 4K monitor, this is a sound pick \u2013 and it's damn good value for money, too. Most of the criticisms we can level at the RX 7900 XT line up with our issues with the XTX version of the GPU: it lags behind Nvidia in creative workloads, and uses rather a lot of power during general use (though still nothing compared to the mighty RTX 4090 at full load), and while ray-traced performance has improved significantly, it's still not up at Nvidia's level. Nonetheless, this GPU and its big sibling both demonstrate the huge potential of AMD's new RDNA 3 architecture, and we can't wait to see what AMD does next. If you need a new graphics card for your gaming PC and haven't been able to buy one \u2013 either due to scalping or crypto-mining bots hoovering up GPUs \u2013 then the Radeon RX 7900 XT is definitely worth a look.  The launch price of the AMD Radeon RX 790 XT is $899 in the US, putting it an even hundred dollars below the flagship RX 7900 XTX. UK pricing starts at \u00a3799, while in Australia it's expected to be somewhere in the region of AU$1,350. It's worth noting that these prices are only for the reference card produced by AMD itself, and the majority of RX 7900 XT cards on the market will be made by manufacturing partners such as Sapphire, Gigabyte, and XFX. These cards are likely to have their own individual retail prices, which may be a bit more expensive than AMD's list price. The card launched on December 13, 2022, which means you can buy one right now \u2013 assuming you can find one. Stock availability was predictably spotty during the initial launch, with scalped cards showing up on eBay and Newegg with horribly inflated price tags. Thankfully it seems that the $999 XTX card has borne the brunt of this, with XT stock still available from some retailers at the time of writing. In any case, the $899 price tag is indicative of AMD's desire to be as competitive as possible against Nvidia \u2013 a situation mirrored by the similarly aggressive pricing of the XTX card. Earlier this year, the previous-gen RX 6900 XT got a massive price drop from $999 to $679, further showcasing AMD's goal of providing seriously competitive prices for its gaming GPUs. Considering that the RX 7900 XT comes in at $300 cheaper than the RTX 4080, Nvidia is getting absolutely destroyed when it comes to bang for your buck. That's a 25% lower price tag, but as you'll see in our benchmark results later in this review, the RX 7900 XT only performed 15% worse than the 4080 on average. We're expecting Nvidia to respond with a price cut in the near future, although we doubt Team Green will admit the reason behind such a move. Sadly, we won't be adding either of these cards to our best cheap graphics card ranking, though we sorely hope that both AMD and Nvidia give us some budget GPUs in the not-too-distant future. $899 is still a lot to spend on a single PC component, leaving this GPU out of reach for many gamers.  GPU: Navi 31\nStream Processors: 5,376\nAI Accelerators: 168\nRay Accelerators: 84\nPower draw (TGP): 315W\nBase clock: 1,900MHz\nBoost clock: 2,400MHz\nVRAM: 20GB GDDR6\nBandwith: 800GB/s\nBus interface: PCIe 4.0 x16\nOutputs: 1 x HDMI 2.1a, 2 x DisplayPort 2.1, 1 x USB Type-C\nPower connector:\u00a02 x 8-pin The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT uses a cut-down version of the same Navi 31 GPU found in the flagship XTX card, and this change is largely reflected in the pricing, so top marks for AMD there. The exciting thing about this is the new chiplet design being employed for the RDNA 3 GPU die \u2013 or more accurately, dies, plural, since the chiplet design employs multiple dies with ultra-fast interconnects. The main 5nm node from TSMC is linked with additional 6nm dies for cache memory, a design choice that presumably enabled AMD to keep the production costs low, since the older 6nm nodes are cheaper to produce. This chiplet architecture was originally seen in AMD's own Ryzen and EPYC processors, and proved very successful in that arena. It's not hard to understand why Team Red opted to pursue the same technology in its GPU design too. In the same vein, both the XT and XTX cards use cheaper GDDR6 memory rather than the GDDR6X VRAM found in Nvidia's new RTX GPUs. The memory chiplets \u2013 plus additional cache memory \u2013 allows AMD to effectively skip over Nvidia and achieve more memory bandwidth for less money, another clear win. In total, there's 20GB of GDDR6 VRAM to play with here, which is 4GB less than the XTX model but still plenty for whatever you want to throw at this card. Combined with the new DisplayPort 2.1 video output, 4K and 8K are viable (though don't expect to be playing the latest triple-A games at 8K.)  Unfortunately, AMD is still lagging behind Nvidia's GPU market domination in other areas, even if some serious generational improvements have been made here. The second-gen Ray Accelerators found in the RX 7900 XT are a big step up from AMD's first-gen attempt, but they don't compete with the ray-tracing capabilities of the RTX 4000 cards (although it's worth noting that they do beat Nvidia's own second-gen ray-tracing cores as seen in the RTX 3090). We've also got new 'AI Accelerator' cores, which are roughly comparable to Nvidia's Tensor Cores in that they handle AI-related tasks such as deep learning. Nvidia is currently on fourth-gen Tensor Cores, so AMD definitely has some catching up to do when it comes to the AI capabilities of its GPUs. Lastly, even though the FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) upscaling tech has made some significant process in enabling ray-traced 4K gameplay on AMD GPUs, Nvidia's new DLSS 3 completely eclipses it thanks to full frame generation (rather than the pixel generation used by DLSS 2 and the current FSR 2.0). We do know that the currently-in-development FSR 3.0 will feature frame generation too, though, and FSR 2.0 can now be used in a much wider range of games.  Thankfully, AMD hasn't followed suit after Nvidia and made its new GPUs stupidly big. The Radeon RX 7900 XT is a lot smaller than the competing RTX 4080, measuring 287mm in length with a conventional two-slot design. It's a card that should fit comfortably in most standard ATX-scale PC cases, and hopefully third-party models from other manufacturers will stick to this sizing. It's comparable to any of Nvidia's RTX 3000 cards in size, which feels like a breath of fresh air compared to the comically huge RTX 4090. It's also just a generally good-looking GPU, with a straightforward reference design that looks much better than previous designs from AMD, which we felt looked blocky and old-fashioned.\u00a0  Beyond mere matters of aesthetics, the RX 7900 XT is equipped with a robust cooling solution that includes three fans and a solid metal shroud covering the heatsink. There's a small amount of lighting, but it's mostly quite a reserved design, which we like. There's room at the far end of the card for a GPU support bracket to be attached. A key difference between this card and Nvidia's new GPUs is the power connector found on the top. Unlike the 16-pin connector seen on the RTX 4090 \u2013 which has become something of a 'burning issue' for Nvidia \u2013 AMD has opted for a straightforward pair of 8-pin PCIe connectors, with no need for any sort of adaptor if you're using an older PSU. Since the RX 7900 XT draws just over 300W of power at full load, the 2 x 8-pin connector should be more than sufficient here. Interestingly, the RTX 4080 can use a total of three 8-pin connectors (which fit via an adaptor into the single 16-pin connector on the card) for almost the exact same amount of power, which arguably proves that Nvidia didn't need to mess about with those dodgy 16-pin connectors at all. Beyond the power connectors, the other ports on offer here are a good selection. We've got two of the aforementioned DisplayPort 2.1 ports, a standard HDMI output, and a USB-C video out port. The latter is the most interesting inclusion here, since it allows the support of a wider variety of monitors \u2013 including all the best USB-C monitors.  This is the system we used to test the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT: CPU:\u00a0AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D\nCPU Cooler:\u00a0Corsair iCue H150i Elite Capellix 360mm AIO\nRAM:\u00a064GB Corsair Dominator LED DDR4-3200\nMotherboard:\u00a0Gigabyte Aorus Master X570 (BIOS F36c)\nSSD:\u00a0Samsung 980 Pro 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD\nPower Supply:\u00a0Corsair AX1000\nCase:\u00a0Praxis Wetbench Let's face it: we can bang on about the features and physical design of the card all day, but none of that will matter if the performance doesn't measure up. Fortunately, the Radeon RX 7900 XT performs well in most areas \u2013 with a few small failings here and there. In terms of value for money, it's excellent. General gaming performance at 4K is good \u2013 all of our gaming test results below are raw results that don't use AMD FSR 2.0 for boosting framerates, so bear that in mind \u2013 and many synthetic benchmarks returned strong results. Unsurprisingly, synthetic tests such as 3DMark's suite of benchmarks showed performance slightly below the RX 7900 XTX and the RTX 4080, with the exception of ray-traced tests such as Port Royal, where the AMD cards were roundly outperformed by Nvidia. In many tests, the RTX 4080 sits between the two new Radeon GPUs. Averaging all our synthetic tests put the RX 7900 XT at about 10% slower than the 4080 \u2013 a very impressive showing given the 25% price difference. The biggest weakness of AMD's new RDNA 3 GPUs is indisputably the creative performance. In particular, Blender test scores were some way behind Nvidia's, although Blender is known to be better optimized to run on Nvidia's CUDA cores. On average the RX 7900 XT delivered less than half the performance of the RTX 4080 in creative benchmarks; however, removing Blender from the average brings it back to a 10% difference, marking that test as an outlier. AMD is apparently hoping to improve Blender performance via the use of a rewritten open-source programming language that takes better advantage of the existing hardware, changes that should arrive in Blender 3.50 and beyond. Until those updates land, though, anyone who's planning on using Blender (especially professional creatives) should really stick with Nvidia. It's worth noting that the RTX 4090 is still the best possible pick for these types of workloads; if you need a powerful GPU for working in Blender, don't settle for the 4080. AMD has made it clear that it wants to be the 'gamers choice' of hardware, so let's dig into the gaming performance on offer here. Broadly speaking, synthetic test results line up with real-world gaming benchmarks. The RX 7900 XT does struggle significantly with ray-traced workloads, but actually manages to beat the much more expensive RTX 4080 in F1 2022, and almost match it in Hitman 3 (oddly, both of these benchmarks are set in Dubai in-game; what's that all about?). Looking at a complete aggregate of gaming performance, the average framerate across all our game tests was 76fps \u2013 compared to 88fps for the RX 7900 XTX and 87fps for the RTX 4080. That's a decent showing against the competing Nvidia card, but doesn't stack up super-well against the XTX: it's 10% cheaper than the flagship Radeon card, but gaming performance is 13.6% worse. Since AMD is trying to make gaming the focus, it's a shame to see the XT model lag behind a bit; it's hard to recommend this GPU when the XTX simply offers better gaming performance for the price. Unlike the XTX, it's not quite as effective when it comes to 4K Ultra gaming as a result. It can clear 60fps in the majority of games without ray tracing turned on, but it's not quite as comfortable in its performance levels as the XTX. If you're willing to drop the settings ever so slightly you'll be able to hit high framerates, though. It's also worth reiterating that this was without FSR 2.0 turned on. You'll see from our scores that the RX 7900 XT didn't score well in Cyberpunk 2077, but turning on FSR 2.0 provided a huge boost, with and without ray tracing enabled. It's a massive difference, almost doubling the real-world framerate in supporting games. It's not going to be as effective as DLSS 3 on the new Nvidia GPUs, but it's seriously impressive when using the 'Quality' preset. Once FSR 3.0 lands, we could see an even bigger shift. These games do look great; with FSR 2.0 turned on, you can get some silky-smooth performance at 4K. Meanwhile, anyone playing at 1440p or 1080p is going to achieve some ludicrous framerates; don't buy this GPU if you're only going to play Valorant and Overwatch, basically, unless you have some sort of fetish for triple-digit framerates. Also, consider the refresh rate of your screen if you're going to buy this card; if you've got a 1440p monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate, you're going to max it out, so you might want to upgrade your display too. It's also worth noting that while ray-traced performance falls far behind Nvidia's cards, not many games actually feature ray tracing. It's still a niche feature that the vast majority of gamers just don't care about, so we can't really mark the RX 7900 XT down too heavily for that. DLSS 3 also isn't supported by that many games at this stage, so it's a minor advantage for Nvidia in practical terms. When it comes to thermal performance and power efficiency, the new Radeon cards lose out to Nvidia pretty badly. While the RX 7900 XT has very similar power draw and heat output at maximum load compared to the RTX 4080, our recorded minimums were massively above those of Nvidia's competing card. This means that while the TDP of the AMD GPU is actually lower than that of the 4080, it'll burn through more electricity on average. Breaking things down to a final performance average, though, the RX 7900 XT is good if not incredible compared to the other next-gen cards on the market right now. If you've got a $900 hard limit, this is a great choice of GPU. If you can afford a little more, though, we still think its XTX comrade is the rightful owner of the best AMD graphics card crown.  You've got a $900 limit\nWhile we don't imagine many people will have $900 but not $1,000 to spend, this is nonetheless the best gaming performance you can get at this price point. Nvidia has some work to do. You want high framerates at 1440p and 4K\nThe RX 7900 XT delivers incredible 1440p gaming performance, even if AMD's ray tracing tech isn't quite there yet. It can comfortably handle 4K without ray tracing in the majority of games, too. You only want a GPU for gaming\nIf you're exclusively looking for a gaming graphics card, this is a great pick. RDNA 3 falls down in creative workloads but provides massively better value for money than Nvidia when it comes to gaming. You're going to be using Blender\nIf you're a professional or hobbyist using Blender or similar creative software, Nvidia's new RTX cards are simply better. You need ultimate power\nLook, AMD's new GPUs are pretty great and offer pricing that will hopefully light a fire underneath Nvidia. They're just not the most powerful graphics card out there, though. If you need more grunt, spring for the RTX 4090. You're on a budget\nConsidering the recent price drop of the RX 6950 XT to an incredible $679, anyone looking to snag a powerful AMD graphics card without spending quite as much money should be focusing their attention elsewhere. AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX\nPay a little more, get a little more. The RX 7900 XTX is the definitive RDNA 3 GPU from AMD \u2013 so much so, in fact, that we have to wonder who the XT card is actually for. We really would recommend this GPU if you can afford the extra hundred bucks.

What is the difference between all the SATA ports ? Is SATA 6 faster than SATA 3 ? What is their signification ? And how to on what SATA port shoudl I connect my SSD and HDD ?\u00a0 \u00a0 Thanks for helping me  to know about sata, i suggest taking a reat trough its wikipedia article:\u00a0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA \u00a0 basicly, for a HDD it doesnt *really* matter, but an SSD you always want to plug into the fastest sata port on your board (probably SATA 3 6Gbps) \u00a0 refer to your motherboard manual to know what is supposed to go where. thats a label of the port so slot 1 2 3 4 5 6 \u00a0 BUT there is Sata 1.0 2.0 and 3.0 always plug it into 3.0 if you can \nThats that. If you need to get in touch chances are you can find someone that knows me that can get in touch.\n There is no sata 6 as far as I know. \nThere are sata 1,2 and 3. They are evolutionary steps, each I think doubling the speed. \nSo sata 3 is 6gb/s and sata 2 is 3gb/s and sata 1 was 1,5gb/s. \nThere might be more to this, but this is what I've learned from basic sata folk like me use. Stock coolers - The sound of bare minimum So where shoudl I plug this SSD ? http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820147372&_ga=1.36184038.717212593.1422753694 There is no sata 6 as far as I know.

If you need to get in touch chances are you can find someone that knows me that can get in touch.\n 1 Even tho it says SATA 3 ? Even tho it says SATA 3 ? sata 3 is the best interface \nThats that. If you need to get in touch chances are you can find someone that knows me that can get in touch.\n sata 3 is the best interface So SATA 1 or SATA 3 ?? Even tho it says SATA 3 ? SATA 3 is the standard for the SATA interface. \u00a0What you're asking is different. \u00a0You're not asking what SATA is, you're asking which SATA port to use. \u00a0Use the first one. QUOTE ME IN A REPLY SO I CAN SEE THE NOTIFICATION! When there is no danger of failure there is no pleasure in success. So SATA 1 or SATA 3 ?? Sata 1 slot Sata 3 interface \nThats that.

Or I need to connect it on a specific port ? Without the manual I'm not 100% sure, but use 1. Typically the first set of ports are on on the Intel controller, which unless you want RAID will be fine. All of your ports will have the same speed. Only thing I know for sure about that mobo, is you cannot use port 6, if you use the mSATA slot. \nProject Chromatic, aka: Iris the dekstop[\u00a0Case:\u00a0Corsair Obsidian 500D SE\u00a0|\u00a0OS: Windows 10\u00a0Pro 64-bit v 1809\u00a0| CPU: Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i7-8700K (OC to 5.1GHz all core, at 1.42V, AVX -2 [I know, not that great]) cooled by a Corsair H115i Platinum\u00a0| Mobo:\u00a0Asus Prime Z390-A\u00a0|\u00a0GPU: Asus - GeForce RTX 2070 8 GB DUAL (+240\u00a0Mhz core, +1000MHz mem) |\u00a0RAM:\u00a032GB (2x16GB) of Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro @2666 | Storage:\u00a0\n \n480GB Corsair MP510 boot, 1TB Samsung 860 Evo Steam drive |\u00a0Displays:\u00a0Left: Acer 222HQL (22\", basic 1080p60 for Discord and such), Middle: Dell S2716DG (primary, 1440p144 G-Sync), Right: Dell U2518D (1440p60, HDR for movies, and content, and the Switch via HDMI) all on a StarTech.com ARMBARTRIO2 triple monitor stand\u00a0]\n \nOther Tech:\n \n[ Phone: Samsung Galaxy S8, 64GB Black\u00a0|\u00a0Wearables: Samsung Galaxy Watch |\u00a0Consoles: Destiny\u00a0Special Edition PS4, Nintendo Switch with the better battery, and dark grey joy cons\u00a0]\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\u258cUse the quote button, or @username to reply to people \u2590\u00a0 Make sure to follow your TShoot topics to see replies \u2590\u00a0 Mark solved TShoot topics as such!\u2590\n Read it somewhere eons ago the correct way of saying it is SATA 6Gb/s but most just say SATA 3, since it's the 3rd revision of the SATA specs.

SATA3 and SATA6 refer to speed of the port. Where SATA3 is for SATA II and SATA6 for SATAIII. The SATA II and SATA III ports are really close in terms of performance when using regular HDDs. With SSDs its recommended of using SATA III since the ports speed isn't capping SSD speed like with SATA II. \nWith the MSI board you've used as example, you have all 6 ports powered by Intel chipset. They will work at full speed by default. If you would have board with 8 or more ports, all ports over the 6 would be using 3rd party controller and require driver for full speed and RAID operations. \n^ Like with my 8 port Gigabyte board which has Marvells controller for 2 ports, all SATA III. \n\t^^^^ That's my post ^^^^\n\t<-- This is me --- That's your scrollbar -->\n\tvvvv Who's there? vvvv\n You need to be a member in order to leave a comment Sign up for a new account in our community.

But even when he's not been singing about himself, Ed has always had a knack for telling relatable stories with certain a level of authenticity. They also just happen to be packed with undeniable hooks. Below, we delve into the numbers behind Ed's Official Top 40 biggest songs to reveal ten incredible chart facts, before revealing the full chart at the bottom of the page.\u00a0 \u00a0 Ed's total of Top 40 hits is currently at 47 - expect that to climb this Friday and in the coming months as he pushes more singles from =. Since making his debut with The A Team in June 2011, Ed has averaged almost 5 (4.7) Top 40 singles a year. Oh, and that 60.3 million figure includes 5.7 billion\u00a0streams. Perhaps unsurprising, but the lead single from Ed's Divide album is his biggest track in the UK, with 5.26 million chart sales (sales and streams combined.) The song enjoyed 13 consecutive weeks at Number 1 in 2017, seeing off challenges for Number 1 from himself (with Castle On The Hill, How Would You Feel (Paean) and Galway Girl), Rag'n'Bone Man's Human, and Chainsmokers and Coldplay's Something Just Like This, before being dethroned by Harry Styles' Sign Of The Times... and then returning to the summit for a final week. Ed and Beyonce collaborated on a remix of Perfect in 2017. Ed's big ballad from Divide was a near-instant pop classic upon release, and has logged 187 weeks to date in the Top 100 - his longest-running song on the chart by a considerable margin. With a little help from Beyonce and Andrea Bocelli, who featured on duet remixes of the song, Perfect claimed 2017's Official Christmas Number 1. It ranks second on his overall biggest songs with a mighty 4.14 million chart sales.\u00a0 A staggering feat, we're sure you'll agree. Ed's most recent single to tip over the 1 million mark is Bad Habits, the lead single from =, which places 18th on his overall Top 40. The sheer number of hits to Ed's name means it's basically impossible to pin one song down as his signature hit, but if you had\u00a0to name one, it would probably be Shape Of You. It's the UK's most-streamed song of all time, with an eye-watering 496 million plays. Ed with his Official Number 1 Single Award for Shape Of You. Ed's album tracks have a habit of finding their way into the charts from time to time (ahem), and this track from his Divide album peaked at Number 8 despite never been pushed as a single. It's currently Ed's 20th biggest song with 1.24 million chart sales. Despite peaking at Number 15 on the Official Singles Chart, Photograph - which served as the fifth and final single from his x album - is one of Ed's most enduring hits, placing sixth on his all-time Top 40 with 2.38 million chart sales. The duet with Justin Bieber trailed his star-packed No.6 Collaborations Project in 2019, and topped the Official Singles Chart for eight weeks. It places at Number 8 overall and leads nine collabs in Ed\u2019s Top 40. His biggest where he\u2019s not the lead artist is Stormzy\u2019s Own It (12), which also features Burna Boy. Ed and Justin in the I Don't Care music video. Co-written with Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid, Foy Vance, and produced by Rick Rubin for his x album, Tenerife Sea wasn't given the single treatment but still managed to peak at Number 62. A song dedicated to his mum, the track ranks at Number 31 in his all-time Top 40. Eight songs from Ed's debut album + have landed in the UK Top 100, but one that has been quietly bubbling away is Kiss Me, which places at 38 and has 585,000 chart sales, despite never entering the Official Singles Chart. \u00a92021 Official Charts Company.

The Divide Tour made him the first artist to repeat atop Billboard\u2019s annual Top Tours ranking, winning the gold in 2018 and 2019. The first of those two victories was the biggest year-end total in Boxscore history, with $429.5 million. Further, that tour ended in 2019 with the highest gross and biggest attendance of any tour ever, at $776.4 million and 8.88 million tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Mayer Reveals Who 'Your Body Is a Wonderland' Is About on 'Call Her Daddy' Holiday Special\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t12/06/2022\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tNow back with The Mathematics Tour, Sheeran winds up at No. 3 on the 2022 Top Tours chart with $246.3 million. But separated from gross revenue, his current tour is No. 1 on the Top Ticket Sales chart, ranking the top tours by total cumulative attendance. According to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, Sheeran moved 3,047,696 tickets in the 2022 tracking period. \n\tSheeran played 63 shows between Dec. 13, 2021, and Sept. 25, 2022, averaging out to 48,376 tickets per night. But that is a misleading number, as the first 11 of those shows were \u201crehearsal\u201d dates, setting the British singer-songwriter in small clubs and theaters in London and Dublin. Those shows ranged from 357 tickets at Dublin\u2019s Whelans on April 19 to 5,230 tickets at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall on March 27. All 11 shows combined to 16,810; even at the top of that range, he was still selling less than 15% of the year\u2019s average. \n\tRemoving those rehearsal shows from the equation, the picture of The Mathematics Tour comes into focus. Sheeran\u2019s 52 \u201cproper\u201d tour dates in 2022 paced 58,287 tickets. \n\tAlmost every market \u2013 each one except for Helsinki, Finland \u2013 required multiple shows. Sheeran mostly played double-header weekends, moving from city to city and maximizing audiences with Friday and Saturday shows. He topped off with a five-show run at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium, moving 420,269 tickets. \n\tAnd while there is no attendance-based chart for Boxscores, the Wembley streak does have the highest attendance total of any engagement this year, beating Coldplay\u2019s four shows at Paris\u2019 Stade de France by more than 100,000 tickets. \n\tElsewhere, Sheeran broke the 200,000 threshold with four shows at Manchester\u2019s Etihad Stadium and Munich\u2019s Olympiastadion. \n\tThese numbers are huge, but even compared to his record-setting predecessor, The Mathematics Tour is ahead of schedule. The Divide Tour included three European legs in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Those runs averaged 14,321 tickets (the 2017 leg was in arenas), 54,485 and 51,898, respectively. Sheeran\u2019s \u201922 stadium pace is 7% in front of Divide\u2019s strongest year, setting him up quite well as he prepares to leave his home base. \n\tThe Mathematics Tour is scheduled for 12 shows in Australia in February and March, followed by 24 shows in North America throughout the summer. Whether or not Sheeran can match (or even approach) The Divide Tour\u2019s three-year total may be entirely up to him. Fans showed up in droves to his European shows, but the expanse of his pre-pandemic tour was so huge. And not only did the tour last, it went wide, including shows in Asia, South America and South Africa. If Mathematics routing remains modest, it will be difficult to triple the tour\u2019s current totals. \n\tBased on his scheduled 36 shows in 2023, The Mathematics Tour should pick up another 1.5 million to 1.75 million tickets as it approaches the 5 million mark. Should more dates be added, the sky\u2019s the limit. Daily newsletters straight to your inbox Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

His first was born in 2020, and his second was born in 2022.\t\t\t \nFind Out\n  Ed Sheeran seems to have it all: Two No. 1 hits and multiple within the top 10 on Billboard\u2018s Hot 100 chart, four Grammys, and a beautiful family. He married high school pal Cherry Seaborn in 2019 after reconnecting in 2015 and they have since welcomed two children together. Read on to learn all there is to know about Ed and Cherry\u2019s two daughters.  A post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos)  Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran, Ed and Cherry\u2019s first daughter, was born in late August 2020. Reports that they were expecting a child only broke in mid-August, as Ed and Cherry were able to hide their pregnancy with the help of lockdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Ed announced the birth of Lyra on Instagram on Sept. 1, 2020. \u201cEllo! A quick message from me as I have some personal news that I wanted to share with you\u2026 Last week, with the help of an amazing delivery team, Cherry gave birth to our beautiful and healthy daughter \u2013 Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran,\u201d he gushed. \u201cWe are completely in love with her. Both mum and baby are doing amazing and we are on cloud nine over here. We hope that you can respect our privacy at this time. Lots of love and I\u2019ll see you when it\u2019s time to come back, Ed x.\u201d Ed and Cherry have never posted a photo of their daughter, but Ed was spotted walking with her in a baby carrier in London less than two months after she was welcomed into the world. The pictures, obtained by the Daily Mail, can be seen here. The publication reported that Lyra\u2019s name is inspired by the character Lyra Belacqua, who is the heroine of Ed\u2019s favorite book series, His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman. The outlet also said her middle name may pay homage to where she was conceived, as Ed and Cherry had gone on a trip to Antartica \u201cexactly\u201d nine months before she was born. While fans may not know what Ed and Cherry\u2019s bundle of joy looks like, it is known that she is healthy and happy. Well, besides when she hears her dad singing, apparently. In a May 2021 interview, Ed claimed Lyra doesn\u2019t like hearing his new songs and \u201cjust cries\u201d when he plays them. He said she enjoys his 2017 hit single \u201cShape of you\u201d, though. \u201cThe marimba sound is good, but she doesn\u2019t like anything loud or anything belt-y,\u201d he added. And in November of that year, he revealed she started to walk and talk, per Entertainment Tonight. He also claimed Lyra\u2019s first word was \u201cdad,\u201d although he admitted he wasn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s an accurate belief. In June 2021, the \u201cShivers\u201d singer said being a dad was the \u201cbest thing that\u2019s ever happened\u201d to him. He added, \u201cI think there\u2019s so many different sides and shapes to it. There\u2019s difficult days, there\u2019s amazing, easy days. It\u2019s just a rollercoaster of emotions. I know that sounds like a clich\u00e9 thing to say but it\u2019s amazing. I love it.\u201d  A post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos)  Ed and Cherry secretly welcomed their second daughter into the world in May 2022 and Ed took to Instagram once again to announce the exciting news. \u201cWant to let you all know we\u2019ve had another beautiful baby girl,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are both so in love with her, and over the moon to be a family of 4 x.\u201d The photo he shared was a pair of white baby socks lying on an ombr\u00e9 brown blanket. He did not immediately share the name of his newborn. \nRelated:\n\n\t\t\t\tCherry Seaborn: 5 Things To Know About Ed Sheeran\u2019s Wife & Mother Of His 2 Kids\t\t\t\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tEd Sheeran: See Photos Of The Grammy Award-Winning Singer\t\t\t\t\n Follow Us: About Us Legal News Connect"], "https://www.biography.com/musician/ed-sheeran": [" This content is not available in your area."], "https://gadgetversus.com/processor/amd-ryzen-5-processors-list/": [" Disclaimer:\r\n\r\nWhen you click on links to various merchants on this site and make a purchase, this can result in this site earning a commission.

While not as popular in the current era of solid-state drives, SATA hard drives are still sold in large numbers, and there are several good arguments for picking up a SATA hard drive over an SSD.  A SATA hard drive is a type of rewritable mass storage device characterized by respectable transmission speeds, excellent storage capacities, and flawless support by virtually all operating systems and computer motherboards. SATA hard drive can be found inside desktop computers, laptops, and servers. It\u2019s often easy to tell that your computer comes with a SATA hard drive because of the characteristic noise SATA hard drives tent to make when reading or writing data. SATA hard drives intended for desktop computers are typically 4 inches wide, 1.03 inches tall, and 5.79 inches long, and they are usually referred to as 3.5-inch hard drives. SATA hard drives intended for laptops are typically 2.7 inches wide, 0.37 inches tall, and 3.96 inches long, and they are usually referred to as 2.5-inch hard drives. Apart from desktop computers and laptops, SATA hard drives can also be found inside video gaming consoles, including the PlayStation 3 and 4, the Xbox 360 and One, and many others. According to a comprehensive analysis of the performance of 25,000 hard drives by the cloud storage service BackBlaze, we know that heavily-used SATA hard drives are reliable for approximately 3 to 4 years. In fact, brand-new SATA hard drives are more likely to fail than hard drives that have been in use for a year and a half, which is when manufacturing defects stop showing up and long-term wear and tear becomes an issue. Don\u2019t let these reliability statistics alarm you, however. Catastrophic SATA hard drive failures are quite rare, and most drives fail gradually over time. Initially, your SATA hard drive diagnostics tool (if you don\u2019t use any, we have a few recommendations for you near the end of this article) may give you a harmless warning, informing you about an unusually large number of bad sectors. After that, you may have trouble opening certain files, which could be an early sign of data corruption. It\u2019s only when critical system files become corrupted when you lose access to your operating system. When that happens, you need a capable SATA hard drive data recovery tool. The process of SATA hard drive data recovery is explained near the end of this article. SATA is an abbreviation of Serial Advanced Technology Attachment, a computer bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices. SATA is a successor to the Parallel ATA (PATA) standard, which was designed in 1986 and was for many years the most common and the least expensive interface for internal computer storage devices. But after the introduction of SATA in 2003, PATA started to fade away. Compared to PATA, SATA has several key advantages. Firstly, SATA cables consist of only 7 conductors instead of 40 or 80, making the interface much more suitable for compact desktop computers and laptops. Additionally, SATA supports hot swapping, a feature that makes it possible to replace or add a hard drive without stopping or shutting down the system. Furthermore, the SATA interface supports faster data-transfer speeds through higher signaling rates. The specification of the SATA interface is maintained by the Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO) non-profit organization, whose purpose is to provide the computing industry with guidance and support for implementing the SATA specification. Members of this organization include Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, SanDisk, Western Digital, and many other major hardware manufacturers. There are three major revisions of the SATA interface and three minor sub-revisions: Given the huge importance of SATA hard drives, it\u2019s advisable to become familiar with some of the most useful SATA hard drive tools available. With these tools, you can make the most out of your SATA hard drive regardless of its size or age.  Disk Drill is a comprehensive, feature-rich data recovery suite with several additional tools that you can use to keep your SATA hard drive healthy and your data protected. Unlike many other similarly powerful data recovery solutions, Disk Drill is available for free, and its user interface is as simple as it can be. If you at all value your data, make sure to have Disk Drill at hand in case your SATA hard drive starts acting up.   Download Disk Drill data recovery app Download now   TestDisk TestDisk is a handy, open source hard drive recovery utility with support for SATA hard drives. It can fix broken partition tables, recover boot sectors, fix MFT, and even copy files from deleted partitions. It runs on all popular operating systems, but you\u2019ll need some computer experience to use it because TestDisk is entirely command line-based. WinDirStat You know how available free storage space can mysteriously vanish just months after settings up a new computer? With WinDirStat you can reclaim the lost storage space by using the tool to discover the largest space hogs on your hard drive. Some of the most typical culprits include forgotten downloads or cached files and even huge software installations. GParted Whenever you need to resize, copy, and move partitions without data loss, GParted is the right tool for the job. This free and open source utility has been around for many years as a small bootable GNU/Linux distribution for x86 based computers. You can put it on a USB flash drive and keep it at hand for rare occasion when it comes in handy. VeraCrypt While modern desktop operating systems come with native SATA hard drive encryption mechanisms, there are good arguments for using an open source solution instead. VeraCrypt allows you to encrypt an entire partition or a storage device, create a virtual encrypted disk within a file, and set up a hidden operating system for plausible deniability. Data Recovery from SATA Hard Drives The first rule of SATA hard drive data recovery is: don\u2019t push your luck. As we\u2019ve said earlier in this article, hard drive failure is usually a gradual process that starts quite innocently but becomes more serious over time. Modern data recovery solutions such as Disk Drill come with disk health diagnostic tools, which let you evaluate how long you can expect your hard drive to live. The first thing you should do whenever your SATA hard drive starts to reach the end of its life is create a full hard drive backup. Again, Disk Drill can help you back up your data to another storage device, and it can do it with just a few clicks. But what if it\u2019s already too late? What if some important files have already disappeared? Believe it or not, there\u2019s still a good chance to get them back. Disk Drill can recover over 200 file formats using sophisticated data recovery algorithms that can detect even those files which your operating system can no longer see. You just need to be quick and use Disk Drill before your hard drive gives up entirely.

Thanks a lot for your help. Reddit is your friend. I found the guide a few days ago posted by a redditor there, here is the direct link to his blog. Hope it helps you fix your motherboard/laptop as it helped me fix mine as I have the same one.\nHP Pavilion 15-ec0101AX maintenance guide (pdf & fz)\n\nBest of luck Edit : It's free I just had to complete a quick survey to get the guide then the PDF appeared + the fz files (boardview files listing all the components on the motherboard's pcb), whereas all the others sources I found online were asking for $$ here you can just download the guide right after the survey and you're good to go. @WeldonHatteyer thank you very much mate exactly what I needed !!!  Hi I also have this HP Pavilion 15-ec0101AX and I downloaded the services guide above could you please tell me how to check my motherboard and what to look first exactly? I'm a bit lost when I look at all the measuring points and schematics in the manual. Cheers You can start by checking the charging connector soldered on the board you should read around 19v, and then check the 2 entry mosfets near this connector, look for a short circuit by doing a continuity test with a multimeter.\nD=Drain pin 5-6-7-8\nS=Source Pin 1-2-3\nG=Gate Pin4 \nHere are some useful resources as well for your hardware:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/655249/How+can+I+replace+my+keyboardLook at the comment #5919\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/i5ci9s/need_help_formatting_hdd/\n\nAnd here is a video that can help you get started to troubleshoot your HP Pavilion 15-ec0101AX too, watch from minute 7 :\n\n Downloaded the HP Pavilion 15-ec0101AX maintenance guide above, couldn't find it anywhere else for free, thanks for the download link you rock bro. Hi, I get 3v on the first pin of the bios chip, and 0v on the pin 8 is that normal?\nAccording to the schematics diagram in the manual and datasheets, I should have 1.8v there, right?\nHow to check the processor? Is my HP Pavilion 15-ec0101AX completely dead?\nMy 3v 5v regulator seems fine though since I tested the voltages and ground.  I suspect my HP Pavilion 15-ec0101AX has a short circuit somewhere cause it doesn't start anymore but I am totally noob and don't know what to begin with, the motherboard looks like a puzzle to me... I have a multimeter so I can try to fix it if it's not too complicated, how can I repair my MB please? I saw you can buy mosfets or capacitors and resistances online, chips as well like the super IO one, so why not try to repair my computer myself... Don't jump into the repair book and chip level right away. Depending on the problem it won't be the same approach. Does your laptop have any issue with the disply, or the power? Start with the basics by measuring the voltage at all the measuring points showed in the repair guide, and come back with all the measures so we can help you fix your HP Pavilion 15-ec0101AX. It's important to proceed step by step instead of quickly replace parts like RAM or graphics chip or even the processor, first thing first check if your charger is working. As simple as that. Also check your battery. Then you will go on and check the circuitry : coils, mosfets, capacitors, inductors, etc.\nIf you are a total beginner in electronics better take your computer to a repair shop to avoid causing more damage to it, even if it costs you a little bit. They can solder and desolder parts very quickly without taking any risk for the rest of the components.\nThey can also just check your HP Pavilion 15-ec0101AX and tell you what part is causing the problem, then it will be up to you to replace it if you prefer doing it yourself (a piece of advice when soldering, always use flux or rosin). I think I damaged my notebook while flashing the bios, is such a problem even possible? I tried booting from an USB drive with no luck it failed.\nI downloaded the HP Pavilion 15-ec0101AX repair guide it will help me make the right diagnosis, well I hope so. I guess I have some work to do now.

I'd like to measure the different chips voltage so if someone could help me find and download the hp 15 ec0101ax 167w1pa service manual it would be great.\nMy computer won't turn on anymore, no led when I plug the charger, it stopped suddenly while I was working on it. Thanks a lot for your help. Reddit is your friend. I found the guide a few days ago posted by a redditor there, here is the direct link to his blog. Hope it helps you fix your motherboard/laptop as it helped me fix mine as I have the same one.\nhp 15 ec0101ax 167w1pa maintenance guide (pdf & fz)\n\nBest of luck Edit : It's free I just had to complete a quick survey to get the guide then the PDF appeared + the fz files (boardview files listing all the components on the motherboard's pcb), whereas all the others sources I found online were asking for $$ here you can just download the guide right after the survey and you're good to go. @Macintyre thank you very much mate exactly what I needed !!!  Hi I also have this hp 15 ec0101ax 167w1pa and I downloaded the services guide above could you please tell me how to check my motherboard and what to look first exactly? I'm a bit lost when I look at all the measuring points and schematics in the manual. Cheers You can start by checking the charging connector soldered on the board you should read around 19v, and then check the 2 entry mosfets near this connector, look for a short circuit by doing a continuity test with a multimeter.\nD=Drain pin 5-6-7-8\nS=Source Pin 1-2-3\nG=Gate Pin4 \nHere are some useful resources as well for your hardware:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/362648/Help+my+to+replace+psuLook at the comment #4477\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/229134/Why+is+my+Acer+Aspire+One+KAV10+screen+scrambled+and+showing+snow\n\nAnd here is a video that can help you get started to troubleshoot your hp 15 ec0101ax 167w1pa too, watch from minute 5 :\n\n Downloaded the hp 15 ec0101ax 167w1pa maintenance guide above, couldn't find it anywhere else for free, thanks for the download link you rock bro. Hi, I get 3v on the first pin of the bios chip, and 0v on the pin 8 is that normal?\nAccording to the schematics diagram in the manual and datasheets, I should have 1.8v there, right?\nHow to check the processor? Is my hp 15 ec0101ax 167w1pa completely dead?\nMy 3v 5v regulator seems fine though since I tested the voltages and ground.  I suspect my hp 15 ec0101ax 167w1pa has a short circuit somewhere cause it doesn't start anymore but I am totally noob and don't know what to begin with, the motherboard looks like a puzzle to me... I have a multimeter so I can try to fix it if it's not too complicated, how can I repair my MB please? I saw you can buy mosfets or capacitors and resistances online, chips as well like the super IO one, so why not try to repair my computer myself... Don't jump into the repair book and chip level right away. Depending on the problem it won't be the same approach. Does your laptop have any issue with the disply, or the power? Start with the basics by measuring the voltage at all the measuring points showed in the repair guide, and come back with all the measures so we can help you fix your hp 15 ec0101ax 167w1pa. It's important to proceed step by step instead of quickly replace parts like RAM or graphics chip or even the processor, first thing first check if your charger is working. As simple as that. Also check your battery. Then you will go on and check the circuitry : coils, mosfets, capacitors, inductors, etc.\nIf you are a total beginner in electronics better take your computer to a repair shop to avoid causing more damage to it, even if it costs you a little bit. They can solder and desolder parts very quickly without taking any risk for the rest of the components.\nThey can also just check your hp 15 ec0101ax 167w1pa and tell you what part is causing the problem, then it will be up to you to replace it if you prefer doing it yourself (a piece of advice when soldering, always use flux or rosin). I think I damaged my notebook while flashing the bios, is such a problem even possible? I tried booting from an USB drive with no luck it failed.\nI downloaded the hp 15 ec0101ax 167w1pa repair guide it will help me make the right diagnosis, well I hope so. I guess I have some work to do now.

Last images posted on the forum   "], "https://geeksper.com/which-microphone-do-they-use/": [" There are many people who search for which microphones do celebrities and content creators use. Which microphone does drake use, which microphone does BTS or Joe Rogan use? Alright, in this blog post, I am going to share the microphones that they use for their performance or content creation. You will have an idea as a fan or a content creator. This is going to be a long post as I am adding many people to this list. You can check the ones you want through the topic outline section and jump directly to that section. Without further ado, let\u2019s start! Drake does not use the same microphone. He has changed many microphones since 2011. The microphone that Drake uses most of the time is his blue spark which he has used since 2011 when it came out. He also likes to use Shure SM57 and Shure SM58 for recording vocals. For acoustic instruments such as piano or guitar, drake prefers using Sennheiser 409 series microphones like Sennheiser e609 or S410 in order to capture both the soft and loud sound from these sources with ease. When performing live on stage, drake often relies on Audio Technica. 2011 \u2013\u00a0 Blue Spark 2011 \u2013 Shure SM57 and Shure SM58 2014 \u2013 Sennheiser 409 series Sennheiser e609 2015-2016 Audio Technica live on stage Joe Rogan is known for his podcast show. He has had the microphone from 1978 to 2000 which he used a lot when doing stand-up comedy too. He also uses Shure SM57 frequently, but Joe prefers using Neumann TLM 103 by Sennheiser because it\u2019s less expensive than all other models of this series yet still gives quality recordings with great sound reproduction that will not distort when played loud or soft. 2016 \u2013 Audio Technica live on stage 1978-2000: Electro-Voice RE20 Microphone 2000-Present Day: Neumann TLM 103 (Sennheiser) Barak Obama is known for the speeches he gave during his presidency. He mainly used Electro-Voice RE20 Microphone or a Shure SM57 microphone on occasion, but lately has been using Audio Technica live on stage and Sennheiser 409 series e609S microphones as well. 1977 \u2013 Electro-Voice RE20 1955 to 1977: AKG C12A Tube Condenser Microphone 2015 \u2013 Roland R88 Digital Recorder Bob Dylan is a singer-songwriter, one of the most influential figures in American music. He has used different microphones throughout his career but he mainly uses Electro-Voice RE20 or AKG C12A Tube Condenser microphones for live performances and concerts as well as Sennheiser 409 series e609S microphones for recording albums. 1977 \u2013 Electro-Voice RE20 1955 to 1977: AKG C12A Tube Condenser Microphone 2015 \u2013 Roland R88 Digital Recorder 2016 \u2013 Roland R80 Digital Recorder with K&M 212 mic stand. 2002 to 2006: Sony ECM220T Electret Mic Ribbon Microphones (x 16) on a chiming board hung from an overhead boom arm. Taylor Swift is both a singer and songwriter. She has used different microphones throughout her career but she mainly uses Shure SM58 or Sennheiser e609 series for live performances, concerts as well as recording albums. Taylor Swift prefers the Shure SE215-CL Earphones for both on stage and off. It features a detachable cable and handy in-line controls in a tangle-free design so she can easily hear what she needs without worrying about how her microphone cord might be wrapped around hair or bags during performance time. The Korean music industry has a ton of microphone brands, and you\u2019ll find that BTS switches between using different types of microphones so they can try out the nuances on every track to determine which works best for their style. For example, their song \u201cDimple\u201d was recorded with a Neumann C-12 because it suited the record\u2019s retro sound, whereas their more recent famous songs such as \u201cI Need U\u201d and \u201cSave Me\u201d were recorded with a Sennheiser e609 (as noted in RM\u2019s shoutout video). Originally the member V would sing vocals while playing guitar tracks live throughout concerts, but then he switched over to primarily producing beats after Min Yoongi introduced him to DJing. NPR uses Shure SM58-LC Cardioid Dynamic Microphone. This is a very popular microphone that has been used by many people for many years. The frequency range of the mic is from 50 Hz to 15 kHz, which provides excellent clarity and sensitivity across the vocal spectrum with low distortion levels while providing superior feedback rejection. In addition, it has an internal shock-mount system and can be easily plugged into any XLR input without requiring an adapter because it features a locking quarter-inch connector at its base. It weighs about 0.85 pounds (395 grams). Another great feature this mic offers is the ability to switch between omnidirectional or cardioid patterns depending on your desired needs to gain awareness when recording vocals or instruments as well. Broadway typically uses Shure, AKG, Sennheiser, and Audio-Technica microphones. All of these choices offer a range of solutions to specific needs in different theaters and with different budgets. Broadway is one of the world\u2019s most renowned stage production theatres with venues in NYC and London. Mark uses an MXL R144, which is the perfect match for his vocal stylings and love of life. Some people would say that this microphone is less expensive than a Neumann U87 or something with such prestige. Markiplier\u2019s microphone is so iconic to his personality and style. Travis Scott uses a Shure Beta 87A, which is an industry-standard for rappers and other vocalists. The mic\u2019s frequency response ranges from 20Hz to 18kHz and has been used with artists like Eminem, Jay-Z, Tyler the Creator, Travis himself. He also owns a Neumann U87 microphone that he purchased in 2017 as his backup microphone after having it stolen at one of his concerts. In 2018, he was seen using this mic on set during filming videos for Astroworld: Wish You Were Here (live concert film). Eminem\u2019s microphone is a Sony C800G which he has been using since 2000. The mic is best for recording vocals, drums, and guitar amps; it also produces clean audio with low noise in the background so that you can\u2019t hear unwanted sounds on your recordings. He was seen using this mic when Beyonc\u00e9 came to visit him backstage after one of his concerts in 2017 as well as during an interview segment from February 2018. One thing we know about Eminem: He never sticks with just one single piece of equipment \u2013 including microphones! Beyonce\u2019s microphone is a Shure SM58. The mic has been her go-to for performances over the years, and she even took it with her on tour when headlining Glastonbury Festival in 2014 (and reportedly used it to record vocals for the 2008 album I Am\u2026 Sasha Fierce). She also had an array of other microphones at her disposal \u2013 including Neumann U87s \u2013 but this was still one of them! It might not be surprising that the two biggest pop stars in recent history both use Shure mics; after all, they\u2019re industry vets who have platinum records between them. When she was recording her song \u201cHot N Cold\u201d in 2008, Katy Perry used a DPA 4088 Microphone. This microphone works with frequencies of 30Hz-150kHz and has excellent phase information. The DPA 4088 Microphone also has a low self-noise that makes it an excellent tool for sensing background noise sources as well. Ssundee uses Audio Technica AT2035 Microphone. This microphone has a wide frequency range of 20Hz-20kHz. The Audio Technica AT2035 Microphone also comes with an XLR connector and a shock mount to help reduce noise and feedback issues while recording, respectively. Billie Eilish used the Neumann TLM 103 Microphone. The studio microphone with a cardioid pattern is forgiving of any flaws in your recording space, has low distortion and great sound quality. It records audio from 180 degrees on one side to up to 60 degrees on the other side of a central line and includes sound under the microphone as well as from behind, above, or below it. These characteristics make it an excellent choice for miking drums, although it will work equally well for acoustical guitars or electric bass guitars. Do you have some more people in your mind? Do let me know. I will add them to this list with the microphone that they use. I hope you would have liked this post. This data might change as well. Thus, I will keep updating this post as soon as get more and more information. That\u2019s the reason why you should come back here to know what microphones your favorite star is using.

His incredible talent for playing and looping different parts into a seamless composition has made him one of the biggest pop stars of the time. He started singing in the church choir at the tender age of four and started playing guitar when he was eleven. Sheeran picked up songwriting while he was in high school and became known for his incredible performances. His schoolmates even voted him most likely to be famous. According to Sheeran, some of his musical influences include Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Eminem, and Paul McCartney. He credits Eric Clapton for making him want to play guitar in the first place. Ed Sheeran plays Martin LX1E acoustic-electric guitars of which he owns several customized versions of the model. Sheeran also has his own signature model of the LX1E produced by Martin. As for electric guitars, Ed often plays Fender Stratocasters, most notably his Eric Clapton Signature model. See the full list of Ed Sheeran guitars and gear below.  Ed Sheeran has always had a thing for smaller guitars. Earlier in his career, he played a Martin Backpacker acoustic, which is just about as small as you can get! Around 2009, he discovered what turned into one of his favorite guitars of all time: the Martin LX1E. The Martin LX1E, also called the Little Martin, is a 3/4 scale guitar. That means its body is about 3/4 the size of a standard acoustic guitar. Because of its smaller size, it\u2019s more comfortable to play and much easier to carry around\u2014which is great for a traveling musician and former full-time busker like Ed. The LX1E features a modified 0 body shape with 14 frets clear from the body, a solid Sitka spruce top, and mahogany back and sides. Despite its size, the LX1E features Martin\u2019s inverted 1 style crowned cross brace across the top of the guitar to maintain that iconic Martin projection and tone, even in such a small package. What puts the \u201cE\u201d in LX1E is the electronics. The Martin LX1E is the acoustic/electric version of their all-acoustic LX1. Ed Sheeran\u2019s early LX1E models (and his favorite) feature the Fishman Q Preamp. According to Sheeran, it\u2019s the best pickup for his percussive playing. Later LX1E models moved to a different system call the Isys T that Sheeran didn\u2019t like as much. Ed Sheeran bought his very first LX1E around 2008, just before he played the Suffolk Coastal Soundwaves CD launch. He hadn\u2019t quite made his big break yet, but he was very, very close. Over the years, he has owned several LX1E guitars, each with its own name.  In 2015, Ed Sheeran teamed up with Martin once again to create his second signature guitar model. This time, he named it after his latest album release, \u201cx.\u201d The Martin Ed Sheeran x Signature Edition is based on Sheeran\u2019s favorite little acoustic, the LX1E. It features the same 3/4 scale smaller body with a solid Sitka spruce top. Instead of the rosewood back and sides like the original LX1E, the x signature edition has beautiful koa wood back and sides, similar to his custom rarer 00-28VS. Like his first signature model, this guitar also has an \u201cx\u201d symbol on the body just below the neck joint. It also has little x\u2019s inlayed all the way up the fretboard instead of the standard dot markers. All Ed\u2019s royalties for the x guitar are also donated to Each, though the name isn\u2019t engraved on this particular guitar. Ed Sheeran played his Martin x Signature Edition back when he sold out Wembley Arena where he used it to play \u201cI\u2019m a Mess.\u201d Furthermore, these days one can see him playing this signature six-string along with its \u201cdivide\u201d successor version in regular rotation.  Eric Clapton was always a major inspiration for Ed Sheeran. In fact, he\u2019s the whole reason Sheeran got into playing guitar! To emulate his hero, Ed Sheeran picked up a Fender Eric Clapton Crash Stratocaster. The Crash Stratocaster is a typical Strat with a fancy paint job by a graffiti artist named John \u201cCrash\u201d Matos. Eric Clapton is an avid collector of street art, and back in 2001, Matos painted a Stratocaster-style body for Clapton with a custom graffiti finish. It became known as the Crash guitar, and Clapton used it as his main working guitar between 2001 and 2004. Ed Sheeran found a Fender Eric Clapton Crash 1 Stratocaster and just had to buy it. He used it on stage whenever he wanted to play electric between 2015 and 2017, typically on \u201cThinking Out Loud.\u201d Unfortunately, Sheeran found out that his \u201cCrashocaster\u201d is actually an unauthorized reproduction, so stopped using it onstage. Instead, he commissioned his own \u201cCrash\u201d guitar from the same artist. In 2015, Sheeran reached out to Crash and another street artist named Teddy M to paint a custom guitar just for him. The Crash x Teddy M Strat, as it became known, replaced Ed Sheeran\u2019s original Eric Clapton Crash when he played electric on stage until 2017. This is easily one of the coolest looking Ed Sheeran guitars of all time!  Ed Sheeran received his first Lowden guitar in 2012 from Gary Lightbody, the frontman for the Irish band Snow Patrol. Ed expressed an interest in Lowdens, and Gary simply gave him one from his own personal collection. Sheeran took the guitar and used it to record five songs on his album \u201cX\u201d (Multiply). Seeing how much Sheeran liked the guitar, Lightbody went to George Lowden, owner and head luthier for Lowden guitars, and asked him to make a special guitar to give Sheeran as a present. George created a unique small-body guitar he knew Ed Sheeran would love that would eventually become the WL series (or \u201cWee Lowden\u201d). The Wee Lowden series blossomed into a friendship between Sheeran and Lowden. It wasn\u2019t just a signature model; it was a signature series! It included several models in the S (small) and WL (wee Lowden) lines that now carried Sheeran\u2019s name on the headstock. Ever since his line went official around 2018, Ed Sheeran has been seen on stage and in the studio playing Lowden guitars, specifically the WL-35. The Lowden WL-35 features the tiny Wee Lowden body shape to make playing and transportation a breeze. It\u2019s built with Indian rosewood back and sides with a red cedar top. Lowden keeps everything simple and straightforward without any fancy inlays or decorations, and the dolphin-shaped X-bracing ensures premium resonation and projection, even from such a small package. To maintain intonation, the WL-35 is equipped with a split bridge. And for electronics, the WL-35 features an LR Braggs Element VTC pickup system. When it was first released, Ed Sheeran had a signature \u201c\u00f7\u201d model that had the divide symbol laser etched on the body of the guitar, similar to his signature Martin line. However, since new albums have been released since then, Sheeran is usually found on stage with a decoration-free guitar. The Lowden WL-36 has been Ed Sheeran\u2019s primary acoustic guitar since 2018. You can see the WL-35 in almost every recent performance, including his latest Tiny Desk Concert on NPR Music.  Although he hopped over to Maton for a little while, it didn\u2019t take Ed Sheeran long to miss his Martin guitars. After a brief stint with the EML6, he went back to his tried-and-true Little Martin. Except for this time, he chose the non-electric model, the LX1. The Martin LX1 is the exact same guitar as the LX1E that Sheeran played for the beginning of his professional career. It has the same 3/4 scale 0-shaped body, solid Sitka spruce top, and mahogany back and sides. The only difference is that it doesn\u2019t have any electronics. It\u2019s all acoustic! Of course, by 2012, Ed Sheeran was busy playing large auditoriums and festivals. There was no way an all-acoustic guitar would work! So, instead of going with the electrified LX1E with the Isys T electronics he already knew he didn\u2019t like, he just bought the non-electric LX1 and installed his favorite Fishman Q Preamp himself. There were a couple of Martin LX1s (with the Fishman Q Preamp) Ed Sheeran used between 2012 and 2013. As usual, they all got their own names, too.  Around the same time Ed Sheeran started working with Lowden guitars for his signature acoustic line, he also picked up a GL-10 to play on a few electric songs. The Lowden GL-10 was first introduced in 2018, making Ed Sheeran one of the earliest adopters of the model. Its super thin, single cutaway design makes it comfortable to play, which is exactly what Ed Sheeran looks for in a guitar. This incredible looking guitar features a solid Brazilian mahogany body and a gorgeous AAAA solid top (that\u2019s right, four A\u2019s). For electronics, the GL-10 is equipped with super smooth dual Lollar P90 pickups, a three-way selector switch, and three adjustment knobs (two volume and a master tone). All the hardware is gold to create a striking look against the amazing solid wood top. Whenever Ed Sheeran takes the stage to play \u201cThinking Out Loud,\u201d there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019ll have a Lowden GL-10 slung over his shoulder.  In 2013, Ed Sheeran teamed up with his long-time go-to guitar manufacturer to create the Martin LX1E Ed Sheeran Signature Edition. It was based on his favorite Little Martin, the LX1E, with a few special touches. Most obviously, the Ed Sheeran Signature doesn\u2019t have the standard blonde natural finish that\u2019s common for most Martin acoustics. Instead, it\u2019s made with Sapele\u2014which is a much darker wood that\u2019s similar in looks to mahogany. In fact, it\u2019s often called the \u201cpoor man\u2019s mahogany,\u201d since it looks and acts almost the same but at a cheaper price tag. The switch in tonewood was requested by Sheeran to keep the guitar affordable. Most signature guitars are much more expensive than the model they\u2019re based on. The Martin LX1E Ed Sheeran Signature is only $40 more than the standard LX1E. In addition to the darker tonewood, Ed Sheeran also added a few extra touches to make the guitar his. Instead of stickers or paint, his signature model has the \u201c+\u201d symbol laser etched into the body just below the neck joint. There\u2019s also a bright orange plus sign in the headstock with \u201cest. 1991\u201d underneath. Martin guitars typically have \u201cest. 1833\u201d (Martin\u2019s establishment date). Ed Sheeran added his own establishment date (birth year) instead. Where Ed Sheeran usually puts the name of his guitar, his signature model has the word \u201ceach\u201d etched into the body. Each stands for East Anglia\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospices, which is an organization that supports families and cares for children and people with life-threatening conditions in the UK. All the royalties Ed Sheeran receives for guitar sales go straight to each to help them in their mission. For pickups, the Martin LX1E Ed Sheeran Signature got the Fishman Isys electronics. It\u2019s just what Martin was using for LX1Es at the time. Of course, the Isys isn\u2019t Ed Sheeran\u2019s favorite, which is why he didn\u2019t play his first signature model very long. It accompanied Sheeran on the road through the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014 before he switched back to a standard Martin LX1 with an installed Fishman Q Preamp. Despite its relatively short run, Ed Sheeran used his first signature model on perhaps one of the biggest tours of his career, when he accompanied Taylor Swift on her Red tour! You can see Sheeran take the stage next to Taylor Swift with his sapele Martin LX1E Signature in this 2013 performance of \u201cEverything Has Changed.\u201d  Sometimes, even acoustic players need to go electric. Between 2014 and 2015, Ed Sheeran relied on a PRS McCarty 594 Hollowbody II for his amplified sound. The PRS McCarty 594 Hollowbody II is a gorgeous electric guitar from the expert builders at Paul Reed Smith. It features an incredible figured maple top and matching back, mahogany sides, a thin comfortable shape, and a completely hollow body with dual f-holes. Ed Sheeran\u2019s PRS had a Faded Blue Whale finish. For electronics, the Hollowbody II sports dual 58/15 humbuckers for a smooth, soulful sound, but that\u2019s not where it really stands out. In addition to the humbuckers, it also has a built-in LR Baggs piezo system for acoustic overtones\u2014perfect for an acoustic player who wants to dabble in electric like Ed Sheeran. Ed Sheeran used his PRS Hollowbody II when he played the 2014 iTunes Festival. You can hear and see this incredible guitar in this clip from a 2015 performance of \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d at Live at Rock Rio.  As if two signature Martin guitars weren\u2019t enough, Ed Sheeran returned to the Martin workshop yet again in 2017 to create another signature model. This time, it was to promote his latest album, Divide. The Martin Ed Sheeran \u00f7 Signature Edition has the same body shape as the tried-and-true XL1E Little Martin. The main difference with the Divide model is the tonewood. Instead of the spruce and koa combo of the last signature, the divide edition features laminated mahogany back and sides paired with a spruce top. The lamination is designed to make the guitar virtually weatherproof and resistant to warping\u2014perfect for the traveling musician! Aesthetically, the divide signature guitar shows a laser-etched \u201c\u00f7\u201d symbol on the body just below the neck joint and small blue divide symbols as fret markers all the way up the neck. The blue against the dark ebony fretboard makes quite the striking look. The divide symbol and headstock lettering are also blue. Ed Sheeran used his own Martin Ed Sheeran \u00f7 Signature Edition for much of 2017 after it was released. You can hear it in action in this performance of \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d from the 2017 Billboard Music Awards. Cyril was the first guitar Ed Sheeran ever bought, his first Martin LX1E, and the one that started it all. \u201cShe\u201d was used during his first proper performance at the Suffolk Coastal Soundwaves CD Launch. Back then, Ed Sheeran\u2019s symbol was a paw print, so Cyril had a paw print sticker stuck right to the soundboard. He even has a matching paw print tattoo! Sheeran used Cyril extensively between 2008 and 2010 for countless shows and recordings\u2014pretty much everything before his \u201c+\u201d album. Over the years, the guitar accumulated several other stickers. In 2010, Sheeran moved to the U.S. and put two more stickers on the guitar. They were both white and featured a drawing that was most likely done by Sheeran himself. You can see the new stickers in this video of \u201cGive Me Love\u201d from Hinge Studios in Chicago. You might also be able to see Cyril\u2019s name written on the soundboard, just above the neck joint. Because it was an earlier model, Cyril had Sheeran\u2019s favorite Fishman Q Preamp system, which helped get him hooked on the LX1E in the first place. It was ideal for his percussive playing style. Unfortunately, Ed Sheeran plays his guitars pretty rough. After almost exclusive use for two years, Cyril was retired sometime around 2011. Sheeran moved on to the next LX1E in line, which he called \u201cNigel.\u201d Nigel is another Martin LX1E with the same setup as his original, Cyril. It featured a natural finish and the same Fishman Q Preamp electronics that he loves so much. Sheeran picked up his second LX1E shortly after he moved to the U.S. in 2010. Like Cyril, Nigel also has a paw print sticker on the soundboard, except it\u2019s a bit smaller and at a slightly different angle. It also has \u201cNigel\u201d written on the other side of the neck from the paw sticker. Other than that, Nigel didn\u2019t get any other cosmetic alterations, aside from the worn patches on either side of the soundhole. Ed Sheeran used Nigel along with Cyril throughout 2010. Once Cyril was retired in 2011, Nigel became his primary guitar all the way through 2013, when he moved on to his \u201c+\u201d themed guitars to promote his newest album. By 2013, however, Nigel had also received his fair share of road abuse and had to be retired. Nigel accompanied Ed Sheeran for many iconic performances, including his appearance at the 2012 SXSW festival. Trevor was the first Martin LX1 Ed Sheeran bought. He picked up the guitar around 2012 as his first official \u201c+\u201d themed guitar. As with all his themed six-strings, Trevor had a plus sticker on the soundboard where the paw print sticker used to go. He also made sure to put the guitar\u2019s name on the top shoulder of the body. The first thing Sheeran did when he bought Trevor was to install his favorite Fishman Q Preamp system. He likely didn\u2019t like the Fishman Isys T Martin \u201cupgraded\u201d the LX1Es with, so he just made his own LX1E like he had back in the day. It was much better for Sheeran\u2019s percussion loops. Trevor and Sheeran tore up the concert circuit between 2012 and 2013, notoriously when Ed took on the stage during his Australian tour back in 2k13. At the beginning of 2013, Trevor had received his fair share of abuse from being on the road so much, so Ed Sheeran needed a replacement. He ordered another Martin LX1 without built-in electronics and installed his own Fishman Q Preamp system, added his signature \u201c+\u201d logo, and named it James II. The name James II implies that there was a James I at some point in time. At the end of 2012, Sheeran posted a statement, saying he was very sad about one of his beloved guitars breaking after just two shows. He didn\u2019t comment on its name, but it could be a safe bet that it was the original James I. Sheeran didn\u2019t waste much time replacing it with James II. Once he got James II up and running, it instantly became his primary guitar. For about the first half of 2013, the two were inseparable! You can hear the duo performing a rousing rendition of \u201cYou Need Me, I Don\u2019t Need You\u201d in a 2013 performance at the Artists Den. Every performer needs a backup guitar or two. James II\u2019s backup was called Murray. Murray was another Martin LX1 that came from the factory without pickups, but Sheeran made sure to install his favorite Fishman Q Preamp and signature \u201c+\u201d logo. Since James II held up better than its predecessor James I, Murray didn\u2019t get to see much use. It typically sat backstage waiting for its 15-minutes of fame. It did, however, get a few shows in toward the end of 2013 and into 2014. You can see the two play \u201cI See Fire\u201d at the 2014 Southside Festival. The final Martin LX1 in Ed Sheeran\u2019s arsenal is named Chris. Chris appeared on the scene in 2014 to use in tandem with his first signature acoustic model from Martin (which we\u2019ll get to). Chris had all the same features as its LX1 predecessors, including the Fishman Q Preamp system. The main difference is that Chris doesn\u2019t have any stickers or decals, aside from its name written on the body just above the neck. Ed Sheeran used Chris for a few appearances during 2014 between the releases of his first and second signature models. He might have even preferred the old setup over his first signature model, which could explain the swap back to the LX1. If you want to see Chris in all its non-stickered glory, check out this performance of \u201cI See Fire\u201d from a 2014 Live at BBC Radio performance. Once Chris was retired in favor of his second signature acoustic from Martin, Ed Sheeran never named his guitars again. Chris was the last guitar that ever earned a name. Toward the middle of 2014, Ed Sheeran went back to his favorite guitar manufacturer to make a few new custom models. This time, he strayed from the Little Martin and went for a \u201cfull-size\u201d 00-28VS Custom. The Martin 00-28 is just about as good as it gets for people who like smaller-bodied guitars. The 00 body has a thinner waist and overall smaller frame to provide a more balanced tone. Some dreadnaught acoustics go heavy on the bass overtones, but the 00 Grand Concert body style keeps everything in check to maintain an even sound. It also helps to prevent feedback, which is great for live performers like Ed Sheeran. This guitar features top-of-the-line building materials, including a Sitka spruce top sitting on top of East Indian rosewood back and sides. Top it all off with an ebony fretboard, ebony bridge, and tapered fingerboard to make the guitar play and sound as good as it looks! Ed Sheeran\u2019s guitar is a 00-28VS. The VS stands for Vintage Series, which means Martin takes a lot of care to reproduce the guitar just like they would \u201cback in the day.\u201d They age the tonewood so it resonates much better right out of the case. It\u2019s also finished with a few more vintage touches like special binding and an aged toner on the top. Because it was a custom job, Ed Sheeran also added a few more personalized touches to his guitar. In total, Sheeran ordered four Martin 00-28VS Customs. Two of them have intricate gecko inlays at the bottom of the fingerboard (which matches his tattoos). Instead of the East Indian rosewood back and sides, Sheeran\u2019s custom guitars are built with figured koa! Even the headstock is koa. It\u2019s hard to find a more beautiful acoustic guitar. To finish everything off, all four guitars also have an \u201cx\u201d on the front to promote his album, making them the first of the x-themed guitars. For electronics, Ed Sheeran went with the Fishman Matrix Infinity system. He typically uses his 00-28VS Customs to play ballad-type songs, though they\u2019re pretty versatile. You can hear Ed Sheeran talk about writing \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d and showing off his beautiful 00-28VS Custom with the gecko inlay in an interview with Acoustic Guitar Magazine. Most notably, though, he performed on All of the Stars with Christina Gimmie using one of his 00-28VSs without the gecko inlay. Ed Sheeran mostly plays acoustic guitars, but every now and then, he\u2019ll pull out an electric guitar to really \u201camplify\u201d his sound. When he goes electric, there\u2019s really only one amp Ed Sheeran turns to, a Vox AC15C1. The Vox AC15C1 might not be the biggest and loudest amp that ever was, but that\u2019s not what Ed Sheeran is going for. He wants an amp that puts out an amazing tone and is easy to carry along on the road. There\u2019s no better amp to serve those purposes than the Vox AC15C1. The Vox AC15C1 is a 15-watt combo amp that provides that classic Vox chime that musicians have loved for decades\u2014including legends like Paul McCartney, The Edge, Brian May, and Tom Petty, just to name a few. The main difference between the AC15C1 and the standard AC15 is the speaker. AC15C1 (the C stands for \u201ccustom\u201d) has a 12\u201d Celestion 25-watt Greenback speaker that\u2019s ready to pump sweet guitar tones well over the rest of the band, even in such a small package. It also helps provide a more mellow, mid-range sound, which is ideal for softer rock/pop like Ed Sheeran plays. When it comes to pedals and effects, Ed Sheeran keeps it pretty basic. He doesn\u2019t really use the standard distortion, wah, or reverb pedals like most guitarists. Instead, it\u2019s all about the loop pedals! When Ed Sheeran first started his career, he was a simple street performer roaming from corner to corner playing his songs. What set him apart from other street artists\u2014aside from his voice, guitar-playing abilities, and outstanding songwriting\u2014is his looping. Ed Sheeran likes to play all the parts for his songs, including rhythm guitar, lead guitar, percussion, harmonies, lead vocals, and whatever else he decides to cram into his songs. Since he\u2019s just one person, this makes putting on live performances quite a challenge. At least, without a loop pedal. Early in his career, Ed Sheeran used a Boss RC-20XL Loop Station to create his various sounds. It\u2019s a small, portable pedal that allows up to 11 separate loops and 16 minutes of recording time. It even has multiple inputs for mics and guitars, so you can loop whatever kinds of sounds you want. Once Ed Sheeran hit it big, he had some money he could spend on custom gear. He worked with his guitar tech Trevor Dawkins to develop a brand-new looping rig designed to meet his specific needs\u2014and to make it easier to loop a whole bunch of different parts. That\u2019s when they built the Chewie Monsta Lopper. The Chewie Monsta Looper is essentially four Boss RC-20XLs linked together on one pedalboard. It gave Sheeran so much looping power that he could easily conquer the pop music scene\u2014which he totally did. It also has two LCD screens that told Sheeran which parts were which, so he could easily keep track of the different parts and cut them in and out as he saw fit. After a few years with the Chewie Monsta Looper, it was time for an upgrade. Ed Sheeran once again went to his guitar tech Trevor Dawkins to create a new generation of Chewie looper. This time, they created the Chewie II Loop Station. The Chewie II did all the same great stuff as the Chewie Monsta, but with a bit more oomph. The Chewie II featured even more lights and screens to help Ed Sheeran stay on top of his parts. It also included a memory bank so Sheeran could save parts between songs and a couple more modes. Wrap Up Following high school, Sheeran started releasing independent EPs and promoting his music on YouTube, where he amassed an incredible following. He even received praise from Elton John himself! The more shows he played, the more attention he got. In 2011, Ed Sheeran released his first debut single \u201cThe A-Team,\u201d which was the lead single for his first full album \u201c+\u201d (pronounced \u201cplus\u201d). \u201cThe A Team\u201d hit number three in the UK Singles Chart and earned Sheeran international success. The album + ended up selling almost 800,000 copies and was certified platinum six times! Now grown up and with massively scaled celebrity status, Ed Sheeran has sold over 150 million records, making him officially one of the best-selling artists of all time. In 2019, he was even recognized as the UK artist of the decade by the Official Charts Company, and his \u00f7 Tour is still the highest-grossing of all time! After his success, Ed Sheeran never slowed down. He has released four studio albums and collaborated with some of the biggest artists in the world, including Beyonce, Justin Bieber, Eminem, Taylor Swift, The Weekend, Macklemore, and many others. In addition to a remarkable music career, Ed Sheeran regularly gives to charities and helps promote them to an international audience. His humanitarian efforts have raised millions of dollars for charities all over the world. Over the course of his decade-long career, Sheeran has earned countless accolades, including four Grammys (and 14 nominations), six Billboard Music Awards, and five Brit Awards. For his services to music and charity, he was also appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). Seeing that he accomplished all this before he even turned 30, there\u2019s no doubt that Ed Sheeran has a long, will eventually become one of the most respected artists of his generation.

I checked to make sure it was compatible and it is. Problem is that I can't get the laptop to recognize the card as a wifi card. Even saw a couple of youtube videos suggesting this card as an upgrade for the same exact laptop. When I first installed the card I went to the Intel download center and downloaded the wifi driver. Once it finished installing I checked to see if I could connect to wifi, but no networks came up. I checked Device Manager and the wifi adapter was not showing up. Check hidden devices and it wasn't there either. Next I fully uninstalled the old Realtek drivers (realized there were still some residual files/programs related to it) and attempted to install the drivers again. Still no dice. And this time I checked the Bluetooth section and saw that it did install the Intel Bluetooth drivers. I've already tried several times, but for whatever reason whenever I install the Wifi specific driver it only installs the Intel Bluetooth driver and not the Intel Wifi driver. I've also tried several of the troubleshooting steps shown on Intel's support pages, but I can't find anything on this issue where the wifi driver installs bluetooth instead of wifi. Link Copied Unless you actually installed the Intel Bluetooth driver package, you have the generic Microsoft driver. You need to install the real driver package since the Bluetooth subsystem shares the PHY with the Wireless subsystem. At this point, I suggest you do a clean install. Here is the process to follow: Hope this helps, ...S Hey, appreciate the suggestion. Unfortunately it didn't work. As a matter a fact I discovered another possible issue. I was able to uninstall the Intel Proset Bluetooth driver from my programs list, but I wasn't able to find anything related to the Intel Proset Wifi driver. Ended up doing a system restore to before I attempted to install the drivers and did a fresh install following your instructions. But still no luck. I got curious and checked the program file folders for each. While the Bluetooth folder had a drivers and docs folder the Wifi folder only had the docs folder. I'm not sure why, but I suspect its not installing correctly. I did download the files again in case the one I downloaded before was corrupted somehow, but it still didn't work. I even tried an older version of the driver, but still nothing. Yea, I've noticed lately that the Bluetooth package remains in the App & Features list but the Wireless package does not. This means Device Manager-based device uninstall is critical (and not automated). Hopefully this will be fixed. Meanwhile, after doing the installs, are you able to use the wireless? ...S No, still didn't work. I tried again and after doing a system restore again to make sure all the Intel driver were not present my OS started blue screening. Ended up having to reinstall the OS (thankfully not much on that drive so it was relatively painless). I kept the card in the computer, but even after a fresh install of the OS the computer still would not recognize the wifi drivers for the card. Only bluetooth appeared.

The singer-songwriter told BBC Two's Newsnight he did not have a choice but to defend his work in court. To protect against future claims, Sheeran said he now films all of his songwriting sessions.  A judge ruled on Wednesday that Sheeran had not plagiarised the song Oh Why by Sami Chokri. In their first interview following the verdict, Sheeran and his co-writer, Snow Patrol's John McDaid, told Newsnight of the \"extraordinary strain\" the case had exerted on them. Describing the court case as long and unpleasant for all involved, Sheeran said \"there was no other choice\" but to fight the claim.  \"You can get a judgement or you can have a settlement and [when] you know that you're in the right, then you can't settle just out of principle. You can't settle. \"Our royalties were frozen and we were given two options and we chose the option that was integral to us.\" McDaid added: \"In the last year, it got really heavy and it was consuming. The cost to our mental health and creativity was really tangible.\" This is not Sheeran's first time in court for a copyright dispute. In 2017, the 31-year-old settled a $20m copyright infringement case for his song Photograph, something he told Newsnight he now regrets doing. When asked if he thought that settlement had led, in part, to his most recent case he said \"the floodgates opened\". It also led to him reassessing his relationship with the song. \"I didn't play Photograph for ages after that. I just stopped playing it. I felt weird about it, it kind of made me feel dirty,\" he said. This video can not be played Watch Ed Sheeran's Shape of You and Sami Chokri's Oh Why And there have been lasting effects on the way he works. To guard himself against any similar claims in the future, the Grammy award-winning singer began filming all of his creative writing sessions.  He said he did not apply this protective measure to collaborative writing sessions involving other artists such as the Shape of You writing sessions with McDaid and producer Steven McCutcheon. But he said: \"Now I just film everything, everything is on film. \"We've had claims coming through on the songs and we go, well here's the footage and you watch. You'll see there's nothing there.\" And his experience of songwriting has been tainted: \"There's the George Harrison point where he said he's scared to touch the piano because he might be touching someone else's note. There is definitely a feeling of that in the studio. \"I personally think the best feeling in the world is the euphoria around the first idea of writing a great song. \"That feeling has now turned into 'oh wait, let's stand back for a minute'. You find yourself in the moment, second-guessing yourself.\" McDaid called for more open discussion between all members of the music industry rather than more litigation.  \"I think there's obvious holes in the system at the moment. If I can go to a musicologist and get a report and take that report and they can freeze someone's income based on that... that's a problem. \"It creates a culture where it can be used as a threat and I think we need to be having conversations with societies, with managers, with artists, songwriters and say this isn't OK for anybody.\" They both spoke of their relief that the years-long process had come to an end. \"I'm happy it's over. I'm happy we can move on and get back to writing songs,\" said Sheeran. Watch the full interview on Newsnight at 22:30 BST on Friday 8 April on BBC Two.

Well, today is your lucky day as Sheeran announced he\u2019s collaborating with The Pok\u00e9mon Company on a brand new song. The tune is called \u201cCelestial\u201d and will release very soon. Sheeran announced the move with a tweet and a fun hand-drawn comic of him with Pikachu on his shoulder.  Ed x @pokemon collaboration confirmed, we love to see it! \u2018Celestial\u2019 will be out September 29th \u2728 https://t.co/rKOG5Thot1 pic.twitter.com/FzHJj7YO5k \u201cEd x @pokemon collaboration confirmed; we love to see it! \u2018Celestial\u2019 will be out September 29th,\u201d the tweet said, with a link to pre-save the song.  This isn\u2019t even the first time the two pop culture giants have collaborated, either. Last year Sheeran performed a live concert on the Pok\u00e9mon GO app. Sheeran has previously shared his love for Pok\u00e9mon publicly, so the collaboration isn\u2019t actually all that surprising. All the way back in 2011, Sheeran expressed his love for a specific Pok\u00e9mon game. Pokemon black for the DS is wicked \u201c[Pok\u00e9mon] black for the DS is wicked,\u201d he said, which is a statement that holds up all these years later. Say what you will about Sheeran; the man knows how to put together a pop song. For those who can\u2019t wait until later in the week when the song comes out, Sheeran uploaded a snippet of himself playing the song on a bed with seemingly too many plush Pok\u00e9mons (or not enough, apparently). \u201cThis is only half of the collection,\u201d the singer wrote in the caption. The song sounds like a nice ballad that would get played at weddings. Honestly, it will probably get played at weddings. \u201cCelestial\u201d releases on Sept. 29."], "https://blog.macfixit.com.au/what-is-the-difference-between-sata-i-sata-ii-and-sata-iii/": [" This is a question that our customer service representatives get asked almost every week and there is a reason why. While most people know what SATA is, it get\u2019s quite confusing to differentiate between the different revisions of the interface, here is a quick explanation : SATA I\u00a0(revision 1.x) interface, formally known as\u00a0SATA 1.5Gb/s, is the first generation SATA interface running at\u00a01.5 Gb/s. The bandwidth throughput, which is supported by the interface, is up to 150MB/s. SATA II\u00a0(revision 2.x) interface, formally known as\u00a0SATA 3Gb/s, is a second generation SATA interface running at 3.0 Gb/s. The bandwidth throughput, which is supported by the interface, is up to 300MB/s. SATA III\u00a0(revision 3.x) interface, formally known as\u00a0SATA 6Gb/s, is a third generation SATA interface running at 6.0Gb/s. The bandwidth throughput, which is supported by the interface, is up to 600MB/s. This interface is backwards compatible with SATA 3 Gb/s interface. SATA II specifications provide backward compatibility to function on SATA I\u00a0ports. SATA III specifications provide backward compatibility to function on SATA I and SATA II ports. However, the maximum speed of the drive will be slower due to the lower speed limitations of the port. Special note for specific 2009 iMacs, 2008-2010 MacBooks & 2008-2009 MacBook Pros. We highly recommend the use of a SATA 2.0 (3Gb/s) SSD such as the OWC Mercury Electra 3G for the following Macs: While a 6G SSD does function, it will only do so at SATA Revision 1.0 (1.5Gb/s, 150MB/s) speeds rather that the SATA Revision 2.0 (3.0Gb/s 300MB/s) speed the computer can deliver. What about the future ? SATA III is starting to show some limits now with the latest generation of \u00a0Thunderbolt 2 (20Gb/s) is showing up everywhere. With the ongoing race against speed it seems that the next step for quicker storage will be towards PCI SSD that will allow us to get over the limitation of SATA connectors. Comments are closed.

It's one thing having him on mine, but being on his, that's an honour that you can't ever pinpoint on how great that is. I did something for his record, and I was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso,' appearing as a guest on Clapton's \"I Will Be There\", in addition to performing the song with Clapton on stage, and he did something for my record performing a guitar solo on \"Dive\" on Sheeran's album \u00f7 and was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso.'\"[22] Sheeran also cited Taylor Swift as one of his influences, suggesting in 2015 their respective success drives each other on.[203]\n In March 2015, Sheeran announced he was setting up a record label, Gingerbread Man Records, which is a deal with Warner Music Group.[204] The label was launched in August 2015 alongside its accompanying YouTube channel.[205] Jamie Lawson, the label's first signee, met Sheeran while they were both in London's folk circuit.[206] Lawson released his self-titled debut album on 9 October 2015, which has earned him a number one in the UK Albums Chart.[207] Sheeran signed his second artist, Foy Vance, in November 2015.[208] Maisie Peters also signed with the label in 2021.[209]\n On 29 September 2019, Sheeran announced he was teaming up with his manager Stuart Camp to open a bar located on Portobello Road in Notting Hill.

And with certain subjects like this they're often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve.\" Tickets were available to those taking part in the charity's Give it up for One25 campaign by giving something up for 125 hours and hitting the \u00a340,000 fundraising mark.[211]\n Sheeran often wears hoodies or tartan shirts, and frequently donates his clothes to charity shops in Suffolk Sheeran frequently gives away his clothes to charity shops around Suffolk, his home county.[212] An ambassador for East Anglia's Children's Hospice, he has donated clothes to the St Elizabeth Hospice charity shop in his home town Framlingham, including eight bags of clothes to the shop in February 2014.[213] In 2016 he donated 13 bags of clothes to the shop.[214] The tartan shirt worn by Sheeran when he met Renee Zellweger's character, Bridget, in Bridget Jones's Baby, was auctioned online to raise further funds for the hospice.[214]\n On 15 November 2014, Sheeran joined the charity supergroup Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the West African Ebola virus epidemic.[215]\n In November 2015, Sheeran supported the No Cold Homes campaign by the UK charity, Turn2us.[216] Sheeran was one of nearly thirty celebrities, which included Helen Mirren, Jeremy Irons and Hugh Laurie, to donate items of winter clothing to the campaign, with the proceeds used to help people in the country struggling to keep their home warm in winter.[217]\n Sheeran teamed up with the cast of the BBC3 mockumentary sitcom People Just Do Nothing to perform a charity single for the BBC's biennial telethon Comic Relief which aired in March 2017.[218] He appeared in a November 2017 episode of Gogglebox along with other UK celebrities such as Ozzy Osbourne, former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn as part of Channel 4 and Cancer Research UK's Stand Up to Cancer fundraising campaign.[219]\n In December 2019, he launched his own music foundation, Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation (ESSMF).

As the other wealthy diners look on in horror at the sight of a ketchup bottle, he flips the bottle, bangs it against his hand to budge the ketchup and smothers it all over his food. The company released a limited edition ketchup product known as Ed Sheeran X Heinz ketchup, also known as \"Heinz Edchup\".[236]\n Released in June 2019, Sheeran appeared as himself in a supporting role in the Richard Curtis/Danny Boyle film Yesterday, a film about a struggling singer-songwriter who wakes up to find that no one but he remembers the Beatles.[239]\n Music journalist Alexis Petridis has stated that Ed Sheeran \"brought pop back down to earth\" with his music style, introducing himself \"touting an even more austere version of Coldplay's dressed-down authenticity: one unassuming man, his guitar and a loop pedal\". Noting him as \"one of the most influential\" artists of his generation, as he spawned \"endless imitators\", Petridis remarked that the music charts were \"packed with Sheeran-alikes\" after \u00d7, describing it as \"the wave of earnest, dressed-down, boy-next-door troubadours\" that reached critical mass.[240] Similarly, The Guardian writer Laura Snapes cited him as \"the godfather of the current crop of singer-songwriters\" in 2019, stating that Sheeran inspired \"troubadours\" to enter the music charts, and marked \"the calcification of the everyman male pop star\", and the end of record labels marketing them \"exclusively to teenage girls and their mums.\"[241] Billboard writer Jason Lipshutz noticed that his appeal and performance style had influenced up-and-coming soloists, impacting \"a significant number of pop artists who crave his type of singular success.\"[242] The Financial Times considered that the scale of Sheeran's commercial accomplishments has \"broken through to such a wide and lucrative extent, far beyond the achievements of any of the other singer-songwriters in the market\" in the UK.[243]\n iHeartMedia senior executive Sharon Dastur declared that Sheeran's success has allowed newer artists to be given an opportunity in the mainstream scene with quieter material at the forefront, instead of dance music.[242] GQ's George Chesterton deemed Sheeran \"the de facto voice of a generation\" as a consequence of his music reflecting his personality and \"the defining characteristics of his audience\", with such recurring qualities of his discography corresponding \"with those that his own generation, the millennials, most value: authenticity, realness, earnestness, sincerity.\"[244] BBC Radio 1 executive George Ergatoudis has stated that his \"lyrical candour\" and his \"professional hunger\" resonated with younger listeners, giving him a \"very clear edge\" to breakthrough in a music industry that  is \"saturated with singer-songwriters\", while Sheeran's \"niche combination\" has made him able to perform at hip-hop, grime and underground events and \"convince the urban crowd that he was authentic\".[243] According to Vox, Sheeran has reached \"global pop culture ubiquity\".[245] In 2017, the BBC named him the second-best performing artist of the decade, after Adele,[246] while in 2021, The Independent said he had \"one of the biggest pop careers of this generation.\"[247] Billboard,[248] The Financial Express,[249] Brandon Sun,[250] and Arab News[251] have cited him as a \"British music icon\".

He has stated that he hopes to raise a family there.[73][263] During 2013, he lived between Hendersonville, Tennessee[264] and Los Angeles, California.[265] In 2014, he bought a house in South London.[73]\n Sheeran was in a relationship with Scottish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt (who was in his music video for \"Drunk\") in 2012, before breaking up.[266] Nesbitt is the subject of Sheeran's songs \"Nina\" and \"Photograph\", while most of Nesbitt's album, Peroxide, is about Sheeran.[266] In 2014, Sheeran was in a relationship with Athina Andrelos, who works for chef Jamie Oliver.[267] She is the inspiration of Sheeran's song \"Thinking Out Loud\".[268] They broke up in February 2015.[268] He is also close friends with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift; the pair collaborated on her albums Red (original and re-recorded versions) and Reputation, as well as on a remix of the song \"The Joker and the Queen\" from Sheeran's album =.[22][269]\n In July 2015, Sheeran began a relationship with childhood friend and former secondary school classmate Cherry Seaborn.[270] They announced their engagement in January 2018 and were married a year later.[271][272] She is the inspiration of the song \"Perfect\".[273] It was reported on 12 August 2020 that the couple were expecting their first child.[274][275] On 1 September, Sheeran announced on Instagram that Seaborn had given birth to a baby girl the previous week.[276] On 19 May 2022, it was announced that the couple's second child, a girl, was born.[277]\n Sheeran is a supporter of his local football club Ipswich Town,[278] and his +\u2013=\u00f7x Tour kit sponsored their 2021\u201322 season.[279] Additionally, Sheeran was named in the club's squad list and given the squad number of 17.[280] A collector of Panini's FIFA World Cup sticker album, he completed the 2014 World Cup album.[281] Appearing as a guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on 7 May 2017, Sheeran chose His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman as his book of choice, and a lifetime supply of ketchup as the one inanimate luxury item that he would take with him on a desert island.[282]\n In June 2015, Forbes listed his earnings at $57\u00a0million for the previous 12 months, and ranked him the 27th-highest-earning celebrity in the world.[283] In July 2018, Forbes named Sheeran 9th on their list of the highest paid celebrities.[284] According to The Sunday Times Rich List of 2019, Sheeran is worth \u00a3160 million ($207 million) as the 17th richest musician in the UK.[285] Sheeran's net worth is estimated at \u00a3200 million in 2020.[286]\n On 24 October 2021, Sheeran tested positive for COVID-19 less than a week before the release of his fifth album.[287]\n In 2017, Sheeran settled out of court over claims his song \"Photograph\" was a \"note-for-note\" copy of the chorus in the song \"Amazing\" by X Factor UK winner Matt Cardle.[288] In 2018, legal action was brought against Sheeran, Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Atlantic Records by the estate and heirs of the late producer Ed Townsend, who co-wrote the song \"Let's Get It On\" with Marvin Gaye. US District Judge Louis Stanton rejected Sheeran's call in 2019 for dismissal of a legal case accusing him of copying parts of the song in \"Thinking Out Loud\". Stanton said that a jury should decide but that he found \"substantial similarities between several of the two works' musical elements\".[289] A previous case by Townsend's estate was dismissed without prejudice in February 2017.[290]\n Sheeran was taken to court in March 2022 for a copyright lawsuit over \"Shape of You\". Musicians Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue alleged that the song infringed \"particular lines and phrases\" of their 2015 composition \"Oh Why\".[291] Sheeran won the case, with Mr Justice Zacaroli ruling he \"neither deliberately nor subconsciously\" copied a phrase from Oh Why when writing Shape of You.[292][293]\n Sheeran publicly opposed Brexit (the United Kingdom leaving the European Union), and supported \"remain\". Following the June 2016 referendum result where the British public voted to leave, Sheeran was among a group of British musicians (which included Sting, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason and Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz) who signed a letter to then Prime Minister Theresa May, drafted by Bob Geldof in October 2018, calling for \"a 2nd vote\". Stating that Brexit will \"impact every aspect of the music industry. From touring to sales, to copyright legislation to royalty collation\", the letter adds: \"We dominate the market and our bands, singers, musicians, writers, producers and engineers work all over Europe and the world and in turn, Europe and the world come to us. Why? Because we are brilliant at it ... [Our music] reaches out, all inclusive, and embraces anyone and everyone. And that truly is what Britain is.\"[294]\n In 2017, Sheeran publicly endorsed the centre-left British Labour Party and described himself as a \"fan\" of its then-leader Jeremy Corbyn, while adding that \"I'm not Mr Political.

The prior difference between SATA and PATA is that the SATA is later technology which is fast, more efficient and small in size relative to PATA an earlier technology.\u00a0The Parallel ATA has various limitations related to signal period, integrity and electromagnetic interference.  \n\n\n\nBasis for comparisonSATAPATA\n\n\n\n\nExpands toSerial ATAParallel ATA\n\n\nStatusCurrently in useOutdated\n\n\nSpeedFastModerate\n\n\nHot swappingSupportedDoes not support hot-pluggable devices.\n\n\nExternal interfaceProvidedNo provision for external interface.\n\n\nMaximum cable length 39.6 inches18 inches\n\n\nCable sizeSmallerLarge\n\n\nBit rate150 MB/s - 600 MB/s16 MB/s - 133 MB/s\n\n\n\n\n SATA stands for Serial ATA is computer bus interface used for connecting the bus adapters to the storage devices like hard disk drives. It is advantageous over the PATA as it provides decreased cable size and cost, high data transfer speed, and hot swapping, etcetera. The SATA devices and host adapters interact through the high-speed serial cable over the conductors. It is backwardly compatible because it uses Primary ATA and ATAPI command group as legacy ATA devices. SATA brought a huge change in the computer hardware where it replaced parallel ATA in customer desktop and laptop computers and also in new embedded applications. The fundamental SATA connector has two twisted pairs, three ground wires and 7 pins. It implements differential transmission with the clock frequencies varying from 1.5 to 6.0 Gigabits per second. The latter version of SATA also provides isochronous transmission characteristics to enable audio and video devices. To enable hotplug and (NCQ) Native Command Queuing\u00a0an enhanced technology is implemented in SATA i.e., AHCI (Advanced Host Controller Interface). PATA (Parallel ATA) is the latter version of ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment) and the former version of SATA. As mentioned above these AT attachments are the interface standard for the connection of storage devices (hard disks, floppy drives and optical disks). X3/INCITS committee maintains the standard and uses AT attachment (ATA) and AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) standards. The PATA standard is the outcome of the gradual development which was initiated with the original AT attachment interface used in the older PC AT equipment. After the development of the SATA, the basic ATA is renamed as PATA. In PATA the length of the cable can be 18 inches at maximum (457.2 mm). Due to a short length of PATA cables, these are only useful for the internal computer storage interface. A 16-bit wide data bus is used in the PATA along with supplementary support and control signals. It functions at a low frequency and has 40 pin connectors linked to the ribbon cable. Every cable has two or three connectors, among which one is connected to the adapter interfacing and remaining are plugged into drives.   Among SATA and PATA, Serial-ATA offers several benefits over the Parallel-ATA such as fast data transfer, reduced size of the massive 40 pin connector and cable.

Although this doesn\u2019t mean that all of the listed GPUs will launch this year (or at all), it does give us some insight into the exact models that AMD and Nvidia may be readying for their new lineups. There\u2019s also a hidden surprise that shows Nvidia may not be quite done with the RTX 30-series GPUs just yet. [EEC]\u2013 NVIDIA RTX 40 series and RTX 30 Super series\u2013 AMD RX 7000 serieshttps://t.co/1p8cVDjtsxhttps://t.co/3MfkecGem9 pic.twitter.com/Rwy2o4FCCd &mdash; \ud3ec\uc2dc\ud3ec\uc2dc (@harukaze5719) July 26, 2022 The EEC is a trademark registry and because of that, it often serves as a source of product leaks. There\u2019s no guarantee that all of the listed products will make it to the market, but the registry works as an indication that the manufacturer is likely to be working on these products. We\u2019ve seen several EEC leaks in the past, and usually, the majority of the products end up being released. Even so, until AMD and Nvidia confirm these, it\u2019s best to maintain a dose of skepticism. The registration comes from AFOX, a partner for both AMD and Nvidia, which will seemingly plan to produce custom versions of the cards. The company makes other kinds of PC hardware aside from graphics cards, including motherboards, power supply units, and storage. This time, AFOX seems to be getting ready to work on a long list of AMD and Nvidia graphics cards. First spotted by Twitter leaker Harukaze5719, the EEC listings include the full range of Nvidia\u2019s next-gen RTX 40-series \u201cAda Lovelace\u201d graphics cards. This means the following GPUs: While most of the lineup was expected, the RTX 4090 Ti has been the subject of some speculation. This intensely powerful GPU might instead be a continuation of Nvidia\u2019s RTX Titan series as opposed to an RTX Ti. Curiously, AFOX has also chosen to list several RTX 30-series graphics cards under the name RTX Super: The GeForce RTX 3090 Super, RTX 3080 Super, RTX 3070 Super, and the RTX 3060 Super. However, given that Nvidia is currently suffering from a major oversupply of graphics cards that it still needs to unload before the next-gen launches, it seems unlikely that it will go back to create even more RTX 30-series GPUs. In fact, some sources speculate that Nvidia may opt to only release a single RTX 40 GPU this year in order to try and sell more of the current-gen cards. AFOX may just be optimistic here, or simply trying to cover all bases. The company hasn\u2019t snubbed AMD \u2014 on the contrary, it registered just about every AMD GPU variant possible. This includes the following: While we don\u2019t know for a fact that all of these graphics cards will end up getting released, the EEC listings are a good indicator that production is well underway and AMD\u2019s and Nvidia\u2019s board partners are getting ready. With both AMD and Nvidia set to launch new products this year, we\u2019re bound to hear more soon enough.

Learn how the long-coming and inevitable shift to electric impacts you.\n \nWhether you want to build your own home theater or just learn more about TVs, displays, projectors, and more, we've got you covered.\n \nGet tech's top stories in 30 seconds:\n \nSATA (pronounced say-da), short for Serial ATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment), is an IDE standard first released in 2001 for connecting devices like optical drives and hard drives to the motherboard.\n \nThe term SATA generally refers to the types of cables and connections that follow this standard.\n \nSerial ATA replaces Parallel ATA as the IDE standard of choice for connecting storage devices inside of a computer. SATA storage devices can transmit data to and from the rest of the computer much, much faster than an otherwise similar PATA device.\n PATA is sometimes just called IDE. If you see SATA being used sort of as an opposite term with IDE, it just means that Serial and Parallel ATA cables or connections are being discussed. \nCompared to Parallel ATA, Serial ATA also has the benefit of cheaper cable costs and the ability to hot-swap devices. To hot-swap means that the devices can be replaced without turning off the entire system. With PATA devices, you have to shut off the computer before replacing the hard drive.\n While SATA drives support hot-swapping, the device using it must as well, like the operating system. \nSATA cables themselves are much smaller than the fat PATA ribbon cables. This means that they're easier to manage because they don't take up as much space and can be tied up more easily if need be. The thinner design also results in better airflow inside the computer case.\n \nLike you read above, SATA transfer speeds are much higher than PATA. 133 MB/s is the fastest transfer speed possible with PATA devices, whereas SATA supports speeds of around 600 MB/s (as of revision 3.4).\n \nThe maximum cable length of a PATA cable is just 18 inches (1.5 feet). SATA cables can be as long as 1 meter (3.3 feet), which provides some freedom to choose where devices can be mounted. However, while a PATA data cable can have two devices attached to it at once, a SATA cable allows just one.\n \nSome Windows operating systems don't support SATA devices, like Windows 95 and 98. However, since those versions of Windows are so outdated, it shouldn't be a concern these days.\n \nAnother disadvantage of SATA hard drives is that they sometimes require a special device driver before the computer can begin reading data from it and writing data to it.\n \nSATA cables are long, 7-pin cables. Both ends are flat and thin, with one often made at a 90-degree angle for better cable management. One end plugs into a port on the motherboard, usually labeled SATA, and the other (such as the angled end) into the back of a storage device like a SATA hard drive.\n \nExternal hard drives can also be used with SATA connections, given, of course, that the hard drive itself has a SATA connection, too. This is called external SATA, or eSATA. The way it works is that the external drive attaches to the eSATA connection at the back of the computer next to the other openings for things like the monitor, network cable, and USB ports. Inside the computer, the same internal SATA connection is made with the motherboard just as if the hard drive were fixed inside the case.\n \neSATA drives are hot-swappable in the same way as internal SATA drives.\n Most computers don't come pre-installed with an eSATA connection on the back of the case. However, you can buy the bracket yourself pretty cheaply. StarTech's 1 Port SATA to eSATA Slot Plate Bracket, for example, is around $10. \nHowever, one caveat with external SATA hard drives is that the cable doesn't transfer power, only data. This means that unlike some external USB drives, eSATA drives require a power adapter, like one that plugs into the wall.\n \nThere are various adapters you can purchase if you need to convert an older cable type to SATA or convert SATA to some other connection type.\n \nFor example, if you want to use your SATA hard drive through a USB connection, like to wipe the drive, browse through the data, or back up the files, you can buy a SATA to USB adapter. Through Amazon, you can get something like this SATA/PATA/IDE Drive to USB Adapter Converter Cable for just that purpose.\n \nThere are also Molex converters you can use if your power supply doesn't provide the 15-pin cable connection that you need to power your internal SATA hard drive. Those cable adapters are pretty inexpensive, like this one from Micro SATA Cables.\n \nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day \nHit Refresh on Your Tech News"], "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv6dA8csbIM": [""], "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il0S8BoucSA": [""], "https://www.javatpoint.com/sata-vs-pata": [" SATA stands for Serial ATA, and PATA stands for Parallel ATA. They both refer to two different methods of encoding and transporting data electronically. The data transfer speed of SATA is higher than that of PATA. Unlike PATA devices, all SATA devices have the 'Hot Swap\" feature. They also differ in the physical layout of both connectors and other hardware. SATA stands for serial ATA. It is a computer bus interface that connects the bus adapters to the storage device such as hard disk drives. It has advantages over PATA, such as smaller, and less expensive cables, faster data transfer rates, hot swapping, etc. The SATA devices and host adapters communicate through the high-speed serial cable over the conductors. Because it utilises Primary ATA and the ATAPI command group like legacy ATA devices, it is backwards compatible. SATA brought a major change in computer hardware where it replaced Parallel ATA in customer desktop and laptop computers and in newer embedded applications. The primary STA connector contains seven pins, two twister pairs, and three ground wires. With clock frequencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.0, differential transmission is used. The more recent SATA version additionally offers isochronous transmission capabilities for audio and video devices. An improved technique, known as AHCI, is incorporated in SATA to enable hot plug and (NCQ) Native Command Queuing (Advances Host Controller Interface). The following are the advantages of SATA over PATA: Increased Data Transfer Rate The faster data transfer speeds offered by SATA are the main reason it is preferred to PATA. PATA can transfer data at speeds of 66, 100, and 133 MB/s while SATA can do so at 150/300/600 MBs/second. The numerous PATA and SATA flavours, with the fastest speeds being the most recent versions of each now offered, are what cause the speed disparities. We will observe that even its at lowest speed, SATA is still faster than PATA, Programs can load more quickly thanks to SATA's increased speed, and larger documents can open more quickly too. Faster data transfer rates can result in improved gaming experiences for fans of video games (i.e., smoother game-play). Support For More Drives Multiple SATA hard drives can be connected together thanks to the four to six SATA connections on a motherboard. On a typical computer motherboard, only two PATA connections can accommodate up to four PATA hard drives. Increased Airflow Because SATA cables are thinner than PATA cables, there is more ventilation inside the computer casing and less heat build-up. A computer's overall life can be extended with better airflow. Easy Cable Management and Cable Length The length of the cable connecting the hard drive to the motherboard of the computer is another benefit of SATA over PATA. The PATA cable can be as long as 18-inches, but a SATA cable can be as long as 3.3 feet (1 metres). This additional length gives us more options for where to attach a hard disc within a computer casing. The following are the disadvantages of SATA of over PATA: One Drive Per Cable Another drawback of SATA is that only one SATA hard drive may be connected at a time using the cable. A PATA cable, however, enables the connection of two PATA hard drives per cable. Drivers and Support Only a few minor drawbacks of SATA over PATA exist; one drawback is that SATA hard drives occasionally need a unique device driver for the computer to detect and use the drive. The specific driver does not have to be loaded because a SATA hard drive can function as a PATA hard drive. However, in order to acquire these mimic capabilities, certain SATA functionality is lost. SATA drives are not supported by the older operating systems like Windows 95 and 98, developed many years before SATA was first offered. PATA (Parallel ATA) is the latter version of ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment) and the former version of SATA. As was already, the interface standard for connecting storage devices is these AT attachments (hard disks, floppy drives and optical disks). X3/INCITS committee maintains the standard and uses AT attachment (ATA) and AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAP) standards. The PATA standard is the result of a gradual evolution that began with the original AT attachment interface used in earlier PC AT devices. The original ATA is now known as PATA with the development of the SATA. In PATA, the cable's maximum length is 18 inches (457.2 mm). Only the internal computer storage interface can use PATA cables because of their limited length. The PATA utilises a 16-bit wide data bus in addition to additional support and control signals. It operates at a low frequency and is connected to the ribbon cable by 40-pin connectors. Every cable contains two or three connectors, one of which is connected to the interface adapter, and the other two are plugged into drives. Among SATA and PATA, Serial-ATA has a number of advantages over Parallel-ATA, including quick data transfer and a cable and connector that is smaller than the enormous 40-pin connector.

At a trial last month, Sheeran and his Shape of You co-writers, Snow Patrol\u2019s John McDaid and producer Steve McCutcheon, faced accusations that they had ripped off the 2015 song Oh Why by Sami Chokri and Ross O\u2019Donoghue. Over the course of 11 days, Sheeran \u2013 one of world\u2019s biggest musicians, who has maintained a firm grip over pop for close to a decade with an array of chart topping hits \u2013 took the stand to defend himself against allegations that he had a habit of copying the work of other artists without giving them due credit. But on Wednesday, he was vindicated after Mr Justice Zacaroli concluded that Sheeran \u201cneither deliberately nor subconsciously\u201d copied a phrase from Oh Why. The judge said that while there were \u201csimilarities\u201d between the one-bar phrase that repeats the words \u201cOh why\u201d in Chokri\u2019s song and the repetition of \u201cOh I\u201d in Sheeran\u2019s, such similarities are \u201conly a starting point\u201d for a copyright infringement claim, and there are also \u201csignificant differences\u201d between the phrases in the songs. In a video on Instagram shared with his 37.7 million followers after the ruing, Sheeran condemned a growing culture of unwarranted copyright claims. \u201cClaims like this are way too common now and have become a culture where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there is no basis for the claim, and it\u2019s really damaging to the songwriting industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music and coincidences are bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released a day on Spotify, that is 22m songs a year, and there are only 12 notes that are available.\u201d The singer said he did not want to \u201ctake anything away from the pain and hurt suffered from both sides of this case but I just want to say I\u2019m not an entity, I\u2019m not a corporation, I\u2019m a human being, I\u2019m a father, I\u2019m a husband, I\u2019m a son. \u201cLawsuits are not a pleasant experience and I hope with this ruling it means in the future baseless claims like this can be avoided. This really does have to end.\u201d A further joint statement with co-writers McDaid and McCutcheon emphasised that all three respected and acknowledged the music of their influences and collaborators, no matter \u201chow successful something appears to be\u201d. They said the case had come at a cost to \u201ccreativity\u201d and their mental health. \u201cWhen we are tangled up in lawsuits, we are not making music or playing shows. There is an impact on both us and the wider circle of songwriters everywhere.\u201d Chokri, a grime artist who performs under the name Sami Switch, and his co-writer Ross O\u2019Donoghue had claimed the \u201cOh I\u201d hook in Shape of You was \u201cstrikingly similar\u201d to the \u201cOh why\u201d refrain in their track. Legal proceedings began in May 2018, with Sheeran and his co-writers asking the high court to declare they had not infringed Chokri and O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s copyright. Sheeran also said his reputation had been sullied by the allegations. Two months later, Chokri and O\u2019Donoghue issued their own claim for \u201ccopyright infringement, damages and an account of profits in relation to the alleged infringement\u201d. Both parties anticipated costs in the region of \u00a33m between them. The judge dismissed Chokri\u2019s counterclaim on Wednesday and granted a declaration to Sheeran and his co-writers that they had not infringed the copyright in Oh Why. He added: \u201cAs for Mr Sheeran, the justification for declaratory relief was only increased by the fact that although the case only relates to Shape [of You], it was pursued against him on a basis \u2013 which I reject \u2013 that he is a \u2018magpie\u2019 who habitually deliberately copies and conceals the work of other songwriters.\u201d During the trial, Sheeran frequently burst into song and hummed musical scales and melodies from Blackstreet\u2019s No Diggity and Nina Simone\u2019s classic Feeling Good to demonstrate how common the melody that Shape of You uses is. He said it uses \u201ca basic minor pentatonic pattern\u201d which is \u201centirely commonplace\u201d. The singer has already given the writers behind TLC\u2019s 90s hit No Scrubs a credit on Shape of You after comparisons were made between the two songs. Ian Mill QC, representing the Shape of You writers, said the legal battle had been \u201cdeeply traumatising\u201d, arguing the case should never have reached trial. The Oh Why co-writers\u2019 lawyer, Andrew Sutcliffe QC, alleged that Sheeran\u2019s lawyers brought the legal proceedings because PRS for Music \u2013 the industry body that collects and distributes royalties \u2013 had \u201cfrozen\u201d any royalties from the performances or broadcasts of Shape of You. He said the case was not about \u201chow famous the claimants are, it boils down to that the defendants are not \u2026 Shaggy, Coldplay, Rihanna or Jay-Z. If they were, they would have been treated in a very different way\u201d. Sheeran, it was alleged, was targeted with a \u201cconcerted plan\u201d by Chokri\u2019s former management to secure his interest in the singer, with Oh Why being sent to those around the star, including the late SBTV founder Jamal Edwards. Chokri told the trial he felt \u201crobbed\u201d by the music star and was left shocked when he first heard Shape Of You on the radio. But the judge said on Wednesday that the evidence \u201cprovides no more than a speculative foundation\u201d for Sheeran having heard Oh Why. Shape of You, which Sheeran said he had originally envisaged being performed by Rihanna or Little Mix, was a worldwide hit, becoming the bestselling song of 2017 in the UK."], "https://www.xtremegaminerd.com/how-to-identify-sata-1-2-3/": [" SATA connects your storage drive to the motherboard and is the most common interface for connecting storage drives to the computer. SATA has continuously evolved over the past two decades and you might want to know what SATA version or Port you have on your motherboard if you are looking to add a storage drive to your computer. While different versions of SATA ports may look similar, they are not exactly the same. Also, it sometimes matters to choose the correct SATA port for fast boot and compatibility with your chipset. SATA\u00a0A.K.A\u00a0Serial AT Attachment is developed by Serial ATA International Organization which is a non-profit organization previously known as\u00a0Serial ATA Working Group. SATA was developed in 2003 as a computer bus interface to connect host bus adapters such as motherboards to storage devices such as hard drives and solid-state drives.  With the launch, SATA replaced the PATA or Parallel AT Attachment which was the common interface to connect storage drives to motherboards before 2003. Due to being significantly faster and smaller in size, SATA soon became the standard and has evolved over two times in the last two decades. SATA has three different versions. Each SATA version has different bandwidth but they all look identical. SATA I has a running speed of 1.5Gb/s, SATA II has 3Gb/s, and SATA III has 6Gb/s. SATA II is the latest version of SATA and is the fastest of all. Modern storage drives such as Solid State Drives generally operate at a sequential Read/Write speed of ~500MB/s and are best with SATA III ports. While the SATA ports are backward compatible, meaning you can use SATA III storage drives with previous SATA versions, the transfer speed of storage drives will be bottlenecked. However, the reverse is not true. SATA I drives will operate at full speed with SATA II and SATA III ports. Most motherboards have SATA ports between 4 to 8. Smaller motherboards tend to have 4 SATA ports while higher-end motherboards feature 6 or 8 SATA ports. To know how many SATA ports you have, you can use four methods. Physical inspection requires taking the motherboard in your hand or looking at it inside the computer chassis. You can simply open your PC case if you want to know how many SATA ports your motherboard has. Make sure you power off your computer before you touch your system. Click to enlarge Most motherboards have SATA ports either at the side or bottom on the right edge of the PCB. SATA ports are generally grouped together in one place but some motherboards may have a few SATA ports at one place and a few at another. Motherboards can have SATA ports aligned vertically on the PCB with their interface facing upwards and some may have the interface facing at the side. Some may have both types of alignment to ease the cable connection. Motherboard manufacturers have dedicated product pages on their websites. If you want to know how many SATA ports you have on your motherboard without opening up the chassis, you can search for your motherboard model on Google or by going straight to the manufacturer\u2019s site.  Motherboards have dedicated pages for specs, features, and support. Head to the Specs page and in front of the storage interface, you will find the number of SATA ports you have on your motherboard along with the version of the SATA port. Under the Support page on the manufacturer\u2019s website or the box in which your motherboard came, you will find a motherboard manual that has detailed labeling of each and every component.  Not only does the motherboard manual come with a detailed specs sheet but it also has several diagrams that show exactly where each component is situated on that particular motherboard. Third-party tools can detect your PC hardware. They give you a detailed specs sheet of each component whether it is a motherboard, graphics card, CPU, or RAM. I recommend using HWiNFO for finding out the number and versions of SATA ports your motherboard has. It is an advanced tool where you need to navigate through different options to know about your SATA ports and other hardware. If you want to know how many SATA ports your motherboard has,  -> Simply expand the \u201cMotherboard\u201d -> Expand \u201cSMBIOS DMI\u201d -> Expand \u201cPort Connectors\u201d and from here you can count how many times SATA appears. However, this doesn\u2019t tell you which version of SATA ports they are. To know the versions,  -> Expand \u201cDrives\u201d -> Expand \u201c(S)ATA/ATAPI Drives\u201d -> Click on your desired storage drive and you can find all the information about the SATA port to which your SATA drive is connected. SATA I, II, and III are different from SATA 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. SATA 1, 2, 3, and 4 are SATA port labeling and they can be located on the motherboard itself. Just as you can find how many SATA ports your motherboard has, you also identify the labeling of each SATA port. Most motherboards have SATA port labeling near the SATA ports. They can be either under, over, or at the side of the SATA ports.  Labeling of SATA ports doesn\u2019t start with SATA 1, but with SATA 0. Therefore the numbering will be followed from 0 and not from 1. For example, if a motherboard has four SATA ports, they will be labeled as- Motherboard manufacturers list these port labels on the specs sheet where the bandwidth and operating condition of each port are explained. Motherboards that have several SATA ports, M.2 connectors, and multiple PCI slots can have restrictions on using the last two SATA ports that depend on the usage of M.2 connectors and PCI slots controlled by the chipset. SATA I, II, and III generally utilize the same SATA cable for connection but the electrical shielding on the SATA 3 cable is much better.  Also,\u00a0 SATA III cables have a latch at the connector to avoid a loose connection. This eliminates the problem of the SATA connector coming out with an accidental touch. SATA I and SATA II connectors usually have this loose connection problem although the operational difference between these cables is negligible. We have explained each type of SATA and how to find them on your motherboard with an easy-to-follow guide.

Serial ATA succeeded the earlier Parallel ATA (PATA) standard to become the predominant interface for storage devices.\n Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from the Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO) which are then promulgated by the INCITS Technical Committee T13, AT Attachment (INCITS T13).[4]\n SATA was announced in 2000[5][6] in order to provide several advantages over the earlier PATA interface such as reduced cable size and cost (seven conductors instead of 40 or 80), native hot swapping, faster data transfer through higher signaling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional) I/O queuing protocol. Revision 1.0 of the specification was released in January 2003.[3]\n Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from the Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO). The SATA-IO group collaboratively creates, reviews, ratifies, and publishes the interoperability specifications, the test cases and plugfests. As with many other industry compatibility standards, the SATA content ownership is transferred to other industry bodies: primarily INCITS T13[4] and an INCITS T10 subcommittee (SCSI), a subgroup of T10 responsible for Serial Attached SCSI (SAS). The remainder of this article strives to use the SATA-IO terminology and specifications.\n Before SATA's introduction in 2000, PATA was simply known as ATA. The \"AT Attachment\" (ATA) name originated after the 1984 release of the IBM Personal Computer AT, more commonly known as the IBM AT.[7] The IBM AT's controller interface became a de facto industry interface for the inclusion of hard disks. \"AT\" was IBM's abbreviation for \"Advanced Technology\"; thus, many companies and organizations indicate SATA is an abbreviation of \"Serial Advanced Technology Attachment\". However, the ATA specifications simply use the name \"AT Attachment\", to avoid possible trademark issues with IBM.[8]\n SATA host adapters and devices communicate via a high-speed serial cable over two pairs of conductors. In contrast, parallel ATA (the redesignation for the legacy ATA specifications) uses a 16-bit wide data bus with many additional support and control signals, all operating at a much lower frequency. To ensure backward compatibility with legacy ATA software and applications, SATA uses the same basic ATA and ATAPI command sets as legacy ATA devices.\n The world's first SATA hard disk drive is the Seagate Barracuda SATA V, which was released in Jan 2003.[9]\n SATA has replaced parallel ATA in consumer desktop and laptop computers; SATA's market share in the desktop PC market was 99% in 2008.[10] PATA has mostly been replaced by SATA for any use; with PATA in declining use in industrial and embedded applications that use CompactFlash (CF) storage, which was designed around the legacy PATA standard. A 2008 standard, CFast, to replace CompactFlash is based on SATA.[11][12]\n The Serial ATA spec requires SATA devices be capable of hot plugging; that is, devices that meet the specification are capable of insertion or removal of a device into or from a backplane connector (combined signal and power) that has power on. After insertion, the device initializes and then operates normally. Depending upon the operating system, the host may also initialize, resulting in a hot swap. The powered host and device do not need to be in an idle state for safe insertion and removal, although unwritten data may be lost when power is removed.\n Unlike PATA, both SATA and eSATA support hot plugging by design. However, this feature requires proper support at the host, device (drive), and operating-system levels. In general, SATA devices fulfill the device-side hot-plugging requirements, and most SATA host adapters support this function.[2]\n For eSATA, hot plugging is supported in AHCI mode only. IDE mode does not support hot plugging.[13]\n Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) is an open host controller interface published and used by Intel, which has become a de facto standard. It allows the use of advanced features of SATA such as hotplug and native command queuing (NCQ). If AHCI is not enabled by the motherboard and chipset, SATA controllers typically operate in \"IDE[b] emulation\" mode, which does not allow access to device features not supported by the ATA (also called IDE) standard.\n Windows device drivers that are labeled as SATA are often running in IDE emulation mode unless they explicitly state that they are AHCI mode, in RAID mode, or a mode provided by a proprietary driver and command set that allowed access to SATA's advanced features before AHCI became popular. Modern versions of Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Linux with version 2.6.19 onward,[14] as well as Solaris and OpenSolaris, include support for AHCI, but earlier operating systems such as Windows XP do not. Even in those instances, a proprietary driver may have been created for a specific chipset, such as Intel's.[15]\n SATA revisions are typically designated with a dash followed by Roman numerals, e.g. \"SATA-III\",[16] to avoid confusion with the speed, which is always displayed in Arabic numerals, e.g. \"SATA 6 Gbit/s\". The speeds given are the raw interface rate in Gbit/s including line code overhead, and the usable data rate in MB/s without overhead.\n Revision 1.0a[3] was released on January 7, 2003. First-generation SATA interfaces, now known as SATA 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s, communicate at a rate of 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s,[c] and do not support Native Command Queuing (NCQ). Taking 8b/10b encoding overhead into account, they have an actual uncoded transfer rate of 1.2\u00a0Gbit/s (150\u00a0MB/s). The theoretical burst throughput of SATA 1.5 Gbit/s is similar to that of PATA/133, but newer SATA devices offer enhancements such as NCQ, which improve performance in a multitasking environment.\n During the initial period after SATA 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s finalization, adapter and drive manufacturers used a \"bridge chip\" to convert existing PATA designs for use with the SATA interface. Bridged drives have a SATA connector, may include either or both kinds of power connectors, and, in general, perform identically to their native-SATA equivalents.[17] However, most bridged drives lack support for some SATA-specific features such as NCQ. Native SATA products quickly took over the bridged products with the introduction of the second generation of SATA drives.[citation needed]\n As of April\u00a02010[update], the fastest 10,000\u00a0rpm SATA hard disk drives could transfer data at maximum (not average) rates of up to 157\u00a0MB/s,[18] which is beyond the capabilities of the older PATA/133 specification and also exceeds the capabilities of SATA 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s.\n SATA revision 2.0 was released in April 2004, introducing Native Command Queuing (NCQ). It is backward compatible with SATA 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s.[19]\n Second-generation SATA interfaces run with a native transfer rate of 3.0\u00a0Gbit/s that, when accounted for the 8b/10b encoding scheme, equals to the maximum uncoded transfer rate of 2.4\u00a0Gbit/s (300\u00a0MB/s). The theoretical burst throughput of the SATA revision 2.0, which is also known as the SATA 3\u00a0Gbit/s, doubles the throughput of SATA revision 1.0.\n All SATA data cables meeting the SATA spec are rated for 3.0\u00a0Gbit/s and handle modern mechanical drives without any loss of sustained and burst data transfer performance. However, high-performance flash-based drives can exceed the SATA 3\u00a0Gbit/s transfer rate; this is addressed with the SATA 6\u00a0Gbit/s interoperability standard.\n Announced in August 2005, SATA revision 2.5 consolidated the specification to a single document.[20][21]\n Announced in February 2007, SATA revision 2.6 introduced the following features:[22]\n Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO) presented the draft specification of SATA 6\u00a0Gbit/s physical layer in July 2008,[23] and ratified its physical layer specification on August 18, 2008.[24] The full 3.0 standard was released on May 27, 2009.[25]\n Third-generation SATA interfaces run with a native transfer rate of 6.0\u00a0Gbit/s; taking 8b/10b encoding into account, the maximum uncoded transfer rate is 4.8\u00a0Gbit/s (600\u00a0MB/s). The theoretical burst throughput of SATA 6.0\u00a0Gbit/s is double that of SATA revision 2.0. It is backward compatible with SATA 3\u00a0Gbit/s and SATA 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s.[23]\n The SATA\u00a03.0 specification contains the following changes:\n In general, the enhancements are aimed at improving quality of service for video streaming and high-priority interrupts. In addition, the standard continues to support distances up to one meter. The newer speeds may require higher power consumption for supporting chips, though improved process technologies and power management techniques may mitigate this. The later specification can use existing SATA cables and connectors, though it was reported in 2008 that some OEMs were expected to upgrade host connectors for the higher speeds.[26]\n Released in July 2011, SATA revision 3.1 introduced or changed the following features:[27][28]\n Released in August 2013, SATA revision 3.2 introduced the following features:[33]\n Released in February 2016, SATA revision 3.3 introduced the following features:[42][43]\n The new Power Disable feature (similar to the SAS Power Disable feature) uses Pin 3 of the SATA power connector. Some legacy power supplies that provide 3.3 V power on Pin 3 would force drives with Power Disable feature to get stuck in a hard reset condition preventing them from spinning up. The problem can usually be eliminated by using a simple \u201cMolex to SATA\u201d power adaptor to supply power to these drives.[44]\n Released in June 2018, SATA revision 3.4 introduced the following features that enable monitoring of device conditions and execution of housekeeping tasks, both with minimal impact on performance:[45]\n Released in July 2020, SATA revision 3.5 Introduces features that enable increased performance benefits and promote greater integration of SATA devices and products with other industry I/O standards:[46]\n Connectors and cables present the most visible differences between SATA and parallel ATA drives. Unlike PATA, the same connectors are used on 3.5-inch SATA hard disks (for desktop and server computers) and 2.5-inch disks (for portable or small computers).[47]\n Standard SATA connectors for both data and power have a conductor pitch of 1.27\u00a0mm (0.050 inches). Low insertion force is required to mate a SATA connector. A smaller mini-SATA or mSATA connector is used by smaller devices such as 1.8-inch SATA drives, some DVD and Blu-ray drives, and mini SSDs.[48]\n A special eSATA connector is specified for external devices, and an optionally implemented provision for clips to hold internal connectors firmly in place. SATA drives may be plugged into SAS controllers and communicate on the same physical cable as native SAS disks, but SATA controllers cannot handle SAS disks.\n Female SATA ports (on motherboards for example) are for use with SATA data cables that have locks or clips to prevent accidental unplugging. Some SATA cables have right- or left-angled connectors to ease connection to circuit boards.\n The SATA standard defines a data cable with seven conductors (three grounds and four active data lines in two pairs) and 8\u00a0mm wide wafer connectors on each end. SATA cables can have lengths up to 1 metre (3.3\u00a0ft), and connect one motherboard socket to one hard drive. PATA ribbon cables, in comparison, connect one motherboard socket to one or two hard drives, carry either 40 or 80 wires, and are limited to 45 centimetres (18\u00a0in) in length by the PATA specification; however, cables up to 90 centimetres (35\u00a0in) are readily available. Thus, SATA connectors and cables are easier to fit in closed spaces and reduce obstructions to air cooling. Although they are more susceptible to accidental unplugging and breakage than PATA, users can purchase cables that have a locking feature, whereby a small (usually metal) spring holds the plug in the socket.\n SATA connectors may be straight, right-angled, or left-angled. Angled connectors allow lower-profile connections. Right-angled (also called 90-degree) connectors lead the cable immediately away from the drive, on the circuit-board side. Left-angled (also called 270-degree) connectors lead the cable across the drive towards its top.\n One of the problems associated with the transmission of data at high speed over electrical connections is described as noise, which is due to electrical coupling between data circuits and other circuits. As a result, the data circuits can both affect other circuits and be affected by them. Designers use a number of techniques to reduce the undesirable effects of such unintentional coupling. One such technique used in SATA links is differential signaling. This is an enhancement over PATA, which uses single-ended signaling. The use of fully shielded, dual coax conductors, with multiple ground connections, for each differential pair[50] improves isolation between the channels and reduces the chances of lost data in difficult electrical environments.\n A seven-pin SATA data cable (left-angled version of the connector)\n SATA connector on a 3.5-inch hard drive, with data pins on the left and power pins on the right. The two different pin lengths ensure a specific mating order; the longer lengths are ground pins and make contact first.\n SATA\u00a03.0 (6\u00a0Gbit/s) cable showing the two foil shielded differential pairs.\n SATA specifies a different power connector than the four-pin Molex connector used on Parallel ATA (PATA) devices (and earlier small storage devices, going back to ST-506 hard disk drives and even to floppy disk drives that predated the IBM PC). It is a wafer-type connector, like the SATA data connector, but much wider (fifteen pins versus seven) to avoid confusion between the two. Some early SATA drives included the four-pin Molex power connector together with the new fifteen-pin connector, but most SATA drives now have only the latter.\n The new SATA power connector contains many more pins for several reasons:[51]\n Passive adapters are available that convert a four-pin Molex connector to a SATA power connector, providing the 5\u00a0V and 12\u00a0V lines available on the Molex connector, but not 3.3\u00a0V. There are also four-pin Molex-to-SATA power adapters that include electronics to additionally provide the 3.3\u00a0V power supply.[52] However, most drives do not require the 3.3\u00a0V power line.[53]\n SATA\u00a02.6 is the first revision that defined the slimline connector, intended for smaller form-factors such as notebook optical drives. Pin 1 of the slimline power connector, denoting device presence, is shorter than the others to allow hot-swapping.  The slimline signal connector is identical and compatible with the standard version, while the power connector is reduced to six pins so it supplies only +5\u00a0V, and not +12\u00a0V or +3.3\u00a0V.[22][54]\n Low-cost adapters exist to convert from standard SATA to slimline SATA.\n A six-pin slimline SATA power connector\n The back of a SATA-based slimline optical drive\n The micro SATA connector (sometimes called uSATA or \u03bcSATA[55]) originated with SATA\u00a02.6, and is intended for 1.8-inch hard disk drives. There is also a micro data connector, similar in appearance but slightly thinner than the standard data connector.\n SATA drives, in particular mechanical ones, come with an extra 4 or more pin interface which isn't uniformly standardised but nevertheless serves similar purpose defined by each drive manufacturer. As IDE drives used those extra pins for setting up Master and Slave drives, on SATA drives, those pins are generally used to select different Power modes for use in USB-SATA bridges or enables additional features like Spread Spectrum Clocking, SATA Speed Limit or Factory Mode for Diagnostics and Recovery, by the use of a jumper.[56][57]\n Standardized in 2004, eSATA (e standing for external) provides a variant of SATA meant for external connectivity.  It uses a more robust connector, longer shielded cables, and stricter (but backward-compatible) electrical standards.  The protocol and logical signaling (link/transport layers and above) are identical to internal SATA.  The differences are:\n Aimed at the consumer market, eSATA enters an external storage market served also by the USB and FireWire interfaces. The SATA interface has certain advantages. Most external hard-disk-drive cases with FireWire or USB interfaces use either PATA or SATA drives and \"bridges\" to translate between the drives' interfaces and the enclosures' external ports; this bridging incurs some inefficiency. Some single disks can transfer 157\u00a0MB/s during real use,[18] about four times the maximum transfer rate of USB 2.0 or FireWire 400 (IEEE 1394a) and almost twice as fast as the maximum transfer rate of FireWire 800. The S3200 FireWire 1394b specification reaches around 400\u00a0MB/s (3.2\u00a0Gbit/s), and USB 3.0 has a nominal speed of 5\u00a0Gbit/s. Some low-level drive features, such as S.M.A.R.T., may not operate through some USB[58] or FireWire or USB+FireWire bridges; eSATA does not suffer from these issues provided that the controller manufacturer (and its drivers) presents eSATA drives as ATA devices, rather than as SCSI devices, as has been common with Silicon Image, JMicron, and NVIDIA nForce drivers for Windows Vista. In those cases SATA drives do not have low-level features accessible.\n The eSATA version of SATA\u00a06G operates at 6.0\u00a0Gbit/s (the term \"SATA\u00a0III\" is avoided by the SATA-IO organization to prevent confusion with SATA\u00a0II 3.0\u00a0Gbit/s, which was colloquially referred to as \"SATA\u00a03G\" [bit/s] or \"SATA\u00a0300\" [MB/s] since the 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s SATA\u00a0I and 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s SATA\u00a0II were referred to as both \"SATA\u00a01.5G\" [bit/s] or \"SATA\u00a0150\" [MB/s]). Therefore, eSATA connections operate with negligible differences between them.[59] Once an interface can transfer data as fast as a drive can handle them, increasing the interface speed does not improve data transfer.\n There are some disadvantages, however, to the eSATA interface:\n As of mid 2017 few new computers have dedicated external SATA (eSATA) connectors, with USB3 dominating and USB3 Type C, often with the Thunderbolt alternate mode, starting to replace the earlier USB connectors. Still sometimes present are single ports supporting both USB3 and eSATA.\n Desktop computers without a built-in eSATA interface can install an eSATA host bus adapter (HBA); if the motherboard supports SATA, an externally available eSATA connector can be added. Notebook computers with the now rare Cardbus[61] or ExpressCard[62] could add an eSATA HBA. With passive adapters, the maximum cable length is reduced to 1 metre (3.3\u00a0ft) due to the absence of compliant eSATA signal-levels.\n eSATAp stands for powered eSATA. It is also known as Power over eSATA, Power eSATA, eSATA/USB Combo, or eSATA USB Hybrid Port (EUHP). An eSATAp port combines the four pins of the USB\u00a02.0 (or earlier) port, the seven pins of the eSATA port, and optionally two 12\u00a0V power pins.[63] Both SATA traffic and device power are integrated in a single cable, as is the case with USB but not eSATA. The 5\u00a0V power is provided through two USB pins, while the 12\u00a0V power may optionally be provided. Typically desktop, but not notebook, computers provide 12\u00a0V power, so can power devices requiring this voltage, typically 3.5-inch disk and CD/DVD drives, in addition to 5\u00a0V devices such as 2.5-inch drives.\n Both USB and eSATA devices can be used with an eSATAp port, when plugged in with a USB or eSATA cable, respectively. An eSATA device cannot be powered via an eSATAp cable, but a special cable can make both SATA or eSATA and power connectors available from an eSATAp port.\n An eSATAp connector can be built into a computer with internal SATA and USB, by fitting a bracket with connections for internal SATA, USB, and power connectors and an externally accessible eSATAp port. Though eSATAp connectors have been built into several devices, manufacturers do not refer to an official standard.\n Mini-SATA (abbreviated as mSATA), which is distinct from the micro connector,[55] was announced by the Serial ATA International Organization on September 21, 2009.[65]  Applications include netbooks, laptops and other devices that require a solid-state drive in a small footprint.\n The physical dimensions of the mSATA connector are identical to those of the PCI Express Mini Card interface,[66] but the interfaces are electrically incompatible; the data signals (TX\u00b1/RX\u00b1 SATA, PETn0 PETp0 PERn0 PERp0 PCI Express) need a connection to the SATA host controller instead of the PCI Express host controller.\n The M.2 specification has superseded both mSATA and mini-PCIe.[67]\n Slim 2.5-inch SATA devices, 5\u00a0mm (0.20 inches) in height, use the twenty-pin SFF-8784 edge connector to save space.  By combining the data signals and power lines into a slim connector that effectively enables direct connection to the device's printed circuit board (PCB) without additional space-consuming connectors, SFF-8784 allows further internal layout compaction for portable devices such as ultrabooks.[68]\n Pins 1 to 10 are on the connector's bottom side, while pins 11 to 20 are on the top side.[68]\n SATA Express, initially standardized in the SATA 3.2 specification,[69] is an interface that supports either SATA or PCI Express storage devices.  The host connector is backward compatible with the standard 3.5-inch SATA data connector, allowing up to two legacy SATA devices to connect.[70]  At the same time, the host connector provides up to two PCI Express\u00a03.0 lanes as a pure PCI Express connection to the storage device, allowing bandwidths of up to 2\u00a0GB/s.[33][71]\n Instead of the otherwise usual approach of doubling the native speed of the SATA interface, PCI Express was selected for achieving data transfer speeds greater than 6\u00a0Gbit/s.  It was concluded that doubling the native SATA speed would take too much time, too many changes would be required to the SATA standard, and would result in a much greater power consumption when compared to the existing PCI Express bus.[72]\n In addition to supporting legacy Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI), SATA Express also makes it possible for NVM Express (NVMe) to be used as the logical device interface for connected PCI Express storage devices.[73]\n As M.2 form factor, described below, achieved much larger popularity, SATA Express is considered as a failed standard and dedicated ports quickly disappeared from motherboards.\n M.2, formerly known as the Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF), is a specification for computer expansion cards and associated connectors.  It replaces the mSATA standard, which uses the PCI Express Mini Card physical layout.  Having a smaller and more flexible physical specification, together with more advanced features, the M.2 is more suitable for solid-state storage applications in general, especially when used in small devices such as ultrabooks or tablets.[74]\n The M.2 standard is designed as a revision and improvement to the mSATA standard, so that larger printed circuit boards (PCBs) can be manufactured.  While mSATA took advantage of the existing PCI Express Mini Card form factor and connector, M.2 has been designed to maximize usage of the card space, while minimizing the footprint.[74][75][76]\n Supported host controller interfaces and internally provided ports are a superset to those defined by the SATA Express interface.  Essentially, the M.2 standard is a small form factor implementation of the SATA Express interface, with the addition of an internal USB\u00a03.0 port.[74]\n U.2, formerly known as SFF-8639. Like M.2, it carries a PCI Express electrical signal, however U.2 uses a PCIe 3.0 \u00d74 link providing a higher bandwidth of 32\u00a0Gbit/s in each direction. In order to provide maximum backward compatibility the U.2 connector also supports SATA and multi-path SAS.[77]\n The SATA specification defines three distinct protocol layers: physical, link, and transport.\n The physical layer defines SATA's electrical and physical characteristics (such as cable dimensions and parasitics, driver voltage level and receiver operating range), as well as the physical coding subsystem (bit-level encoding, device detection on the wire, and link initialization).\n Physical transmission uses differential signaling. The SATA PHY contains a transmit pair and receive pair. When the SATA-link is not in use (example: no device attached), the transmitter allows the transmit pins to float to their common-mode voltage level. When the SATA-link is either active or in the link-initialization phase, the transmitter drives the transmit pins at the specified differential voltage (1.5\u00a0V in SATA/I).\n SATA physical coding uses a line encoding system known as 8b/10b encoding. This scheme serves multiple functions required to sustain a differential serial link. First, the stream contains necessary synchronization information that allows the SATA host/drive to extract clocking. The 8b/10b encoded sequence embeds periodic edge transitions to allow the receiver to achieve bit-alignment without the use of a separately transmitted reference clock waveform. The sequence also maintains a neutral (DC-balanced) bitstream, which lets transmit drivers and receiver inputs be AC-coupled. Generally, the actual SATA signalling is half-duplex, meaning that it can only read or write data at any one time.\n Also, SATA uses some of the special characters defined in 8b/10b. In particular, the PHY layer uses the comma (K28.5) character to maintain symbol-alignment. A specific four-symbol sequence, the ALIGN primitive, is used for clock rate-matching between the two devices on the link. Other special symbols communicate flow control information produced and consumed in the higher layers (link and transport).\n Separate point-to-point AC-coupled low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) links are used for physical transmission between host and drive.\n The PHY layer is responsible for detecting the other SATA/device on a cable, and link initialization. During the link-initialization process, the PHY is responsible for locally generating special out-of-band signals by switching the transmitter between electrical-idle and specific 10b-characters in a defined pattern, negotiating a mutually supported signalling rate (1.5, 3.0, or 6.0\u00a0Gbit/s), and finally synchronizing to the far-end device's PHY-layer data stream. During this time, no data is sent from the link-layer.\n Once link-initialization has completed, the link-layer takes over data-transmission, with the PHY providing only the 8b/10b conversion before bit transmission.\n After the PHY-layer has established a link, the link layer is responsible for transmission and reception of Frame Information Structures (FISs) over the SATA link. FISs are packets containing control information or payload data. Each packet contains a header (identifying its type), and payload whose contents are dependent on the type. The link layer also manages flow control over the link.\n Layer number three in the serial ATA specification is the transport layer. This layer has the responsibility of acting on the frames and transmitting/receiving the frames in an appropriate sequence. The transport layer handles the assembly and disassembly of FIS structures, which includes, for example, extracting content from register FISs into the task-file and informing the command layer. In an abstract fashion, the transport layer is responsible for creating and encoding FIS structures requested by the command layer, and removing those structures when the frames are received.\n When DMA data is to be transmitted and is received from the higher command layer, the transport layer appends the FIS control header to the payload, and informs the link layer to prepare for transmission. The same procedure is performed when data is received, but in reverse order. The link layer signals to the transport layer that there is incoming data available. Once the data is processed by the link layer, the transport layer inspects the FIS header and removes it before forwarding the data to the command layer.\n SATA uses a point-to-point architecture. The physical connection between a controller and a storage device is not shared among other controllers and storage devices. SATA defines multipliers, which allows a single SATA controller port to drive up to fifteen storage devices. The multiplier performs the function of a hub; the controller and each storage device is connected to the hub.[78] This is conceptually similar to SAS expanders.\n Modern[update] PC systems have SATA controllers built into the motherboard, typically featuring two to eight ports. Additional ports can be installed through add-in SATA host adapters (available in variety of bus-interfaces: USB, PCI, PCIe).\n At the hardware interface level, SATA and PATA (Parallel AT Attachment) devices are completely incompatible: they cannot be interconnected without an adapter.\n At the application level, SATA devices can be specified to look and act like PATA devices.[79]\n Many motherboards offer a \"Legacy Mode\" option, which makes SATA drives appear to the OS like PATA drives on a standard controller. This Legacy Mode eases OS installation by not requiring that a specific driver be loaded during setup, but sacrifices support for some (vendor specific) features of SATA. Legacy Mode often if not always disables some of the boards' PATA or SATA ports, since the standard PATA controller interface supports only four drives. (Often, which ports are disabled is configurable.)\n The common heritage of the ATA command set has enabled the proliferation of low-cost PATA to SATA bridge chips. Bridge chips were widely used on PATA drives (before the completion of native SATA drives) as well in standalone converters. When attached to a PATA drive, a device-side converter allows the PATA drive to function as a SATA drive. Host-side converters allow a motherboard PATA port to connect to a SATA drive.\n The market has produced powered enclosures for both PATA and SATA drives that interface to the PC through USB, Firewire or eSATA, with the restrictions noted above. PCI cards with a SATA connector exist that allow SATA drives to connect to legacy systems without SATA connectors.\n The designers of SATA standard as an overall goal aimed for backward and forward compatibility with future revisions of the SATA standard. \nTo prevent interoperability problems that could occur when next generation SATA drives are installed on motherboards with standard legacy SATA 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s host controllers, many manufacturers have made it easy to switch those newer drives to the previous standard's mode.\nExamples of such provisions include:\n The \"force 150\" switch (or equivalent) is also useful for attaching SATA 3\u00a0Gbit/s hard drives to SATA controllers on PCI cards, since many of these controllers (such as the Silicon Image chips) run at 3\u00a0Gbit/s, even though the PCI bus cannot reach 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s speeds. This can cause data corruption in operating systems that do not specifically test for this condition and limit the disk transfer speed.[citation needed]\n SATA 3\u00a0Gbit/s and SATA 6\u00a0Gbit/s are compatible with each other. Most devices that are only SATA 3\u00a0Gbit/s can connect with devices that are SATA 6\u00a0Gbit/s, and vice versa, though SATA 3\u00a0Gbit/s devices only connect with SATA 6\u00a0Gbit/s devices at the slower 3\u00a0Gbit/s speed.\n SATA 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s and SATA 6\u00a0Gbit/s are compatible with each other. Most devices that are only SATA 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s can connect with devices that are SATA 6\u00a0Gbit/s, and vice versa, though SATA 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s devices only connect with SATA 6\u00a0Gbit/s devices at the slower 1.5\u00a0Gbit/s speed.\n Parallel SCSI uses a more complex bus than SATA, usually resulting in higher manufacturing costs. SCSI buses also allow connection of several drives on one shared channel, whereas SATA allows one drive per channel, unless using a port multiplier. Serial Attached SCSI uses the same physical interconnects as SATA, and most SAS HBAs also support 3 and 6\u00a0Gbit/s SATA devices (an HBA requires support for Serial ATA Tunneling Protocol).\n SATA 3\u00a0Gbit/s theoretically offers a maximum bandwidth of 300\u00a0MB/s per device, which is only slightly lower than the rated speed for SCSI Ultra 320 with a maximum of 320\u00a0MB/s total for all devices on a bus.[81] SCSI drives provide greater sustained throughput than multiple SATA drives connected via a simple (i.e., command-based) port multiplier because of disconnect-reconnect and aggregating performance.[82] In general, SATA devices link compatibly to SAS enclosures and adapters, whereas SCSI devices cannot be directly connected to a SATA bus.\n SCSI, SAS, and fibre-channel (FC) drives are more expensive than SATA, so they are used in servers and disk arrays where the better performance justifies the additional cost. Inexpensive ATA and SATA drives evolved in the home-computer market, hence there is a view that they are less reliable. As those two worlds overlapped, the subject of reliability became somewhat controversial. Note that, in general, the failure rate of a disk drive is related to the quality of its heads, platters and supporting manufacturing processes, not to its interface.\n Use of serial ATA in the business market increased from 22% in 2006 to 28% in 2008.[10]\n SCSI-3 devices with SCA-2 connectors are designed for hot swapping. Many server and RAID systems provide hardware support for transparent hot swapping. The designers of the SCSI standard prior to SCA-2 connectors did not target hot swapping, but in practice, most RAID implementations support hot swapping of hard disks.\n"], "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mills_High_School": [" \n Thomas Mills High School is a secondary school with academy status as well as a sixth form in Framlingham, Suffolk, England.[1] The current Headteacher is Philip J Hurst.\n The history of the school dates back to the beginning of the 18th century, when local merchant and Baptist philanthropist Thomas Mills stipulated within his will that money from his estate be used to \"further the education of the children in Framlingham\",[2] and as such the Trustees of Mills' estate eventually established the first Mills School in 1751 on Brook Lane, Framlingham. The School was able to survive for one hundred and fifty years, during that time moving from  Brook Lane to Double Street within the town. The School was then combined for several years, starting in 1878, with the Hitcham School in Framlingham, before becoming separate once again in the form of the Mills Grammar School at the turn of the century. The Hitcham School continuing also, eventually becoming the modern Sir Robert Hitcham Primary School in the town. Opening in 1902 as an independent Grammar school for girls aged 8\u201316 with a starting total of only twenty five pupils, Mills Grammar School grew over the course of the 20th century, eventually submitting to local authority control in 1921, changing its age provision to 11\u201318 in 1945 and finally admitting boys to attend the school in the mid-Seventies.\n By this time the traditional model of Grammar, Modern and Technical schools had fallen out of favour and local councils were encouraged to form all-admitting comprehensive schools for the purpose of secondary education. As a result of this Mills Grammar School was merged with Framlingham Modern School, established in 1937, beginning in 1976 under the supervision of latter's Headmaster, Michael Brown. Brown became the first Headmaster of the newly formed Thomas Mills High School opening in 1979, which exists on the site of the old Modern School utilising the already existing buildings and facilities, many of which continues to be used today along with many more modern additions. The original charitable trust established by Mills in his will continues to this day in the form of the Mills Charity,[3] which has maintained a relationship with the school and has regularly been involved and contributed financially to projects within it.[4]\n"], "http://www.thomasmills.suffolk.sch.uk/": [" Skip to content On behalf of everyone at Thomas Mills High School, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the website of the school.\u00a0 We are a flourishing 11-18 high school situated in the pleasant and historic town of Framlingham, Suffolk.\u00a0 We are consistently one of the region's highest performing schools.

This was one of our most highly anticipated software technologies ever, a cutting-edge spatial upscaling solution that delivers amazing performance boosts in supported games (2) on a broad spectrum of hardware. FSR launched with 7 games supporting the technology, and right out of the gate it was praised by both game developers and gamers for being a game-changing upscaling technology. The performance, compatibility, quality, and ease of integration of FSR quickly led to its rapid adoption in games -- within 6 months it became the fastest adopted software gaming tech in AMD history (3), supported in over 70 available and coming soon games by December 2021. Now, following on from the recent release of the first games with AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0, our next-generation temporal upscaling technology, we\u2019ve hit another significant milestone for FSR \u2013 the first anniversary of the technology! And to celebrate we have some exciting announcements to make. To start, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR 1.0 and FSR 2.0) is now available and upcoming in over 110 games! On top of that, we are also releasing the FSR 2.0 API on GPUOpen for game integration by developers. Read on for more details.  One Year of FSR: Key Milestones Let\u2019s have a look at some of the major milestones in the first year of AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution technology, with some of the key dates for both FSR 1.0 and FSR 2.0:  110+ Available and Upcoming Games The adoption rate of AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution has been simply astonishing. From launch in 2021 with just 7 games supporting FSR 1.0, one year later we have an incredible 110+ available and upcoming games supporting both FSR 1.0 and FSR 2.0. For FSR 2.0, we just added five more games to the upcoming list, Abyss World, Hitman 3, Rescue Party: Live!, Super People, and The Callisto Protocol, and now we\u2019ve added three more upcoming games, The Bridge Curse: Road to Salvation, Thymesia, and Tiny Tina\u2019s Wonderlands (update available June 23), bringing the total number of available and upcoming FSR 2.0 games to 22. Looking at FSR 1.0 games, we have so many now that we need two images above and below to fit them all in \u2013 94 games! Also, even though FSR 2.0 is now available in select games, you can still expect to see more games come out with FSR 1.0. Both versions of FSR technology are available for developers and have different characteristics which make them suitable for a wider range of platforms and gamer preferences. As a result, you can look ahead to see some games integrate both FSR 1.0 and FSR 2.0, as seen in DEATHLOOP. Joining our expansive list of available FSR 1.0 games are the enhanced versions of Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3, and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, along with iRacing, a leading online sim racing game. And for the new upcoming FSR 1.0 games, we have Call of the Wild: The Angler\u2122, Lies Of P, PC Building Simulator 2, and Project HP. FSR 2.0 Now Available for Developers Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a proper anniversary for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution if we didn\u2019t also have some amazing news for game developers \u2013 FSR 2.0 is now freely available on GPUOpen for anyone to download. FSR 2.0 is an open-source solution available as an API under the MIT license for ease of integration with complete documentation and full C++ and HLSL source code provided via a library. It supports DirectX\u00ae 12 and Vulkan\u00ae with samples provided for both. In addition, plug-ins for both Unreal\u00ae Engine 4 and 5 are coming soon to make integration as simple as possible for developers that use Unreal. On top of all that, FSR 2.0 is also supported on Xbox and will be available in the Xbox GDK for registered developers to use in their games Its availability as an open-source upscaling solution on GPUOpen, our comprehensive documentation and samples, its ease of use, and the significant performance benefits it delivers to games has allowed FSR to garner the support of a substantial number of game developers and publisher \u2013 110 as of our anniversary, ranging from small indie studios up to the biggest AAA developers. How FSR Stacks Up Against the Competition AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution is an incredible upscaling technology, which has only gotten better with the release of FSR 2.0, our next-level temporal upscaling technology designed to deliver similar or better than native image quality (4). But how does FSR stack up against the competition, such as NVIDIA\u00ae DLSS upscaling technology? Well to start, when you look at FSR as a whole (FSR 1.0 and FSR 2.0) and compare how many games have supported our technology in the first year of its availability, 113 games, and compare that to how many games support DLSS after almost 3.5 years, 180 games, you can easily see that FSR has seen a significantly faster adoption rate by game developers \u2013 2X faster than DLSS since the launch of each technology (5). AMD FIDELITYFX\u2122 SUPER RESOLUTION 2.0 VS. NVIDIA\u00ae DLSS FEATURE AMD FSR 2.0 NVIDIA DLSS Temporal Upscaling Technology \u2714 \u2714 Boosts Framerates in Supported Games \u2714 \u2714 Similar or Better Than Native Image Quality (4) \u2714 \u2714 Includes Optimized Anti-aliasing \u2714 \u2714 Adjustable Image Quality Settings \u2714 \u2714 Easy for Game Developers to Integrate \u2714 \u2714 Open-Source Technology \u2714 \u2718 Doesn\u2019t Require Dedicated Machine Learning (ML) Hardware \u2714 \u2718 Supported Across a Wide Range of Products and Platforms \u2714 \u2718 Console Support \u2714 \u2718 Then when specifically looking at how FSR 2.0 compares to DLSS in the table above, you can easily see that our technology compares extremely favorably to DLSS and is in many ways is superior as it is an open-source technology that doesn\u2019t require ML hardware and is supported across a much wider range of products (6) -- AMD, NVIDIA, and even on consoles. Heading into Year Two of FSR AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution is now about to enter its second year and we\u2019re not taking our foot off the gas! In the coming weeks and months, gamers can expect more of our upcoming FSR 1.0 and FSR 2.0 games to get the technology and expect to see more games announced with support for FSR 2.0. You can also look forward to some of the games that support FSR 1.0 upgrading their support to FSR 2.0, so stay tuned to our news channels for updates. For game developers, our FSR 2.0 plug-ins for Unreal Engine 4 and 5 will soon be available helping make it even easier to integrate FSR 2.0 into an Unreal-based game. And our development of FSR doesn\u2019t just stop at the release of FSR 2.0 on GPUOpen \u2013 \u201csuper resolution\u201d continues to be an area of active research at AMD and we\u2019re looking forward to sharing updates in the near future.
