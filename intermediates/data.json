It\u2019s an upgrade from IEEE 802.11n, or WiFi 4. WiFi 5 was designed to deliver improved speeds, WiFi performance, and better range to keep up with the growing number of users, devices, and data use.  The purpose of WiFi standards  is to improve the wireless local area network (WLAN, SD WAN, or Wireless LAN) user experience. New wireless standards are developed to fill gaps in the existing standards and to account for new technology.  The 4th WiFi generation (IEEE 802.11n) saw a big increase in the number of users and devices using wireless internet. This resulted in speed slowdowns and increased latency. To improve the 802.11n standard, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering developed the IEEE 802.11ac standard from 2008 to 2013. The improvements would result in a better WLAN experience - faster speeds, more bandwidth, and less latency. The updated standard was published in December 2013.  Two waves of products were launched using the 802.11ac standard. The first wave was introduced in 2013 and the second in 2015. The difference between these product waves will be discussed later in this article.  Maximum internet speeds are theoretical. They are based on the best conditions - potential interference is not factored in. 802.11ac has a theoretical maximum speed of 1,300 Mbps (1.3 Gbps) - 2,300 Mbps (2.3 Gbps), but this will depend on real world conditions. It was the first WiFi standard developed that could theoretically achieve gigabit speeds opposed to megabit speeds. In contrast, 802.11n had a theoretical speed of 450 Mbps (0.45 Gbps). This meant WiFi 5 could be up to 3x faster than the earlier WiFi generation under best conditions.  In the real-world, data rates are susceptible to change due to the environment. Obstacles like building material, walls, doors, floors, and furniture can interfere with the signal strength, resulting in the speed slowing down.  Forbes states that the fastest real-world 802.11ac speeds recorded are around 720 Mbps (0.72 Gbps). In contrast, the maximum speed recorded for 802.11n was 240 Mbps (0.24 Gbps). While it\u2019s true that WiFi 5 is 3x faster than WiFi 4, the speeds are much lower than the theoretical ones.  802.11ac built on the features offered by 802.11n to improve throughput, bandwidth, and speed. There are two GHz frequency bands that routers and wireless devices use to communicate with each other \u2013 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Most WiFi devices are dual-band, meaning that they can use both frequency bands. The difference between the two bands is their range, speed, and bandwidth. The 2.4 GHz band provides more coverage but slower speeds. On the other hand, the 5GHz band provides faster speeds but less coverage.  Within those frequency bands, there are smaller bands that stand for WiFi channels. A WiFi channel is what wireless devices use to send and receive data. The width (measured in MHz) dictates how much data can pass through the channel and at what speed. The traditional channel width is 20 MHz, and channel bonding is used to increase the channel widths. Wider channels tend to be associated with more data transfer and faster speeds \u2013 as long as the channel is not crowded and experiencing interferences.  To better explain this, think of a channel as a road. Channel bonding is like adding lanes to it, allowing for more cars and faster overall speed.  The 802.11n standard only supported 20 MHz and 40 MHz channels (bonds two 20 MHz channels). The first 802.11ac product wave supported a maximum of 80 MHz channel bandwidth. To improve on the first wave, the second wave of products took channel width to a different level. Wave 2 supports up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth. The 160 MHz channel improvement was achieved by bonding adjacent channels or non-adjacent 80 MHz channels (to create the 80+80 MHz channel). As a result, it improved throughput significantly.  MIMO technology uses multiple transmitters and receivers (antennas) to send data to multiple WiFi devices simultaneously.  Originally, 802.11n routers used SU-MIMO (Single-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output), meaning that the router could only communicate with one connected device at a time. When 802.11ac Wave 1 was launched, there had not been any improvements done to the SU-MIMO technology. Wave 2 saw these improvements come to light.  Wave 2 802.11ac routers adopted MU-MIMO (Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output). Routers could now send information to multiple devices at the same time. The new technology only supported downlink (communication from the router to wireless devices) MU-MIMO, they could only send data to the client devices simultaneously. The information packets being sent to the wireless router (uplink) could only be sent one by one. This new technology improved speeds and supported more connected devices.  The iUAP-AC-M access point can blanket those hard-to-reach indoor and outdoor areas with reliable WiFi. Don't let WiFi dead spots slow down your business. With MU-MIMO, the iUAP-AC-M access point supports many devices at the same time. Users will experience faster speeds and less lag while working or relaxing.   All routers and wireless devices have antennas, the number of antennas decides the number of spatial streams (data signals) that can be sent and received at the same time. Spatial streams are represented as 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, etc. For example, a 2x2 spatial stream stands for two antennas supporting two data streams.  Both 802.11n and 802.11ac devices had this technology, the difference was the number of spatial streams they supported.  WiFi 4 had a maximum of 4 spatial streams and the first wave of WiFi 5 had 3. How does spatial streaming work if they used Single-User MIMO and could only communicate with one client at a time? Mobile devices can support a certain number of streams. Many smartphones only support 1x1 spatial streams, some higher-end smartphones and laptops support 2x2 spatial streams, some computers support 3x3 spatial streams, and there aren\u2019t many devices that support 4x4 spatial streams.  Let's say you have an 802.11n router with three antennas. This router has three spatial streams, and can only give them to one device at a time. If an iPhone (1x1) and a Mac (2x2) are requesting information at the same time, they will have to stand in line to receive it. The router will use one of its antennas to talk to the iPhone. After finishing with the phone, the router will use two of its antennas to talk to the Mac. Multiple spatial streams can be used to communicate with one client at a time, never with multiple devices. Your three-antenna router wasn\u2019t able to make use of its potential due to only being able to interact with one device at a time.  To help improve the communication process and speeds, 802.11ac Wave 2 routers supported 4 spatial streams (later, up to 8). With the help of Multi-User MIMO, the clients requesting information did not have to wait in line. The router could give one antenna to the iPhone and two to the Mac at the same time. More information could be transmitted and received simultaneously. In addition, since the signal is being given more efficiently, power consumption is reduced which improves the battery life on the connected devices.  Before beamforming was used, the antennas on the routers would send signal in all directions. In a sense, this would cause the signal to go to waste because it was being transmitted into unnecessary areas. Therefore, the wireless signal had less range and was more susceptible to speed slowdowns and interferences. Beamforming is used to improve the wireless signal between the WiFi router and the connected devices. It focuses the signal (known as smart signal) in the direction of the connected devices rather than transmitting it into every direction. Beamforming helps improve the range, speed, and reduce interference.  Beamforming technology existed when 802.11n was developed, but had not yet been standardized. There were lots of different beamforming versions available, but order for beamforming to work the router and the clients needed to share the same beamforming technology. Unfortunately, with so many beamforming versions, not all WiFi 4 manufacturers used the same one.  WiFi 5 standardized explicit beamforming. With the new standards, all manufacturers incorporated the same version. Both waves of WiFi 5 products support what\u2019s called \u201cexplicit\u201d beamforming.  Wireless devices use sound frequencies to communicate with each other. When a device transmits data via sound waves, it modulates the frequency of a specific radio channel. The sound wave is made up of bits of binary code (a series of 0s and 1s). The receiving device decodes the sound waves to understand what is being said. This is how all wireless internet data is transferred.  For example, let\u2019s say you open Google. The transmitting signal modulates the frequency of your radio channel to communicate with the router. The router decodes the 0s and 1s to understand your request. After the information is gathered, the same process will send the information to your computer. When your computer decodes the 0s and 1s, the Google homepage will be displayed on your screen. This process is known as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). WiFi 4 used 64-QAM, meaning that devices sending information could only send 6 bits at a time. The QAM technology was improved for WiFi 5. WiFi 5 uses 256-QAM; it allows devices to send 8 bits of binary code at once. This upgrade improved WiFi speeds by 20% - 33%. Both 802.11ac waves supported 256-QAM. As mentioned earlier, the two frequency bands used to send and receive information are 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. WiFi 4 supported both frequency bands. However, WiFi 5 was developed to only use the 5GHz frequency. This would reduce the amount of interferences within the 2.4 GHz frequency. Signal interference is caused by multiple devices working under the same frequency. There are a variety of devices that use the 2.4 GHz band - Bluetooth headsets, microwaves, baby monitors, home phones, etc. All of these clog up the band, slowing data. Most of us have experienced this.  In order to use the 2.4 GHz band, WiFi 4 technology had to be incorporated into the development of WiFi 5.  WiFi 5 devices using the 5GHz frequency can take full advantage of all the features offered by the new WiFi upgrade. But, WiFi 5 devices using the 2.4 GHz frequency can only tap into the WiFi 4 technology.  The following chart is an overview of the two types of 802.11ac compatible products:  For more information visit Cisco's white paper, 802.11ac: The Fifth Generation of WiFi. The following chart is an overview of the differences between the 802.11ac and 802.11n standards: Short answer: Yes. Backward compatibility is possible due to WiFi 5 using 802.11n technology to tap into the 2.4 GHz frequency. If WiFi 5 devices were only able to use the 5 GHz band, it would not be backward compatible with all earlier WiFi generations.  However, the speed at which the devices run depends on which WiFi generation they are using. If you have a WiFi 5 computer connected to a WiFi 4 router, the computer can only work at the speeds offered by the router. The same thing will happen if you have a WiFi 4 computer connected to a WiFi 5 router.   To take advantage of everything WiFi 5 offers, all of the connected devices, and the router will need to have the 802.11ac standard built into them.  Coverage area varies based on the frequency band and WiFi blocking materials (walls, furniture, and building material). The 2.4 GHz frequency is able to travel farther and penetrate obstructions better than the 5 GHz frequency. Lifewire states that WiFi routers operating on the 2.4 GHz band can cover up to 150 feet indoors and 300 feet outdoors. Typically, the range will be 10 to 15 feet shorter when using the 5 GHz band.  To improve on the range of the router, devices like WiFi extenders and mesh networks have been developed.  The IP-COM WiFi AC1200 EW9 and EP9 units work together to wirelessly blanket offices, hotels, restaurants, and other small to medium businesses with fast, reliable WiFi. It uses an EW9 router and two EP9 nodes. With True Mesh and Beamforming, the units work together to cover up to 6,000 sq ft with reliable WiFi. The IP-COM Enterprise Mesh System can support many devices at the same time without lag. Advanced encryption technology ensures all data and devices are protected from attacks. \n           WiFi extenders are wireless or wired gadgets that connect to the router and are plugged into a power source to extend the WiFi range. They should be placed in an area that is close enough to the router to get a strong signal, but far enough away to broadcast the signal into the needed areas. After the extender is connected, it\u2019s almost like having two access points. The extender will have its own network name (SSID) and its own password. When you move around your house, you will manually have to change your network connection between your router and the WiFi extender. They tend to work best in small homes and apartments.  Mesh network systems are designed to blanket your entire home with WiFi coverage. They are made up of multiple mesh nodes that work together to extend the WiFi range. One node will be directly connected to the modem using an ethernet cable (fast ethernet or gigabit ethernet), and the other nodes will be stationed around your home. They create one large seamless wireless network. With a mesh network, you will only have one WiFi network name (SSID) and password. As you roam around your house, your phone will automatically connect to the node that is closest to it. Mesh systems tend to work best in medium to large homes, offices, and large buildings.  Since it\u2019s been a few years since WiFi 5 was released, most WiFi devices such as phones, tablets, computers, and router, have the 802.11ac chipsets implemented in their hardware. You can get wireless-ac routers and clients at your local electronic store, phone store, or directly from the manufactures (Apple, Samsung, ASUS, Netgear, etc).  The Tenda 4G09 is a hassle-free plug-and-play router. Dual band allows you to make the most of both frequencies, meaning a stronger, more stable signal even through obstacles. Simply attach the antennas, insert an active SIM card, plug it in, and voila, instant internet access for all devices. Easily configure the network to meet your needs via the Tenda WiFi app.\n           WiFi standards are always evolving to improve the WLAN experience for all IoT (internet of things) devices. 802.11ax, or WiFi 6, is the next generation of WiFi. It builds on, and improves, the WiFi technology WiFi 5 offers - faster wireless speeds, high throughput, lower latency, and more bandwidth.  The Tenda RX9 Pro is everything you need for a safe, reliable, and fast WiFi connection for your home or office. With WiFi 6 and dual-band you can get speeds up to 3000Mbps, as well as enjoy a more reliable signal even through obstacles.

Many types of sensors use capacitive sensing, including sensors to detect and measure proximity, pressure, position and displacement, force, humidity, fluid level, and acceleration. Human interface devices based on capacitive sensing, such as touchpads,[1] can replace the computer mouse. Digital audio players, mobile phones, and tablet computers will sometimes use capacitive sensing touchscreens as input devices.[2] Capacitive sensors can also replace mechanical buttons.\n A capacitive touchscreen typically consists of a capacitive touch sensor along with at least two complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) controller and a digital signal processor (DSP). Capacitive sensing is commonly used for mobile multi-touch displays, popularized by Apple's iPhone in 2007.[3][4]\n Capacitive sensors are constructed from many different media, such as copper, indium tin oxide (ITO) and printed ink. Copper capacitive sensors can be implemented on standard FR4 PCBs as well as on flexible material. ITO allows the capacitive sensor to be up to 90% transparent (for one layer solutions, such as touch phone screens). Size and spacing of the capacitive sensor are both very important to the sensor's performance. In addition to the size of the sensor, and its spacing relative to the ground plane, the type of ground plane used is very important. Since the parasitic capacitance of the sensor is related to the electric field's (e-field) path to ground, it is important to choose a ground plane that limits the concentration of e-field lines with no conductive object present.\n Designing a capacitance sensing system requires first picking the type of sensing material (FR4, Flex, ITO, etc.). One also needs to understand the environment the device will operate in, such as the full operating temperature range, what radio frequencies are present and how the user will interact with the interface.\n There are two types of capacitive sensing systems: mutual capacitance,[5] where the object (finger, conductive stylus) alters the mutual coupling between row and column electrodes, which are scanned sequentially;[6] and self- or absolute capacitance where the object (such as a finger) loads the sensor or increases the parasitic capacitance to ground. In both cases, the difference of a preceding absolute position from the present absolute position yields the relative motion of the object or finger during that time. The technologies are elaborated in the following section.\n In this basic technology, only one side of the insulator is coated with conductive material. A small voltage is applied to this layer, resulting in a uniform electrostatic field.[7] When a conductor, such as a human finger, touches the uncoated surface, a capacitor is dynamically formed. Because of the sheet resistance of the surface, each corner is measured to have a different effective capacitance. The sensor's controller can determine the location of the touch indirectly from the change in the capacitance as measured from the four corners of the panel: the larger the change in capacitance, the closer the touch is to that corner. With no moving parts, it is moderately durable, but has low resolution, is prone to false signals from parasitic capacitive coupling, and needs calibration during manufacture. Therefore, it is most often used in simple applications such as industrial controls and interactive kiosks.[8]\n Projected capacitive touch (PCT) technology is a capacitive technology which allows more accurate and flexible operation, by etching the conductive layer. An X-Y grid is formed either by etching one layer to form a grid pattern of electrodes, or by etching two separate, parallel layers of conductive material with perpendicular lines or tracks to form the grid; comparable to the pixel grid found in many liquid crystal displays (LCD).[9]\n The greater resolution of PCT allows operation with no direct contact, such that the conducting layers can be coated with further protective insulating layers, and operate even under screen protectors, or behind weather and vandal-proof glass. Because the top layer of a PCT is glass, PCT is a more robust solution versus resistive touch technology. Depending on the implementation, an active or passive stylus can be used instead of or in addition to a finger. This is common with point of sale devices that require signature capture. Gloved fingers may not be sensed, depending on the implementation and gain settings. Conductive smudges and similar interference on the panel surface can interfere with the performance. Such conductive smudges come mostly from sticky or sweaty finger tips, especially in high humidity environments. Collected dust, which adheres to the screen because of moisture from fingertips can also be a problem.\n There are two types of PCT: self capacitance, and mutual capacitance.\n Mutual capacitive sensors have a capacitor at each intersection of each row and each column. A 12-by-16 array, for example, would have 192 independent capacitors. A voltage is applied to the rows or columns. Bringing a finger or conductive stylus near the surface of the sensor changes the local electric field which reduces the mutual capacitance. The capacitance change at every individual point on the grid can be measured to accurately determine the touch location by measuring the voltage in the other axis. Mutual capacitance allows multi-touch operation where multiple fingers, palms or styli can be accurately tracked at the same time.[10]\n Self-capacitance sensors can have the same X-Y grid as mutual capacitance sensors, but the columns and rows operate independently. With self-capacitance, current senses the capacitive load of a finger on each column or row. This produces a stronger signal than mutual capacitance sensing, but it is unable to resolve accurately more than one finger, which results in \"ghosting\", or misplaced location sensing.[11]\n Capacitance is typically measured indirectly, by using it to control the frequency of an oscillator, or to vary the level of coupling (or attenuation) of an AC signal.\n The design of a simple capacitance meter is often based on a relaxation oscillator. The capacitance to be sensed forms a portion of the oscillator's RC circuit or LC circuit. Basically the technique works by charging the unknown capacitance with a known current. (The equation of state for a capacitor is i = C dv/dt. This means that the capacitance equals the current divided by the rate of change of voltage across the capacitor.) The capacitance can be calculated by measuring the charging time required to reach the threshold voltage (of the relaxation oscillator), or equivalently, by measuring the oscillator's frequency. Both of these are proportional to the RC (or LC) time constant of the oscillator circuit.\n The primary source of error in capacitance measurements is stray capacitance, which if not guarded against, may fluctuate between roughly 10 pF and 10 nF. The stray capacitance can be held relatively constant by shielding the (high impedance) capacitance signal and then connecting the shield to (a low impedance) ground reference. Also, to minimize the unwanted effects of stray capacitance, it is good practice to locate the sensing electronics as near the sensor electrodes as possible.\n Another measurement technique is to apply a fixed-frequency AC-voltage signal across a capacitive divider. This consists of two capacitors in series, one of a known value and the other of an unknown value. An output signal is then taken from across one of the capacitors. The value of the unknown capacitor can be found from the ratio of capacitances, which equals the ratio of the output/input signal amplitudes, as could be measured by an AC voltmeter. More accurate instruments may use a capacitance bridge configuration, similar to a Wheatstone bridge.[12] The capacitance bridge helps to compensate for any variability that may exist in the applied signal.\n Capacitive touchscreens are more responsive than resistive touchscreens (which react to any object since no capacitance is needed), but less accurate. However, projective capacitance improves a touchscreen's accuracy as it forms a triangulated grid around the point of touch.[13]\n A standard stylus cannot be used for capacitive sensing, but special capacitive stylus, which are conductive, exist for the purpose.  One can even make a capacitive stylus by wrapping conductive material, such as anti-static conductive film, around a standard stylus or rolling the film into a tube.[14]  Capacitive touchscreens are more expensive to manufacture than resistive touchscreens.[citation needed] Some cannot be used with gloves, and can fail to sense correctly with even a small amount of water on the screen.\n Mutual capacitive sensors can provide a two-dimensional image of the changes in the electric field. Using this image, a range of applications have been proposed. Authenticating users,[15][16] estimating the orientation of fingers touching the screen[17][18] and differentiating between fingers and palms[19] become possible. While capacitive sensors are used for the touchscreens of most smartphones, the capacitive image is typically not exposed to the application layer.\n Power supplies with a high level of electronic noise can reduce accuracy.\n Many stylus designs for resistive touchscreens will not register on capacitive sensors because they are not conductive. Styluses that work on capacitive touchscreens primarily designed for fingers are required to simulate the difference in dielectric offered by a human finger.[20]\n"], "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_text": [" Predictive text is an input technology used where one key or button represents many letters, such as on the numeric keypads of mobile phones and in accessibility technologies. Each key press results in a  prediction rather than repeatedly sequencing through the same group of \"letters\" it represents, in the same, invariable order.  Predictive text could allow for an entire word to be input by single keypress.  Predictive text makes efficient use of fewer device keys to input writing into a text message, an e-mail, an address book, a calendar, and the like.\n The most widely used, general, predictive text systems are T9, iTap, eZiText, and LetterWise/WordWise.  There are many ways to build a device that predicts text, but all predictive text systems have initial linguistic settings that offer predictions that are re-prioritized to adapt to each user.  This learning adapts, by way of the device memory, to a user's disambiguating feedback that results in corrective key presses, such as pressing a \"next\" key to get to the intention. Most predictive text systems have a user database to facilitate this process.\n Theoretically the number of keystrokes required per desired character in the finished writing is, on average, comparable to using a keyboard.  This is approximately true providing that all words used are in its database, punctuation is ignored, and no input mistakes are made typing or spelling.[1]\nThe theoretical keystrokes per character, KSPC, of a keyboard is KSPC=1.00, and of multi-tap is KSPC=2.03. Eatoni's LetterWise is a predictive multi-tap hybrid, which when operating on a standard telephone keypad achieves KSPC=1.15 for English.\n The choice of which predictive text system is the best to use involves matching the user's preferred interface style, the user's level of learned ability to operate predictive text software, and the user's efficiency goal. There are various levels of risk in predictive text systems, versus multi-tap systems, because the predicted text that is automatically written that provide the speed and mechanical efficiency benefit, could, if the user is not careful to review, result in transmitting misinformation.  Predictive text systems take time to learn to use well, and so generally, a device's system has user options to set up the choice of multi-tap or of any one of several schools of predictive text methods.\n Short message service (SMS) permits a mobile phone user to send text messages (also called messages, SMSes, texts, and txts) as a short message.  The most common system of SMS text input is referred to as \"multi-tap\". Using multi-tap, a key is pressed multiple times to access the list of letters on that key. For instance, pressing the \"2\" key once displays an \"a\", twice displays a \"b\" and three times displays a \"c\". To enter two successive letters that are on the same key, the user must either pause or hit a \"next\" button. A user can type by pressing an alphanumeric keypad without looking at the electronic equipment display. Thus, multi-tap is easy to understand, and can be used without any visual feedback. However, multi-tap is not very efficient, requiring potentially many keystrokes to enter a single letter.\n In ideal predictive text entry, all words used are in the dictionary, punctuation is ignored, no spelling mistakes are made, and no typing mistakes are made.  The ideal dictionary would include all slang, proper nouns, abbreviations, URLs, foreign-language words and other user-unique words.  This ideal circumstance gives predictive text software the reduction in the number of key strokes a user is required to enter a word. The user presses the number corresponding to each letter and, as long as the word exists in the predictive text dictionary, or is correctly disambiguated by non-dictionary systems, it will appear.  For instance, pressing \"4663\" will typically  be interpreted as the word good, provided that a linguistic database in English is currently in use, though alternatives such as home, hood and hoof are also valid interpretations of the sequence of key strokes.\n The most widely used systems of predictive text are Tegic's T9, Motorola's iTap, and the Eatoni Ergonomics' LetterWise and WordWise.  T9 and iTap use dictionaries, but Eatoni Ergonomics' products uses a disambiguation process, a set of statistical rules to recreate words from keystroke sequences.  All predictive text systems require a linguistic database for every supported input language.\n Traditional disambiguation works by referencing a dictionary of commonly used words, though Eatoni offers a dictionaryless disambiguation system.\n In dictionary-based systems, as the user presses the number buttons, an algorithm searches the dictionary for a list of possible words that match the keypress combination, and offers up the most probable choice. The user can then confirm the selection and move on, or use a key to cycle through the possible combinations.\n A non-dictionary system constructs words and other sequences of letters from the statistics of word parts. To attempt predictions of the intended result of keystrokes not yet entered, disambiguation may be combined with a word completion facility.\n Either system (disambiguation or predictive) may include a user database, which can be further classified as a \"learning\" system when words or phrases are entered into the user database without direct user intervention.  The user database is for storing words or phrases which are not well disambiguated by the pre-supplied database. Some disambiguation systems further attempt to correct spelling, format text or perform other automatic rewrites, with the risky effect of either enhancing or frustrating user efforts to enter text.\n The actuating keys of the Chinese typewriter created by Lin Yutang in the 1940s included suggestions for the characters following the one selected.  In 1951, the Chinese typesetter Zhang Jiying arranged Chinese characters in associative clusters, a precursor of modern predictive text entry, and broke speed records by doing so.[2]  Predictive entry of text from a telephone keypad has been known at least since the 1970s (Smith and Goodwin, 1971). Predictive text was mainly used to look up names in directories over the phone, until mobile phone text messaging came into widespread use.\n On a typical phone keypad, if users wished to type the in a \"multi-tap\" keypad entry system, they would need to:\n Meanwhile, in a phone with predictive text, they need only:\n The system updates the display as each keypress is entered, to show the most probable entry. In this example, prediction reduced the number of button presses from five to three. The effect is even greater with longer words and those composed of letters later in each key's sequence.\n A dictionary-based predictive system is based on hope that the desired word is in the dictionary. That hope may be misplaced if the word differs in any way from common usage\u2014in particular, if the word is not spelled or typed correctly, is slang, or is a proper noun.  In these cases, some other mechanism must be used to enter the word. Furthermore, the simple dictionary approach fails with agglutinative languages, where a single word does not necessarily represent a single semantic entity.\n Predictive text is developed and marketed in a variety of competing products, such as Nuance Communications's T9. Other products include Motorola's iTap,  Eatoni Ergonomic's LetterWise (character, rather than word-based prediction), WordWise (word-based prediction without a dictionary), EQ3 (a QWERTY-like layout compatible with regular telephone keypads); Prevalent Devices's Phraze-It; Xrgomics' TenGO (a six-key reduced QWERTY keyboard system); Adaptxt (considers language, context, grammar and semantics); Lightkey (a predictive typing software for Windows); Clevertexting (statistical nature of the language, dictionaryless, dynamic key allocation); and  Oizea Type (temporal ambiguity); Intelab's Tauto; WordLogic's Intelligent Input Platform\u2122 (patented, layer-based advanced text prediction, includes multi-language dictionary, spell-check, built-in Web search).\n Words produced by the same combination of keypresses have been called \"textonyms\";[3] also \"txtonyms\";[4] or \"T9onyms\" (pronounced \"tynonyms\" /\u02c8ta\u026an\u0259n\u026amz/[3]), though they are not specific to T9. Selecting the wrong textonym can occur with no misspelling or typo, if the wrong textonym is selected by default or user error. As mentioned above, the key sequence 4663 on a telephone keypad, provided with a linguistic database in English, will generally be disambiguated as the word good. However, the same key sequence also corresponds to other words, such as home, gone, hoof, hood and so on.  For example, \"Are you home?\" could be rendered as \"Are you good?\" if the user neglects to alter the default 4663 word. This can lead to misunderstandings; for example sequence 735328 might correspond to either select or its antonym reject.  A 2010 brawl that led to manslaughter was sparked by a textonym error.[5] Predictive text choosing a default different from that which the user expects has similarities with the Cupertino effect, by which spell-check software changes a spelling to that of an unintended word.\n Textonyms have been used as Millennial slang; for example, the use of the word book to mean cool, since book is the default in those predictive text systems that assume it is more frequent than cool.[6] This is related to cacography.\n Textonyms are not the only issue limiting the effectiveness of predictive text implementations. Another significant problem are words for which the disambiguation produces a single, incorrect response. The system may, for example, respond with Blairf upon input of 252473, when the intended word was Blaise or Claire, both of which correspond to the keystroke sequence, but are not, in this example, found by the predictive text system. When typos or misspellings  occur, they are very unlikely to be recognized correctly by a disambiguation system, though error correction mechanisms may mitigate that effect.\n"], "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11": [" \n IEEE 802.11 is part of the IEEE 802 set of local area network (LAN) technical standards, and specifies the set of media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless local area network (WLAN) computer communication. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi brand and are the world's most widely used wireless computer networking standards. IEEE 802.11 is used in most home and office networks to allow laptops, printers, smartphones, and other devices to communicate with each other and access the Internet without connecting wires. IEEE 802.11 is also a basis  for vehicle-based communication networks IEEE 802.11p.\n The standards are created and maintained by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802). The base version of the standard was released in 1997 and has had subsequent amendments. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote the capabilities of their products. As a result, in the marketplace, each revision tends to become its own standard.\n IEEE 802.11 uses various frequencies including, but not limited to, 2.4\u00a0GHz, 5\u00a0GHz, 6\u00a0GHz, and 60\u00a0GHz frequency bands. Although IEEE 802.11 specifications list channels that might be used, the radio frequency spectrum availability allowed varies significantly by regulatory domain.\n The protocols are typically used in conjunction with IEEE 802.2, and are designed to interwork seamlessly with Ethernet, and are very often used to carry Internet Protocol traffic.\n The 802.11 family consists of a series of half-duplex over-the-air modulation techniques that use the same basic protocol. The 802.11 protocol family employs carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) whereby equipment listens to a channel for other users (including non 802.11 users) before transmitting each frame (some use the term \"packet\", which may be ambiguous: \"frame\" is more technically correct).\n 802.11-1997 was the first wireless networking standard in the family, but 802.11b was the first widely accepted one, followed by 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac. Other standards in the family (c\u2013f, h, j) are service amendments that are used to extend the current scope of the existing standard, which amendments may also include corrections to a previous specification.[1]\n 802.11b and 802.11g use the 2.4-GHz ISM band, operating in the United States under Part 15 of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission Rules and Regulations. 802.11n can also use that 2.4-GHz band. Because of this choice of frequency band, 802.11b/g/n equipment may occasionally suffer interference in the 2.4-GHz band from microwave ovens, cordless telephones, and Bluetooth devices. 802.11b and 802.11g control their interference and susceptibility to interference by using direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling methods, respectively.\n 802.11a uses the 5\u00a0GHz U-NII band which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping, 20-MHz-wide channels. This is an advantage over the 2.4-GHz, ISM-frequency band, which offers only three non-overlapping, 20-MHz-wide channels where other adjacent channels overlap (see: list of WLAN channels). Better or worse performance with higher or lower frequencies (channels) may be realized, depending on the environment. 802.11n and 802.11ax can use either the 2.4\u00a0GHz or 5\u00a0GHz band; 802.11ac uses only the 5\u00a0GHz band.\n The segment of the radio frequency spectrum used by 802.11 varies between countries. In the US, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations. Frequencies used by channels one through six of 802.11b and 802.11g fall within the 2.4\u00a0GHz amateur radio band. Licensed amateur radio operators may operate 802.11b/g devices under Part 97 of the FCC Rules and Regulations, allowing increased power output but not commercial content or encryption.[2]\n In 2018, the Wi-Fi Alliance began using a consumer-friendly generation numbering scheme for the publicly used 802.11 protocols. Wi-Fi generations 1\u20136 refer to the 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax protocols, in that order.[7][8]\n 802.11 technology has its origins in a 1985 ruling by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission that released the ISM band[1] for unlicensed use.[9]\n In 1991 NCR Corporation/AT&T (now Nokia Labs and LSI Corporation) invented a precursor to 802.11 in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands. The inventors initially intended to use the technology for cashier systems. The first wireless products were brought to the market under the name WaveLAN with raw data rates of 1\u00a0Mbit/s and 2\u00a0Mbit/s.\n Vic Hayes, who held the chair of IEEE 802.11 for 10 years, and has been called the \"father of Wi-Fi\", was involved in designing the initial 802.11b and 802.11a standards within the IEEE.[10] He, along with Bell Labs Engineer Bruce Tuch, approached IEEE to create a standard.[11]\n In 1999, the Wi-Fi Alliance was formed as a trade association to hold the Wi-Fi trademark under which most products are sold.[12]\n The major commercial breakthrough came with Apple's adopting Wi-Fi for their iBook series of laptops in 1999. It was the first mass consumer product to offer Wi-Fi network connectivity, which was then branded by Apple as AirPort.[13][14][15] One year later IBM followed with its ThinkPad 1300 series in 2000.[16]\n The original version of the standard IEEE 802.11 was released in 1997 and clarified in 1999, but is now obsolete. It specified two net bit rates of 1 or 2 megabits per second (Mbit/s), plus forward error correction code. It specified three alternative physical layer technologies: diffuse infrared operating at 1\u00a0Mbit/s; frequency-hopping spread spectrum operating at 1\u00a0Mbit/s or 2\u00a0Mbit/s; and direct-sequence spread spectrum operating at 1\u00a0Mbit/s or 2\u00a0Mbit/s. The latter two radio technologies used microwave transmission over the Industrial Scientific Medical frequency band at 2.4\u00a0GHz. Some earlier WLAN technologies used lower frequencies, such as the U.S. 900\u00a0MHz ISM band.\n Legacy 802.11 with direct-sequence spread spectrum was rapidly supplanted and popularized by 802.11b.\n 802.11a, published in 1999, uses the same data link layer protocol and frame format as the original standard, but an OFDM based air interface (physical layer) was added.\n It operates in the 5\u00a0GHz band with a maximum net data rate of 54\u00a0Mbit/s, plus error correction code, which yields realistic net achievable throughput in the mid-20 Mbit/s.[36] It has seen widespread worldwide implementation, particularly within the corporate workspace.\n Since the 2.4\u00a0GHz band is heavily used to the point of being crowded, using the relatively unused 5\u00a0GHz band gives 802.11a a significant advantage. However, this high carrier frequency also brings a disadvantage: the effective overall range of 802.11a is less than that of 802.11b/g. In theory, 802.11a signals are absorbed more readily by walls and other solid objects in their path due to their smaller wavelength, and, as a result, cannot penetrate as far as those of 802.11b. In practice, 802.11b typically has a higher range at low speeds (802.11b will reduce speed to 5.5\u00a0Mbit/s or even 1\u00a0Mbit/s at low signal strengths). 802.11a also suffers from interference,[37] but locally there may be fewer signals to interfere with, resulting in less interference and better throughput.\n The 802.11b standard has a maximum raw data rate of 11\u00a0Mbit/s (Megabits per second) and uses the same media access method defined in the original standard. 802.11b products appeared on the market in early 2000, since 802.11b is a direct extension of the modulation technique defined in the original standard. The dramatic increase in throughput of 802.11b (compared to the original standard) along with simultaneous substantial price reductions led to the rapid acceptance of 802.11b as the definitive wireless LAN technology.\n Devices using 802.11b experience interference from other products operating in the 2.4\u00a0GHz band. Devices operating in the 2.4\u00a0GHz range include microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, baby monitors, cordless telephones, and some amateur radio equipment. As unlicensed intentional radiators in this ISM band, they must not interfere with and must tolerate interference from primary or secondary allocations (users) of this band, such as amateur radio.\n In June 2003, a third modulation standard was ratified: 802.11g. This works in the 2.4\u00a0GHz band (like 802.11b), but uses the same OFDM based transmission scheme as 802.11a. It operates at a maximum physical layer bit rate of 54\u00a0Mbit/s exclusive of forward error correction codes, or about 22\u00a0Mbit/s average throughput.[38] 802.11g hardware is fully backward compatible with 802.11b hardware, and therefore is encumbered with legacy issues that reduce throughput by ~21% when compared to 802.11a.[39]\n The then-proposed 802.11g standard was rapidly adopted in the market starting in January 2003, well before ratification, due to the desire for higher data rates as well as reductions in manufacturing costs.[citation needed] By summer 2003, most dual-band 802.11a/b products became dual-band/tri-mode, supporting a and b/g in a single mobile adapter card or access point. Details of making b and g work well together occupied much of the lingering technical process; in an 802.11g network, however, the activity of an 802.11b participant will reduce the data rate of the overall 802.11g network.\n Like 802.11b, 802.11g devices also suffer interference from other products operating in the 2.4\u00a0GHz band, for example, wireless keyboards.\n In 2003, task group TGma was authorized to \"roll up\" many of the amendments to the 1999 version of the 802.11 standard. REVma or 802.11ma, as it was called, created a single document that merged 8 amendments (802.11a, b, d, e, g, h, i, j) with the base standard. Upon approval on 8 March 2007, 802.11REVma was renamed to the then-current base standard IEEE 802.11-2007.[40]\n 802.11n is an amendment that improves upon the previous 802.11 standards; its first draft of certification was published in 2006. The 802.11n standard was retroactively labelled as Wi-Fi 4 by the Wi-Fi Alliance.[41][42] The standard added support for multiple-input multiple-output antennas (MIMO). 802.11n operates on both the 2.4\u00a0GHz and the 5\u00a0GHz bands. Support for 5\u00a0GHz bands is optional. Its net data rate ranges from 54\u00a0Mbit/s to 600\u00a0Mbit/s. The IEEE has approved the amendment, and it was published in October 2009.[43][44] Prior to the final ratification, enterprises were already migrating to 802.11n networks based on the Wi-Fi Alliance's certification of products conforming to a 2007 draft of the 802.11n proposal.\n In May 2007, task group TGmb was authorized to \"roll up\" many of the amendments to the 2007 version of the 802.11 standard.[45] REVmb or 802.11mb, as it was called, created a single document that merged ten amendments (802.11k, r, y, n, w, p, z, v, u, s) with the 2007 base standard. In addition much cleanup was done, including a reordering of many of the clauses.[46]  Upon publication on 29 March 2012, the new standard was referred to as IEEE 802.11-2012.\n IEEE 802.11ac-2013 is an amendment to IEEE 802.11, published in December 2013, that builds on 802.11n.[47] The 802.11ac standard was retroactively labelled as Wi-Fi 5 by the Wi-Fi Alliance.[41][42] Changes compared to 802.11n include wider channels (80 or 160\u00a0MHz versus 40\u00a0MHz) in the 5\u00a0GHz band, more spatial streams (up to eight versus four), higher-order modulation (up to 256-QAM vs. 64-QAM), and the addition of Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO). The Wi-Fi Alliance separated the introduction of ac wireless products into two phases (\"waves\"), named \"Wave 1\" and \"Wave 2\".[48][49] From mid-2013, the alliance started certifying Wave 1 802.11ac products shipped by manufacturers, based on the IEEE 802.11ac Draft 3.0 (the IEEE standard was not finalized until later that year).[50] In 2016 Wi-Fi Alliance introduced the Wave 2 certification, to provide higher bandwidth and capacity than Wave 1 products. Wave 2 products include additional features like MU-MIMO, 160\u00a0MHz channel width support, support for more 5\u00a0GHz channels, and four spatial streams (with four antennas; compared to three in Wave 1 and 802.11n, and eight in IEEE's 802.11ax specification).[51][52]\n IEEE 802.11ad is an amendment that defines a new physical layer for 802.11 networks to operate in the 60\u00a0GHz millimeter wave spectrum. This frequency band has significantly different propagation characteristics than the 2.4\u00a0GHz and 5\u00a0GHz bands where Wi-Fi networks operate. Products implementing the 802.11ad standard are being brought to market under the WiGig brand name. The certification program is now being developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance instead of the now defunct Wireless Gigabit Alliance.[53] The peak transmission rate of 802.11ad is 7\u00a0Gbit/s.[54]\n IEEE 802.11ad is a protocol used for very high data rates (about 8 Gbit/s) and for short range communication (about 1\u201310 meters).[55]\n TP-Link announced the world's first 802.11ad router in January 2016.[56]\n The WiGig standard is not too well known, although it was announced in 2009 and added to the IEEE 802.11 family in December 2012.\n IEEE 802.11af, also referred to as \"White-Fi\" and \"Super Wi-Fi\",[57] is an amendment, approved in February 2014, that allows WLAN operation in TV white space spectrum in the VHF and UHF bands between 54 and 790\u00a0MHz.[58][59] It uses cognitive radio technology to transmit on unused TV channels, with the standard taking measures to limit interference for primary users, such as analog TV, digital TV, and wireless microphones.[59] Access points and stations determine their position using a satellite positioning system such as GPS, and use the Internet to query a geolocation database (GDB) provided by a regional regulatory agency to discover what frequency channels are available for use at a given time and position.[59] The physical layer uses OFDM and is based on 802.11ac.[60] The propagation path loss as well as the attenuation by materials such as brick and concrete is lower in the UHF and VHF bands than in the 2.4\u00a0GHz and 5\u00a0GHz bands, which increases the possible range.[59] The frequency channels are 6 to 8\u00a0MHz wide, depending on the regulatory domain.[59] Up to four channels may be bonded in either one or two contiguous blocks.[59] MIMO operation is possible with up to four streams used for either space\u2013time block code (STBC) or multi-user (MU) operation.[59] The achievable data rate per spatial stream is 26.7\u00a0Mbit/s for 6 and 7\u00a0MHz channels, and 35.6\u00a0Mbit/s for 8\u00a0MHz channels.[34] With four spatial streams and four bonded channels, the maximum data rate is 426.7\u00a0Mbit/s for 6 and 7\u00a0MHz channels and 568.9\u00a0Mbit/s for 8\u00a0MHz channels.[34]\n IEEE 802.11-2016 which was known as IEEE 802.11 REVmc,[61] is a revision based on IEEE 802.11-2012, incorporating 5 amendments (11ae, 11aa, 11ad, 11ac, 11af). In addition, existing MAC and PHY functions have been enhanced and obsolete features were removed or marked for removal. Some clauses and annexes have been renumbered.[62]\n IEEE 802.11ah, published in 2017,[63] defines a WLAN system operating at sub-1\u00a0GHz license-exempt bands. Due to the favorable propagation characteristics of the low frequency spectra, 802.11ah can provide improved transmission range compared with the conventional 802.11 WLANs operating in the 2.4\u00a0GHz and 5\u00a0GHz\u00a0bands. 802.11ah can be used for various purposes including large scale sensor networks,[64] extended range hotspot, and outdoor Wi-Fi for cellular traffic offloading, whereas the available bandwidth is relatively narrow. The protocol intends consumption to be competitive with low power Bluetooth, at a much wider range.[65]\n IEEE 802.11ai is an amendment to the 802.11 standard that added new mechanisms for a faster initial link setup time.[66]\n IEEE 802.11aj is a derivative of 802.11ad for use in the 45\u00a0GHz unlicensed spectrum available in some regions of the world (specifically China); it also provides additional capabilities for use in the 60\u00a0GHz band.[66]\n Alternatively known as China Millimeter Wave (CMMW).\n IEEE 802.11aq is an amendment to the 802.11 standard that will enable pre-association discovery of services. This extends some of the mechanisms in 802.11u that enabled device discovery to discover further the services running on a device, or provided by a network.[66]\n IEEE 802.11-2020, which was known as IEEE 802.11 REVmd,[67] is a revision based on IEEE 802.11-2016 incorporating 5 amendments (11ai, 11ah, 11aj, 11ak, 11aq). In addition, existing MAC and PHY functions have been enhanced and obsolete features were removed or marked for removal. Some clauses and annexes have been added.[68]\n IEEE 802.11ax is the successor to 802.11ac, marketed as Wi-Fi 6 (2.4\u00a0GHz and 5\u00a0GHz)[69] and Wi-Fi 6E (6\u00a0GHz)[70] by the Wi-Fi Alliance. It is also known as High Efficiency Wi-Fi, for the overall improvements to Wi-Fi 6 clients under dense environments.[71] For an individual client, the maximum improvement in data rate  (PHY speed) against the predecessor (802.11ac) is only 39%[a] (for comparison, this improvement was nearly 500%[b] for the predecessors).[c] Yet, even with this comparatively minor 39% figure, the goal was to provide 4 times the throughput-per-area[d] of 802.11ac (hence High Efficiency). The motivation behind this goal was the deployment of WLAN in dense environments such as corporate offices, shopping malls and dense residential apartments.[71] This is achieved by means of a technique called OFDMA, which is basically multiplexing in the frequency domain (as opposed to spatial multiplexing, as in 802.11ac). This is equivalent to cellular technology applied into Wi-Fi.[71]:\u200aqt\u200a\n The IEEE 802.11ax\u20112021 standard was approved on February 9, 2021.[74][75]\n IEEE 802.11ay is a standard that is being developed, also called EDMG: Enhanced Directional MultiGigabit PHY.  It is an amendment that defines a new physical layer for 802.11 networks to operate in the 60\u00a0GHz millimeter wave spectrum. It will be an extension of the existing 11ad, aimed to extend the throughput, range, and use-cases. The main use-cases include indoor operation and short-range communications due to atmospheric oxygen absorption and inability to penetrate walls. The peak transmission rate of 802.11ay is 40\u00a0Gbit/s.[76] The main extensions include: channel bonding (2, 3 and 4), MIMO (up to 4 streams) and higher modulation schemes.  The expected range is 300-500 m.[77]\n IEEE 802.11ba Wake-up Radio (WUR) Operation is an amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard that enables energy efficient operation for data reception without increasing latency.[78] The target active power consumption to receive a WUR packet is less than 1 milliwatt and supports data rates of 62.5 kbit/s and 250 kbit/s. The WUR PHY uses MC-OOK (multicarrier OOK) to achieve extremely low power consumption.[79]\n IEEE 802.11be Extremely High Throughput (EHT) is the potential next amendment to the 802.11 IEEE standard,[80] and will likely be designated as Wi-Fi 7.[81][82] It will build upon 802.11ax, focusing on WLAN indoor and outdoor operation with stationary and pedestrian speeds in the 2.4\u00a0GHz, 5\u00a0GHz, and 6\u00a0GHz frequency bands.\n Across all variations of 802.11, maximum achievable throughputs are given either based on measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer-2 data rates. However, this does not apply to typical deployments in which data is being transferred between two endpoints, of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure and the other endpoint is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.\n This means that, typically, data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium and are being converted to 802.3 (Ethernet) or vice versa. Due to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the application's packet size determines the speed of the data transfer. This means applications that use small packets (e.g., VoIP) create dataflows with high-overhead traffic (i.e., a low goodput). Other factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and, of course, the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.[83][84]\n The same references apply to the attached graphs that show measurements of UDP throughput. Each represents an average (UDP) throughput (please note that the error bars are there but barely visible due to the small variation) of 25 measurements. Each is with a specific packet size (small or large) and with a specific data rate (10\u00a0kbit/s \u2013 100\u00a0Mbit/s). Markers for traffic profiles of common applications are included as well. These figures assume there are no packet errors, which, if occurring, will lower the transmission rate further.\n 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n-2.4 utilize the 2.400\u20132.500 GHz spectrum, one of the ISM bands. 802.11a, 802.11n, and 802.11ac use the more heavily regulated 4.915\u20135.825 GHz band. These are commonly referred to as the \"2.4\u00a0GHz and 5\u00a0GHz bands\" in most sales literature. Each spectrum is sub-divided into channels with a center frequency and bandwidth, analogous to how radio and TV broadcast bands are sub-divided.\n The 2.4\u00a0GHz band is divided into 14 channels spaced 5\u00a0MHz apart, beginning with channel\u00a01, which is centered on 2.412\u00a0GHz. The latter channels have additional restrictions or are unavailable for use in some regulatory domains.\n The channel numbering of the 5.725\u20135.875 GHz spectrum is less intuitive due to the differences in regulations between countries. These are discussed in greater detail on the list of WLAN channels.\n In addition to specifying the channel center frequency, 802.11 also specifies (in Clause 17) a spectral mask defining the permitted power distribution across each channel. The mask requires the signal to be attenuated a minimum of 20\u00a0dB from its peak amplitude at \u00b111\u00a0MHz from the center frequency, the point at which a channel is effectively 22\u00a0MHz wide.  One consequence is that stations can use only every fourth or fifth channel without overlap.\n Availability of channels is regulated by country, constrained in part by how each country allocates radio spectrum to various services. At one extreme, Japan permits the use of all 14 channels for 802.11b, and 1\u201313 for 802.11g/n-2.4.  Other countries such as Spain initially allowed only channels 10 and 11, and France allowed only 10, 11, 12, and 13; however, Europe now allow channels 1 through 13.[85][86] North America and some Central and South American countries allow only 1 through 11.\n Since the spectral mask defines only power output restrictions up to \u00b111\u00a0MHz from the center frequency to be attenuated by \u221250\u00a0dBr, it is often assumed that the energy of the channel extends no further than these limits. It is more correct to say that the overlapping signal on any channel should be sufficiently attenuated to interfere with a transmitter on any other channel minimally, given the separation between channels. Due to the near\u2013far problem a transmitter can impact (desensitize) a receiver on a \"non-overlapping\" channel, but only if it is close to the victim receiver (within a meter) or operating above allowed power levels. Conversely, a sufficiently distant transmitter on an overlapping channel can have little to no significant effect.\n Confusion often arises over the amount of channel separation required between transmitting devices. 802.11b was based on direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 22\u00a0MHz, resulting in three \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 6, and 11). 802.11g was based on OFDM modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 20\u00a0MHz. This occasionally leads to the belief that four \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 5, 9, and 13) exist under 802.11g. However, this is not the case as per 17.4.6.3 Channel Numbering of operating channels of the IEEE Std 802.11 (2012), which states, \"In a multiple cell network topology, overlapping and/or adjacent cells using different channels can operate simultaneously without interference if the distance between the center frequencies is at least 25\u00a0MHz.\"[87]\nand section 18.3.9.3 and Figure 18-13.\n This does not mean that the technical overlap of the channels recommends the non-use of overlapping channels.  The amount of inter-channel interference seen on a configuration using channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 (which is permitted in Europe, but not in North America) is barely different from a three-channel configuration, but with an entire extra channel.[88][89]\n However, overlap between channels with more narrow spacing (e.g. 1, 4, 7, 11 in North America) may cause unacceptable degradation of signal quality and throughput, particularly when users transmit near the boundaries of AP cells.[90]\n IEEE uses the phrase regdomain to refer to a legal regulatory region. Different countries define different levels of allowable transmitter power, time that a channel can be occupied, and different available channels.[91] Domain codes are specified for the United States, Canada, ETSI (Europe), Spain, France, Japan, and China.\n Most Wi-Fi certified devices default to regdomain 0, which means least common denominator settings, i.e., the device will not transmit at a power above the allowable power in any nation, nor will it use frequencies that are not permitted in any nation.[citation needed]\n The regdomain setting is often made difficult or impossible to change so that the end-users do not conflict with local regulatory agencies such as the United States' Federal Communications Commission.[citation needed]\n The datagrams are called frames. Current 802.11 standards specify frame types for use in the transmission of data as well as management and control of wireless links.\n Frames are divided into very specific and standardized sections. Each frame consists of a MAC header, payload, and frame check sequence (FCS). Some frames may not have a payload.\n The first two bytes of the MAC header form a frame control field specifying the form and function of the frame. This frame control field is subdivided into the following sub-fields:\n The next two bytes are reserved for the Duration ID field, indicating how long the field's transmission will take so other devices know when the channel will be available again. This field can take one of three forms: Duration, Contention-Free Period (CFP), and Association ID (AID).\n An 802.11 frame can have up to four address fields. Each field can carry a MAC address. Address 1 is the receiver, Address 2 is the transmitter, Address 3 is used for filtering purposes by the receiver.[dubious  \u2013 discuss]  Address 4 is only present in data frames transmitted between access points in an Extended Service Set or between intermediate nodes in a mesh network.\n The remaining fields of the header are:\n The payload or frame body field is variable in size, from 0 to 2304 bytes plus any overhead from security encapsulation, and contains information from higher layers.\n The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is the last four bytes in the standard 802.11 frame. Often referred to as the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), it allows for integrity checks of retrieved frames. As frames are about to be sent, the FCS is calculated and appended. When a station receives a frame, it can calculate the FCS of the frame and compare it to the one received. If they match, it is assumed that the frame was not distorted during transmission.[92]\n Management frames are not always authenticated, and allow for the maintenance, or discontinuance, of communication. Some common 802.11 subtypes include:\n The body of a management frame consists of frame-subtype-dependent fixed fields followed by a sequence of information elements (IEs).\n The common structure of an IE is as follows:\n Control frames facilitate the exchange of data frames between stations. Some common 802.11 control frames include:\n Data frames carry packets from web pages, files, etc. within the body.[93] The body begins with an IEEE 802.2 header, with the Destination Service Access Point (DSAP) specifying the protocol, followed by a Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) header if the DSAP is hex AA, with the organizationally unique identifier (OUI) and protocol ID (PID) fields specifying the protocol.  If the OUI is all zeroes, the protocol ID field is an EtherType value.[94] Almost all 802.11 data frames use 802.2 and SNAP headers, and most use an OUI of 00:00:00 and an EtherType value.\n Similar to TCP congestion control on the internet, frame loss is built into the operation of 802.11. To select the correct transmission speed or Modulation and Coding Scheme, a rate control algorithm may test different speeds. The actual packet loss rate of Access points varies widely for different link conditions. There are variations in the loss rate experienced on production Access points, between 10% and 80%, with 30% being a common average.[95] It is important to be aware that the link layer should recover these lost frames. If the sender does not receive an Acknowledgement (ACK) frame, then it will be resent.\n Within the IEEE 802.11 Working Group,[58] the following IEEE Standards Association Standard and Amendments exist:\n 802.11F and 802.11T are recommended practices rather than standards and are capitalized as such.\n 802.11m is used for standard maintenance. 802.11ma was completed for 802.11-2007, 802.11mb for 802.11-2012, 802.11mc for 802.11-2016, and 802.11md for 802.11-2020.\n Both the terms \"standard\" and \"amendment\" are used when referring to the different variants of IEEE standards.[97]\n As far as the IEEE Standards Association is concerned, there is only one current standard; it is denoted by IEEE 802.11 followed by the date published. IEEE 802.11-2020 is the only version currently in publication, superseding previous releases. The standard is updated by means of amendments. Amendments are created by task groups (TG). Both the task group and their finished document are denoted by 802.11 followed by one or two lower case letters, for example, IEEE 802.11a or IEEE 802.11ax. Updating 802.11 is the responsibility of task group m. In order to create a new version, TGm combines the previous version of the standard and all published amendments. TGm also provides clarification and interpretation to industry on published documents. New versions of the IEEE 802.11 were published in 1999, 2007, 2012, 2016, and 2020.[98][99]\n Various terms in 802.11 are used to specify aspects of wireless local-area networking operation and may be unfamiliar to some readers.\n For example, Time Unit (usually abbreviated TU) is used to indicate a unit of time equal to 1024 microseconds. Numerous time constants are defined in terms of TU (rather than the nearly equal millisecond).\n Also, the term \"Portal\" is used to describe an entity that is similar to an 802.1H bridge. A Portal provides access to the WLAN by non-802.11 LAN STAs.\n In 2001, a group from the University of California, Berkeley presented a paper describing weaknesses in the 802.11 Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) security mechanism defined in the original standard; they were followed by Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir's paper titled \"Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of RC4\". Not long after, Adam Stubblefield and AT&T publicly announced the first verification of the attack. In the attack, they were able to intercept transmissions and gain unauthorized access to wireless networks.[100]\n The IEEE set up a dedicated task group to create a replacement security solution, 802.11i (previously, this work was handled as part of a broader 802.11e effort to enhance the MAC layer). The Wi-Fi Alliance announced an interim specification called Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) based on a subset of the then-current IEEE 802.11i draft. These started to appear in products in mid-2003. IEEE 802.11i (also known as WPA2) itself was ratified in June 2004, and uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), instead of RC4, which was used in WEP. The modern recommended encryption for the home/consumer space is WPA2 (AES Pre-Shared Key), and for the enterprise space is WPA2 along with a RADIUS authentication server (or another type of authentication server) and a strong authentication method such as EAP-TLS.[citation needed]\n In January 2005, the IEEE set up yet another task group \"w\" to protect management and broadcast frames, which previously were sent unsecured. Its standard was published in 2009.[101]\n In December 2011, a security flaw was revealed that affects some wireless routers with a specific implementation of the optional Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) feature. While WPS is not a part of 802.11, the flaw allows an attacker within the range of the wireless router to recover the WPS PIN and, with it, the router's 802.11i password in a few hours.[102][103]\n In late 2014, Apple announced that its iOS\u00a08 mobile operating system would scramble MAC addresses[104] during the pre-association stage to thwart retail footfall tracking made possible by the regular transmission of uniquely identifiable probe requests.[citation needed]\n Wi-Fi users may be subjected to a Wi-Fi deauthentication attack to eavesdrop, attack passwords, or force the use of another, usually more expensive access point.[105]\n"], "https://www.notebookcheck.com/Mediatek-MT6737T-SoC-Benchmarks-und-Specs.197764.0.html": [" Der Mediatek MT6737\u00a0ist ein 2016 vorgestellter ARM-SoC (System-on-a-Chip) der Einstiegsklasse, der prim\u00e4r in Smartphones und Tablets (haupts\u00e4chlich Android) zu finden ist.

Windows 10 already supports a very wide range of media formats, both through native support and third-party apps. Most notably, Redmond added support for the Free Lossless Audio Codec on Windows with the launch of Windows 10 a few years ago. And now, it\u2019s adding support for the OGG media container, Vorbis audio codec, and the Theora video codec in Windows 10. According to the Microsoft Edge platform development status page, support for the OGG Container, Vorbis Audio Codec, and Theora Video Codec is now in development\u00a0for Windows 10 devices (PCs, Mixed Reality, Xbox, and Mobile). It isn\u2019t known when exactly Microsoft will ship support for these new media formats in Windows 10, but it will probably arrive with the release of Windows 10 Redstone 4 in early 2018. Windows 10 getting support for Vorbis is actually a bit interesting. That\u2019s because Microsoft recently killed Groove Music and is now in the process of transferring users to its partner Spotify. Although Spotify doesn\u2019t have a modern Windows 10 UWP app yet, the company\u2019s desktop app uses Vorbis powered by their built-in decoders. Microsoft adding support for Vorbis into Windows 10 could allow Spotify to achieve better performance and efficiency on its desktop app, or better yet: build a new UWP app without a lot of hassle that comes with porting its custom Vorbis decoders to\u00a0the UWP. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see how this plays out. Via: Ctrl Blog recent posts As an Amazon Associate MSpoweruser.com earns commission from qualifying purchases.

Regardless of the brand, most laptops have a built-in touchpad that allows users to control them. Rather than connecting a mouse, for instance, you can move your fingers around the laptop\u2019s touchpad. Doing so will essentially mimic the movements of a mouse, meaning the cursor will move in response to your finger movements.  There are two primary types of touchpads, however, including resistive and capacitive. Resistive touchpads work in a similar manner as resistive touchscreens, whereas capacitive touchpads use a similar mechanism as capacitive touchscreens. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with resistive and capacitive technology, keep reading to learn more about them and how they are used to power touchpads in laptops. A resistive touchpad is a type of laptop control system that uses pressure to detect a user\u2019s touch command. It acts like a miniature resistive touchscreen device. When you press your finger against a resistive touchpad, you\u2019ll push its two conductive layers together. The top layer will press into the bottom layer. The resistive touchpad will process this information to determine where you touched. Resistive touchpads have been around for decades. They offer a simple and effective way to control laptops. With that said, resistive touchpads have largely been replaced by capacitive. Since the turn of the 21st century, more and more laptop manufacturers have switched to capacitive touchpads. A capacitive touchpad, on the other hand, is a type of laptop control system that measures capacitance to detect a user\u2019s touch command. If you keep up with our blog here at Nelson Miller, you may recall reading about capacitive touchscreen devices. Whether it\u2019s a smartphone, tablet or human machine interface (HMI), capacitive touchscreen devices detect touch commands by measuring capacitance. Capacitive touchpads follow this same path by measuring capacitance to calculate a user\u2019s touch command. Capacitive touchpads generate a uniform electrostatic field during operation, meaning they have a constant and consistent electrical charge. When you press your finger against a capacitive touchpad, your finger will draw some of its electrical charge. The capacitive touchpad will notice the reduction of capacitance, which it will use to determine when and where you touched. Laptops are often designed with either a resistive or capacitive touchpad. Resistive touchpads use pressure to detect touch commands, whereas capacitive touchpads use capacitance to detect touch commands. They both support the use of touch commands, but they use different mechanisms to detect them. 708 Nogales StreetCity of Industry, CA 91748 No.1 Beinan AvenueHuangjiang Town Dongguan,Guangdong China 523759 \u00a0 311 Winton StreetWausau, WI 54403\u00a0 Windmolen 227609NN AlmeloNetherlands 202 S.

The maximum physical layer theoretical rate for Wave 1 is 1.3 Gbit/s, while Wave 2 can reach 2.34 Gbit/s. Wave 2 can therefore achieve 1 Gbit/s even if the real world throughput turns out to be only 50% of the theoretical rate. Wave 2 also supports a higher number of connected devices.[14]\n Several companies are currently offering 802.11ac chipsets with higher modulation rates: MCS-10 and MCS-11 (1024-QAM), supported by Quantenna and Broadcom. Although technically not part of 802.11ac, these new MCS indices are expected to become official in the 802.11ax standard (~2019), the successor to 802.11ac.[needs update]\n 160\u00a0MHz channels, and thus the throughput might be unusable in some countries/regions due to regulatory issues that allocated some frequencies for other purposes.\n 802.11ac-class device wireless speeds are often advertised as AC followed by a number, that number being the highest link rates in Mbit/s of all the simultaneously-usable radios in the device added up.  For example, an AC1900 access point might have 600 Mbit/s capability on its 2.4\u00a0GHz radio and 1300 Mbit/s capability on its 5\u00a0GHz radio.  No single client device could connect and achieve 1900 Mbit/s of throughput, but separate devices each connecting to the 2.4\u00a0GHz and 5\u00a0GHz radios could achieve combined throughput approaching 1900 Mbit/s.  Different possible stream configurations can add up to the same AC number.\n Quantenna released the first 802.11ac chipset for retail Wi-Fi routers and consumer electronics on November 15, 2011.[25] Redpine Signals released the first low power 802.11ac technology for smartphone application processors on December 14, 2011.[26] On January 5, 2012, Broadcom announced its first 802.11ac Wi-Fi chips and partners[27] and on April 27, 2012, Netgear announced the first Broadcom-enabled router.[28] On May 14, 2012, Buffalo Technology released the world\u2019s first 802.11ac products to market, releasing a wireless router and client bridge adapter.[29] On December 6, 2012, Huawei announced commercial availability of the industry's first enterprise-level 802.11ac Access Point.[30]\n Motorola Solutions is selling 802.11ac access points including the AP 8232.[31] In April 2014, Hewlett-Packard started selling the HP 560 access point in the controller-based WLAN enterprise market segment.[32]\n On June 7, 2012, it was reported that Asus had unveiled its ROG G75VX gaming notebook, which would be the first consumer-oriented notebook to be fully compliant with 802.11ac[33] (albeit in its \"draft 2.0\" version).\n Apple began implementing 802.11ac starting with the MacBook Air in June 2013,[34][35] followed by the MacBook Pro and Mac Pro later that year.[36][37]\n As of December\u00a02013,[update] Hewlett-Packard incorporates 802.11ac compliance in laptop computers.[38]\n"], "https://www.gigacalculator.com/converters/convert-mb-to-mbps.php": [" Use this converter to easily convert between MegaBytes per Second and MegaBits per Second (MB/s and Mbps). Using the binary convention megabyte (MB), there are 8.192 megabits per second (mbps) in 1 megabyte per second (MB/s). Using the SI (International System of Units) standard of the megabyte, there are 8,000 megabits per second in one megabyte per second. Both of the above answers are correct, depending on the agreed unit convention - the classic and widespread binary system in which units are powers of 2, or the decimal SI convention. According to the former one megabyte is 8,388,608, while according to the latter one megabyte is 8,000,000 bits, hence the difference. When using our MB to mbps converter you can switch to SI mode using the checkbox. A MegaBit per Second (mbps) is a standard bandwidth measurement metric for network equipment, such as routers, switches and LAN cards, and is equal to 1,000,000 bits per second, or 1,000 kilobits per second. A MB per second (MB/s) is a non-standard metric for network throughput, which is nevertheless often used due to its convenience since most file sizes are in MB, GB, etc. A MB can be defined in one of two ways: using the binary convention and using the SI standard, as described above. Mbps is often the unit in which your optic, broadband, LAN or DSL connection will be described in. You likely have a 100 megabit LAN card on your computer, meaning its maximum transfer rate is 100 mpbs. There are also 1 gbit (1 gbps bandwidth) and 10 gbit (10 gbps bandwidth) LAN cards as well. Currently the fastest available interfaces reach 160 gbits per second. A typical home connection, on the other hand, is usually between 10 and 200 mbps. The easiest way to convert MB/s to mbps is by using this converter. If you need a step by step solution: it is easiest to first convert each metric to bits per second, then convert back to the needed unit. For example, let us say you want to esimate how fast your connection needs to be to allow you to transfer 5 MB/s. If it is 5 MB/s SI, then that is 5,000,000 Bytes, and since a Byte is 8 bits, multiply by 8 to get 40,000,000 bits per second (bps). Converting back to mbps requires us to divide by 1,000,000, which gives us 40 mbps. So we need a 40 mbps connections to transfer 5 MB/s (decimal). If we want to measure megabytes in a way that they would appear in Windows and other operating systems, then 1 MB/s = 1,048,576 bytes per second. To convert to bits, multiply by 8: 1,048,576 x 8 = 8,388,608 bits per second. This converts to 8.388 mbps (8,388,608 / 1,000,000). More examples using a simplified calculation below. Sample task: convert 10 MB/s (binary, also MiB/s) to Mbps. Solution:  \nFormula:\r\n\t\tMBps * 8.388608 = Mbps\nCalculation:\r\n\t\t10 MBps * 8.3886 = 83.886080 Mbps\nEnd result:\r\n\t\t10 MBps is equal to 83.886080 Mbps\r\n\t Sample task: convert 10 MB/s (SI) to Mbps. Solution:  \nFormula:\r\n\t\tMBps * 8 = Mbps\nCalculation:\r\n\t\t10 MBps * 8 = 80 Mbps\nEnd result:\r\n\t\t10 MBps is equal to 80 Mbps\r\n\t [1] IEC 60027-2, Second edition, 2000-11, Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology - Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics.

So 5 GHz comes into the picture, It is new, and not commonly used, and because it is used by fewer devices there is no signal crowding and interference. The 2.4 GHz transmits data at a slower speed than 5 GHz but does have a longer range than 5 GHz. The 5 GHz transmits data at a faster rate, but it has a shorter range because it has a higher frequency. 2.4 GHz 5 GHz Comparatively Low High High Comparatively low Different standards of Wi-Fi :These are the Wi-Fi standards that evolved from 1997 to 2021.

The reason I have rated the phone 4 stars is the phone was originally based in India or South Africa . One of the down loaded apps is African and South Africa news and some other apps are Indian based.  Other than these, I really like the phone. It is the right size for the shirt pocket, it holds a charge for a long time and once you get used to it, it is easy to use.  I was really excited about using the google assistant, but once I added a weather app and some others, I don't use it very much. I don't use any social accounts so the phone having face book and twitter doesn't excite me. Also I don't text so I have no complaints about that. The phone makes calls which it does well and I can hear and be heard and that is what is important. The rest is icing on the cake. \nVerified purchase:\nYes\n | \nCondition:\npre-owned\n | \nSold by:\npetercell\n It's perfectly fine.  Longtime flip phone user here. Product came in new condition as described. This does everything I want a flip phone to do and then some, but it isn't without quirks. The predictive texting on this phone feels years behind the standard T9 that was so common on phones in the 2000s and into the 2010s. For example: contractions aren't in the dictionary and are difficult to add. You're better off saying can not in stead of can't. Also, punctuation is sloppy. To add a period, you can't simply press 1, you must press * to open the symbol menu and select a period. One nice feature is the talk to text feature. It's capable of capturing fairly complex sentences and getting them right most of the time. Calls sound clear. There is a bit of lag when you type or enter a number (noticeable, but not too bad). When the phone auto-updated the time for daylight savings time, it correctly updated the time on the front screen of the phone, but didn't update the large clock display on the phone's main screen, so I had to turn the large main screen clock off in the menu. There is a very small clock display in the upper right corner of the main screen that is correct. Overall, it's good. It does the things, and if you want to have a smart phone you can go get one, but if flip phones are your thing, this will probably do what you want with an occasional minor annoyance that won't bother you too badly because you wouldn't be buying a flip phone if you really really cared about functionality.    \nVerified purchase:\nYes\n | \nCondition:\nnew\n | \nSold by:\nyumnatel08\n Does what I need...more features than I want. Screen too small for internet - youtube viewing KaiOS is right. It's got more apps and data burning functions than I wanted.  Like another review above wrote, you'll need to get AT&T to lock out the internet and youtube stuff to prevent unwanted charges ..phone and text is ALL I need and the  texting is bad...no reply feature and the next word guess feature can't be turned off and is a big problem when all I want is to type a short message. The display only lets you put wallpaper and the clock on. Won't let me remove internet icons from screen.  Very few positive features for my uses.  Bigger key pad \nVerified purchase:\nYes\n | \nCondition:\npre-owned\n | \nSold by:\ncph2020\n overall very nice phone foe the moneyu Overall nice phone for the money.Howewver some features very difficult to manuver around,even for my techi son.Mice size and screen Love the voice call command \nVerified purchase:\nYes\n | \nCondition:\npre-owned\n | \nSold by:\nvipoutlet\n Really good choice for the non-smartphone user Bought this for my mom, who doesn't use smartphones. The 4052R is super easy to set up and use, has large, easy-to-press buttons and nice, readable displays. It has a decently solid feel to it, so it should survive the occasional fall. We upgraded from an older Alcatel flip phone and I could instantly hear a big improvement in the call quality. Battery life seems very good so far and I like that the 4052R supports 4G. AT&T branded, but using it on Cricket (which uses AT&T's network) with absolutely no issues. Really good prices on these now, too. \nVerified purchase:\nYes\n | \nCondition:\nnew\n | \nSold by:\npartlogics\n We got your report We\u2019ll take a look and remove the review if it doesn\u2019t follow our guidelines."], "https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/3050-mah-battery.html": [" (1601 products available) TOP Haven't found the right supplier yet ?

Thank you!"], "https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/input": [" Now you know how to call functions, use variables, create functions, and use  if statements. You also know how to modify variables over time to create animations, and you\u2019ve seen that Processing gives you predefined variables like width and height. You also know that Processing automatically calls the setup function once at the very beginning of the program, and then calls the draw function 60 times per second. So far your programs have mostly done stuff on their own, without responding to anything that the user does. This tutorial shows you how to get user input (things like mouse position, mouse clicks, and keyboard typing) to make your programs more interactive. Processing provides mouseX and mouseY variables that hold the current location of the mouse cursor in the window. Processing automatically updates these variables, so you can use them in the draw function to get the position of the mouse. This program draws a circle wherever the mouse cursor is.  \n\t\tSee the Pen  by Happy Coding (@KevinWorkman) on CodePen.\n\t\t The mouseX and mouseY variables point to int values that hold the current position of the mouse. Similarly, the mousePressed variable points to a boolean value that\u2019s true when the mouse is pressed, and false when it\u2019s not. You can use the mousePressed variable in an if statement to do stuff when the mouse is held down: This program uses an if statement to check whether mousePressed is true. If it is, then it draws a green background. If not, then it draws a gray background.  In other words, the program displays gray unless the mouse is pressed, then it displays green. You can combine the mousePressed variable with the mouseX and mouseY variables to create a drawing program: This program uses an if statement to check whether mousePressed is true. If it is, then it draws an ellipse at mouseX,mouseY.  In other words, the program lets you draw with circles whenever the mouse is pressed. This works because the code does not call the background function from the draw function, so new circles are drawn on top of old circles. \n\t\tSee the Pen  by Happy Coding (@KevinWorkman) on CodePen.\n\t\t The mousePressed variable is useful when you want to do something continuously, as long as the user has the mouse pressed. But what if you want to detect one-time input like a mouse click? These one-time inputs are called events, and Processing provides a bunch of functions that it automatically calls whenever an event happens. By writing code inside these functions, you can run code when these events happen. There are a bunch of mouse input functions that allow you to react to more specific events: Here\u2019s an example that defines mousePressed, mouseReleased, and mouseDragged functions to change the background color: The program starts out gray. When the user presses their mouse, it turns green, and then turns yellow when the user releases their mouse. The program turns blue when the user drags their mouse.  \n\t\tSee the Pen  by Happy Coding (@KevinWorkman) on CodePen.\n\t\t Inside an event function, you can use the same variables and functions as you can in the draw function. Here\u2019s an example that uses the mouseX and mouseY variables inside the mouseClicked function: Inside the draw function (which is called 60 times per second), this code checks the mousePressed variable and draws a small cyan circle under the mouse if it is. Inside the mouseClicked function (which is called once when the user clicks their mouse), the code draws a large green circle under the mouse. In other words, the user can hold down their mouse to draw a small cyan circle, or they can click their mouse to draw a large green circle  \n\t\tSee the Pen  by Happy Coding (@KevinWorkman) on CodePen.\n\t\t Similar to how the mousePressed variable is true whenever the user is pressing a mouse button, the keyPressed variable is true whenever the user is pressing a key on the keyboard. You can use the keyPressed variable in an if statement to execute code whenever the user is pressing a key: This program uses an if statement to check whether the keyPressed variable is true. If so, then it draws a green background, otherwise, it draws a gray background.  In other words, the program shows green whenever the user presses a key. The keyPressed variable by itself is useful if you want to know whether any key is pressed. Many programs will also want to know which key is being pressed. For that, you can use the key variable. The key variable is a char type. If you haven\u2019t seen the char type yet, it\u2019s similar to the String type, except it only holds a single character. You can use char values by typing a single character inside single quotation marks '', like this: The key variable points to a char value that holds the last key that was pressed. You can use it directly: This program passes the key variable into the text() function to draw the last key typed by the user.  \n\t\tSee the Pen  by Happy Coding (@KevinWorkman) on CodePen.\n\t\t Or you can use the key variable in an if statement to detect particular key presses: This program uses an if statement to check whether keyPressed is true. If so, then it uses another if / else-if block to check whether they key is r, g, or b. Depending on which key is pressed, it draws a different color background. If keyPressed is false, then it doesn\u2019t bother checking the key variables and draws a gray background.  \n\t\tSee the Pen  by Happy Coding (@KevinWorkman) on CodePen.\n\t\t Notice that the code only checks the key variable if it knows that keyPressed is true. This is because key always holds the most recent key pressed by the user, even if the user stopped pressing it. Challenge: Modify this code so the color change remains, even when the user releases the key. They key variable is useful if you want to check for letter or number keys. But what if you want to check for the shift or ctrl key, or the arrow keys? They don\u2019t have char representations, so the key variable won\u2019t work with them. Instead, you can use the keyCode variable. You can check the keyCode variable against predefined variables like UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, SHIFT, CONTROL, and ALT (There are more, check the reference!) to do stuff when the user presses a specific key. This program checks whether one of the arrow keys is being pressed, and moves a circle based on that. This allows the user to move the circle around the screen.  \n\t\tSee the Pen  by Happy Coding (@KevinWorkman) on CodePen.\n\t\t Challenge: Modify this code to make the circle go faster! The keyPressed, key, and keyCode variables are useful if you want to do something continuously, as long as the user presses a key. But what if you want to respond to one-time keyboard events? Similar to how Processing automatically calls the mousePressed(), mouseReleased(), and mouseClicked() functions based on mouse events, Processing also automatically calls the keyPressed(), keyReleased(), and keyTyped() functions based on keyboard events. You can define these functions to run code based on these keyboard events. This program maintains a message variable. In the keyTyped function, it appends the typed key to the message variable. The draw function draws the message to the screen.  The key and keyCode variables only hold the most recent key pressed. This limits you to only knowing about one key at a time. But what if the user is holding down multiple keys at the same time? One approach to track multiple keys involves four steps: This code uses four boolean values to hold whether any of the arrow keys are pressed. In the keyPressed function, the corresponding variable is set to true, and in the keyReleased function, the corresponding variable is set to false. Then the draw function uses those variables to move the circle depending on which arrow keys are currently pressed.  \n\t\tSee the Pen  by Happy Coding (@KevinWorkman) on CodePen.\n\t\t If this seems confusing, think about exactly what happens when you press two keys at the same time: it might seem like you\u2019re pressing them at the same time, but you\u2019re actually pressing one a split second before the other. Same with releasing them. This program shows a bunch of the variables and event functions you can use to get user input: Notice that it doesn\u2019t really make sense to display the value of some of these variables (like keyCode or mouseButton). It only makes sense to compare them to other preexisting variables (like SHIFT or LEFT). Make a random bouncing ball pit. Randomly colored random walkers. Click to add a pumpkin to the patch. Reposition a circle by dragging it around the screen.

Fortunately, there are ways to determine which audio format is best for you.  We\u2019ll be ranking the top 10 audio formats based on the quality to file size ratio, and their playability amongst multiple platforms and operating systems, so read the entire blog to get the information you need to make an informed decision. But first, let\u2019s look into some important distinctions between audio formats, just to make this process a little easier.\u00a0 Audio formats can be categorized into 3 distinct groups.\u00a0 These are Uncompressed, Lossless, and Lossy files.\u00a0 Also, it helps to know the term PCM and how it applies to the different file types. Uncompressed files are the large, uncompressed files often associated with professional audio settings.\u00a0 They have a bit depth and sampling rate of at least 16 bits and 44.1kHz respectively.\u00a0 With that said, you can expect a dynamic range of at least 96 dB, and a frequency spectrum of 22.5kHz.\u00a0 Because these files are not compressed in any way, they accurately represent the master that was created.\u00a0 Due to this, uncompressed files are typically the best for professional audio needs. Lossless files take up slightly less space than an uncompressed file, and ideally present no setbacks or compromises regarding audio quality.\u00a0 Lossless files work by compartmentalizing redundant or repeated data, while providing a \u201cset of instructions\u201d for these parts to be recreated during playback.  As a result, lossless files can be up to 70 percent smaller than an uncompressed file, but still, offer the same quality during playback.\u00a0 A common example of lossless encoding can be seen when using a .zip file.\u00a0 Although a zip file is smaller than the files it is comprised of, when unzipped, all files retain their original file size and information. Lossy files are compressed files, which are created by recognizing information that isn\u2019t perceivable by most listeners and then deleting that information.\u00a0 This is a great option for streaming, or any online service in which speed of service is more important than the quality of the audio. The quality of lossy files range greatly, from almost indiscernible from uncompressed files, to highly compressed files with noticeable aliasing, quantization distortion, and an attenuated high frequency range. Pulse-Code-Modulation is the method with which analog signals are converted into the digital domain.\u00a0 During this process, waveforms are encoded using a sampling rate and a bit depth.\u00a0 The sampling rate represents how many samples are made per second, and the bit depth represents how many bits per sample.\u00a0 Most digital formats are a 24 bit, 44.1kHz. sampling rate. Now that we know the categories audio formats can be organized into, let\u2019s look at the top 10 formats.\u00a0 Again these have been determined by the quality of the audio, the size of the file, and the playability of the file amongst multiple operating systems. But first, if you\u2019re thinking of having your music mastered, send us a mix here: https://www.sageaudio.com/register.php We\u2019ll master it for you and send you a free mastered sample. I know we just said that all audio formats can be categorized by uncompressed, lossless, and uncompressed, but this file is the one outlier to that rule. A DSD file is a high quality format that is encoded in an entirely unique way.\u00a0 Unlike uncompressed files that use a sampling rate and bit depth, DSD files use only 1 bit, but samples that bit 2.8 million times a second to recreate the audio file. The result is very similar to that of a 24 bit, 96kHz. uncompressed file.\u00a0 Although incredibly innovative and of truly great sound quality, the DSD ranks low on this list due to how incompatible is it with most operating systems.\u00a0 To play a DSD file on a mac or windows computer, you would need an external D to A converter. This means that if you intend to send music to clients, or maybe send in your files for mastering, sending a DSD file would be a confusing and complex struggle for everyone involved. If you have the money to spend on the external converter, and you are sold that sampling 1 bit 2.8 million times per second is better than sampling 24 bits 96,000 times per second than the DSD format is for you. If you want to learn more about mastering digitally, and how the sampling rate and bit depth tie into this, here is a blog on the topic: What is Digital Mastering? The Ogg Vorbis is a unique lossy file format, that doesn\u2019t get mentioned too often due to not being associated with a major operating system.\u00a0 It\u2019s an open-source format that offers a high audio quality to file size ratio, due to being exceptionally well designed \u2013 the file size for an Ogg Vorbis file ranges from 16kbps to 128kbps per file.\u00a0 Despite being capable of delivering good audio quality at a fraction of the storage space of other lossy files, the Ogg Vorbis has yet to the reach wide acceptance.\u00a0 Although the open-source platform results in a great community, offering innovative ideas \u2013 relying on this community for the playability of your files may be concerning to some engineers. When you couple this with the fact that Ogg Vorbis files are not supported natively and require software extensions to be playable on most devices, the Ogg Vorbis doesn\u2019t seem like a go-to format for most engineers. However, Spotify has surprisingly adopted the Ogg format for their streaming services.\u00a0 With that said, if you\u2019re looking to hear how your music will sound on Spotify, converting it to an Ogg Vorbis file will give you a good idea. If you want to learn more about mastering for Spotify or other streaming services, check out our blog on the topic: Master Music for Streaming. The WMA \u2018lossless\u2019 format shares the same name as the WMA \u2018lossy\u2019 format, so to keep things clear, we\u2019re discussing the lossless format here.\u00a0 WMA stands for Windows Media Audio, and as that name may suggest, it was developed by Microsoft to be the primary lossless file format for their Windows operating system. This lossless format can handle files up to 24-bit depth and 96kHz. sampling rate, and reproduce them without deleting data; however, the compression algorithm used when compressing the file is less effective and takes up more space than other lossless formats.\u00a0 Furthermore, it\u2019s difficult to find support for the WMA lossless format, aside from the windows media player.\u00a0 That being said, if you were to send a WMA lossless file to a Mac owner or an apple device user, they\u2019d most likely be unable to play the files unless they converted it first. Unless you and your clients strictly use windows hardware and software, then this may not be the file type for you.\u00a0 If you are a window\u2019s operating system user, and you need a way to cut down on some of your stored back-up files, the WMA lossless format would be a great option for this. Originally touted to be the superior lossy file format, the WMA lossy has since lost some of the initial excitement surrounding it.\u00a0 Objectively, it does offer better audio quality than some of the other lossy file formats, like the MP3, but not enough to be noticed by most listeners. Just like the WMA Lossless format, it doesn\u2019t translate well to other operating systems, meaning it can only be played on window devices.\u00a0 Again, if you own a window\u2019s computer, and you\u2019re looking to cut back on some of your file sizes, the WMA lossy format can give you higher quality than an MP3, with a similar amount of compression.\u00a0 With that in mind, the cons of not being able to share this file type to an Apple user, definitely outweighs any minor benefit in audio quality the WMA lossy offers. The ALAC format is often thought of as Apple\u2019s Lossless audio file format.\u00a0 Although it was originally designed solely for use with Apple products, the coding for ALAC became open-source in 2011 \u2013 meaning that encoders can be used to make ALAC files easily playable or convertible on other operating systems. Like the lossless WMA file previously mentioned (number 8 on our list), the ALAC compresses the audio, but does not discard information \u2013 instead it categorizes redundant information, and unpacks it when needed.\u00a0 Unlike the lossless WMA format, the ALAC supports files with a bit depth of up to 32 bits and a sampling rate of up to 384kHz. This makes it a great option for anyone looking for a better way to store extremely high quality files.\u00a0 The only issue with the file, is the inability for all listeners to instantly play it, regardless of their PC or Mac preference. But again, if you\u2019re a Mac user, and you have some truly large files that are eating a hole in your storage, the ALAC format is a great choice The MP3 is probably the most popular audio file format on this list.\u00a0 Often times, the terms MP3 and audio file are used interchangeably, regardless of whether the format being used is actually an MP3. The MP3\u2019s popularity is primarily due to its versatility.\u00a0 If you\u2019d listened to music, regardless of the device, you\u2019ve almost certainly listened to an MP3. Regardless of the platform, the operating system, or software, an MP3 will most likely play \u2013 making it a great choice for anyone looking to have their music instantly playable. Of course, with this flexibility there is a downside \u2013 the MP3 is of course a lossy format, but unlike the compression used by other lossy formats, the MP3 is pretty unforgiving with what it chooses to delete. The being said, an MP3\u2019s lack of quality can easily be noticed when comparing it to a higher quality file.\u00a0 If you\u2019re willing to sacrifice quality for small file size, ease of use, and streamibility then the MP3 is a great file format for you. But, if you\u2019d prefer to come across as professional in your file delivery, then an MP3 should only be included with a higher quality format.\u00a0 In this regard, providing an MP3 to a client is more of a courtesy than actually delivering the final mix or master. If you\u2019re curious how different MP3 files compare, check out our blog titled \u201cWhat File Type Should I Sent for Mastering?\u201d where we use a null test to recognize the difference between WAV, 128kbps MP3 files, and 320kbps MP3 files. The AAC lossy file format came out soon after the MP3, and with the intention of becoming a better, more popular version of its predecessor. Although it did manage to become the better format, it never did match the MP3\u2019s popularity.\u00a0 Regardless, the AAC file format is a great choice for creating and sending small compressed files.\u00a0 It\u2019s supported on just about as many platforms as the MP3 but supports a much more complex compression algorithm, which means less information is deleted, and less relevant information is deleted. This means that the AAC offers a higher quality than the MP3, at a very similar file size.\u00a0 Considering it can be played in almost as many ways as the MP3, the AAC is currently the best lossy file format available. The FLAC lossless file offers the highest quality to file size ratio of any file formats on this list.\u00a0 It can recreate files as large as 32 bits and a 192kHz sampling rate, all while being able to reduce its size by up to 70% in some cases. That\u2019s impressive, considering how much storage space files of that size can take up.\u00a0 Although FLAC is not supported by iTunes, it is supported by QuickTime, the software used to quickly preview files on Apple operating systems. This means that regardless of being a PC or an Apple user, FLAC files can be sent, received and played without the need for conversion or third-party software.\u00a0 With that in mind, the FLAC format is a go-to choice for anyone looking to send lossless compressed audio files.  The AIFF uncompressed file format is the professional file used on Apple\u2019s software.\u00a0 This means its a PCM or a Pulse-Code Modulation format that doesn\u2019t compress or delete the audio in any way. You may notice that when recording in Logic, AIFF is one of your two choices.\u00a0 Both WAV files and AIFF files represent the highest quality possible in the audio world \u2013 they are the files of choice for any mixing or mastering engineer looking to retain the highest quality possible.  The only reason the AIFF file didn\u2019t make the top of this list is that it is not as well known as its window\u2019s counterpart.\u00a0  Despite the fact that AIFF files will play on windows operating systems, many people don\u2019t know what it is.\u00a0 This may be due to the fact that it was once exclusive to Apple devices, or maybe because PCs were the first choice of early digital audio engineers. Regardless, the AIFF file is identical to the WAV file in terms of quality, just not in acclaim. This brings us to the number 1 spot, the WAV uncompressed audio format.\u00a0 As you may already know, the WAV is the go-to file type for recording, mixing, and mastering.\u00a0 It has little limitation on the potential bit depth and sampling rate, although, at a certain point, you don\u2019t really need a sampling rate higher than 48kHz. Also, it is widely recognized as the professional audio format.\u00a0 This means that the majority of uploads, be it to Apple Music, Spotify, or any streaming service will support and sometimes even demand a WAV file.\u00a0 If you\u2019re looking for a format that doesn\u2019t compromise on quality, and is widely recognized as the best, most professional file format then the WAV file format is your best bet. Granted, you don\u2019t save space with a WAV file, but if you\u2019re working in a professional setting, be it video or audio, the odds are you\u2019ve extended your storage space, to work with the best file types available.\u00a0 Conclusion: Although this list does look at the technical factors behind which audio format is best, we recognize that personal preference goes a long way in determining what is best for you. Keep in mind your operating system, your storage space, and how you\u2019d like to be perceived when exporting and sending files. Although it\u2019s nice to save storage space, it shouldn\u2019t come at the expensive of audio quality, or your image as a professional engineer. If you stick with WAV or AIFF files, and offer an MP3 or perhaps another lossy file type for your clients to listen to just as a courtesy, you\u2019re ahead of most other engineers in terms of customer service. Use this list as a reference whenever you have a question about a particular file type, or maybe a client doesn\u2019t know the difference between the PCM file and the lossy file you sent them.\u00a0 Knowing the different file types, which are best to send, and which may be best to use only for personal preference can help make you a consistent and reliable engineer.

Predictions are based on the context of other words in the message and the first letters typed. The user simply taps on a word instead of typing it out on a computer keyboard or mobile device's soft keyboard. Predictive text can significantly speed up the input process. Predictive text uses machine learning to curate a glossary of words and phrases that a user often types. The predictive text feature then ranks these commonly used words and phrases to guess when they will be used again. One of the earliest applications for predictive text was T9 (text on 9 keys). T9 was invented in 1995 and made typing on mobile phones and other small devices easier. Prior to T9, typing on a mobile device required multitapping, where the user had to tap numbers up to four times to register letter characters. T9 improved the mobile user experience by associating groups of letters on each phone key with words in a dictionary. Software in the device correlated sequences of key presses with words in the dictionary and prioritized predictions by frequency of use. Although predictive text technologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated, the software is still notoriously error-prone. Erroneous predictive text input on Apple devices is sometimes referred to as the Cupertino effect. The name was inspired by the way early spell checkers would change the word cooperation to Cupertino, which just happens to be the city in California where Apple has its corporate headquarters. Some examples of predictive text systems for mobile devices are the following: There are also many applications of predictive text outside of mobile messaging apps. Some examples include: Predictive text uses machine learning to guess a writer's next word based on their writing style. As the user types, the machine learning algorithm notes commonly used words and creates a personalized dictionary. The algorithm makes repeated observations and becomes attuned to the user's style. It also notes of the last few words the user wrote and narrows its suggestion based on those words. This is known as context-sensitive text prediction. Predictive text uses language models to understand written input and make recommendations. Language models, such as Open AI's GPT-3, are used by search engines, behavioral marketers for sentiment analysis, content generation tools and chatbots. Predictive text makes messaging or writing more efficient. It can also act as a spell check device in text messaging. The first step in using predictive text is to enable it on the user's mobile device. On iPhones, predictive text is enabled by default. If it is off, do the following to enable it: When predictive text is turned on and a user starts to type, a bar above the keyboard will display suggested words and phrases. The user can click a suggested word as it appears in the suggestion bar to add it to the message. For example, a user types the word happy and the strip displays the words birthday, bday and holidays as suggestions for the next word. If a user is in the process of typing happy and has typed the letters hap, the suggestions might be happy, happened and happiness to complete the word. In some cases, predictive text will suggest emojis when a word is typed. For example, if the user types fire, a fire emoji is suggested alongside text suggestions. If the user types happy, a happy face emoji will be suggested. On Android devices, Gboard predictive text is usually enabled by default. If it isn't turned on, Android users can follow these steps: Gmail's Smart Compose predictive text feature is slightly different on a laptop or desktop computer from predictive text on mobile devices. The user begins to type a word in the body of an email, and Smart Compose finishes the word it thinks is being typed in a lighter font. Smart Compose and its accompanying personalization option are enabled by default in Gmail. To turn Smart Compose on or off follow these steps: Smart Compose also learns from a user's writing style with personalized suggestions. The following four steps will turn personalized suggestions off: To enable predictive text on Microsoft Word follow these steps: Similar to Gmail, users will see suggested text in a lighter font displayed as they type. Turning off predictive text is usually the same steps as turning the function on, but with the opposite final action. The following steps will turn off predictive text in various devices: To turn off the predictive text feature while typing, iPhone users can: Other ways to use predictive text Predictive text can be used to provide shortcuts to insert longer phrases or sentences in text. On iOS, the following steps enable this capability: For example, if the user enters On my way! in the Phrase field, and omw in the Shortcut field, On my way! will appear in the suggestion bar when a user types omw. This approach can be useful for commonly misspelled words as well. For example, a user who is apt to misspell perceived would enter the correct spelling of that word in the Phrase field and the common misspelling percieved in the Shortcut field. When they type percieved, predictive text will suggest perceived. Android's Gboard also has a \"Block Offensive Words\" feature. When enabled, it prevents the predictive text features from suggesting profanity to the user. To remove words from Gboard predictive text, users can: Predictive text is often used in customer service applications to help agents quickly craft responses to customers.

The slower AMD 3015e and 3020e range below and are compared to the Celeron N4120. Therefore, the Athlon 3050e should reach a level of a Pentium N5000 and therefore still positioned in the entry level of CPUs in 2020. It is best suited for light tasks.\r More information on Raven Ridge can be found in our launch article.\r Power consumption  Much like Intel's N-class Celeron and Pentium processors, AMD's 3050e has a 6 W TDP (also known as the long-term power limit). This CPU is built on a 14 nm process making for subpar energy efficiency. In the following list you can select (and also search for) devices that should be added to the comparison.

It is manufactured in a 28 nm process and consists of four CPU cores based on the 64-bit Cortex-A53 architecture clocked at up to 1.35 GHz (MT6737T up to 1.5 GHz). The GPU is an ARM Mali-720 MP2. It integrates a Cat.4 LTE modem with CDMA200 as well as a video de- and encoder for 1080p30 videos (H.264 and H.265).\r\nProcessor \nThe Cortex-A53 is the successor to the popular Cortex-A7 design. In addition to the jump from 32-bit to 64-bit architecture (ARMv8 ISA) to address more than 4 GB of memory, the new design offers better branch prediction and higher performance-to-power ratio that rivals the Cortex-A9. The four cores of the MT6737 are clocked at up to 1.35 GHz and are roughly on par with the Snapdragon 410 (4x Cortex-A53 at 1.2 to 1.4 GHz). The processor is fit for common tasks like browsing and running light applications.\r\nGraphics \nThe integrated\u00a0single-core Mali-T720\u00a0is an entry-level GPU clocked between 550-650 MHz for the MT6737 (or 600 for the MT6737T).

Because the user simply taps on a word instead of typing it out on the keyboard, predictive text can significantly speed up the input process. Data collection: The original data was provided by the Swiftkey dataset from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip Data sampling: There original dataset is over 500Mb with more than 100 milion that makes the processing too slow. For that reason, and for equipment speed reasons, the data was randomly sampled to obtain a 20% of the original dataset size. Corpus processing: A corpus was created from the sampled data. From the corpus were removed numbers, punctuation, special characters, non appropriate words and leading and trailing whitespace. Also, every string element was transformed to lower case. N-Gram Models: N-Gram models were created. This means that the most frequent \"n\" consecutive words are looked for in the corpus and these are stated as the best options. Then, when the text is evaluated the last \"n-1\" words are collected. These words are anaylzed and the best coincidences are returned with the \"n\" word from the model. N-gram models were created for \"n = 1,2,3,4,5\". Final N-Gram Models: There is a trade off between speed and precision of the models, for speeding up the action of response, only the best 10% options of every model was used for the app deployment. \nThe models obtained before were integrated into a web app in Shiny. The app contains a central text input area and the best three suggestions are shown below.  \nThe app will read the text inside the text input area and predict the three most suitable options.

Millions of Verizon customers enjoy the consistently fast speed and incredible coverage of our 4G LTE network every day. But most people aren\u2019t familiar with the technology that powers that network, how 4G LTE is different from other wireless networks, or what the term \u201c4G LTE\u201d actually means. The technology behind 4G may be complex, but we can help you understand the basics. So let\u2019s take a look at what 4G LTE is and why it matters to you. To put it simply, 4G LTE is a term used to describe the type of wireless technology that powers Verizon\u2019s nationwide network, the largest and most reliable wireless network in the United States. Whenever you\u2019re using wireless data on your Verizon device \u2013 whether you\u2019re downloading, streaming, surfing the web or checking email \u2013 and you see \u201cLTE\u201d light up at the top of your screen, you\u2019re using 4G LTE. And what does \u201c4G LTE\u201d stand for? 4G LTE is short for \u201cfourth generation long-term evolution.\u201d So it\u2019s actually two terms combined. First, \u201c4G\u201d represents the fourth generation of mobile technology, the next big advancement after 3G. And \u201clong-term evolution,\u201d or \u201cLTE,\u201d is industry jargon used to describe the particular type of 4G that delivers the fastest mobile internet experience. So with a network like Verizon\u2019s, you\u2019re getting the best of both worlds when it comes to using wireless data \u2013 4G and LTE. You probably know that 4G LTE is \u201cfast.\u201d But what does that actually mean when it comes to using your phone? It means downloads 10 times faster than with 3G. It means webpages that load in an instant. It means smoother video and music streaming. In short, 4G LTE gives us the ability to utilize and experience the internet in a quicker, richer way. By enabling video viewing and data sharing at a pace not realized before, LTE has turned our smartphones into powerful connected devices that we can carry anywhere. And it\u2019s opened up new possibilities for both our personal and professional lives. Whether you\u2019re skimming reviews to find a great new restaurant, using GPS to find your way there, or streaming videos on YouTube while you wait for your food to arrive, 4G LTE lets you do it all \u2013 seamlessly. Download speeds on 4G LTE Individual emails A webpage An entire e-book An MP3 file Yes, there really were three generations of wireless networking technology before 4G. The first generation of mobile technology, which came to be known as 1G, was introduced in the 1980s. An analog technology, it gave us the ability to make and receive calls on mobile phones. The advent of 2G digital technology in the early 1990s introduced text messaging. The move to 3G in 2004 provided network speeds fast enough for the first smartphones. Finally, 4G, with its incredibly fast data-transfer rates, gave rise to many of the connected devices and services that we rely on and enjoy today.  3G 4G LTE Download speeds Slow \u2013 Over 30 seconds for larger apps  Fast \u2013 Larger files take just a few seconds Web browsing Slow and clunky Fast and seamless; similar to the home broadband experience Video & music streaming Poor quality, with frequent buffering HD quality, live video Verizon launched its 4G LTE network on December 5, 2010. It was the world\u2019s first large-scale 4G LTE network, covering 38 major metropolitan areas and more than one-third of all Americans at launch. From there, Verizon worked feverishly to expand the new network to every corner of the United States. By October 2012, Verizon 4G LTE wireless was available in over 400 U.S. markets. And by 2013, LTE reached 97 percent of the U.S. population. In 2016, Verizon became the first U.S. provider to deploy LTE Advanced in cities nationwide. LTE Advanced uses carrier aggregation to speed mobile data over the network more quickly than ever before, providing customers with 50 percent faster peak speeds. Today, more than 98 percent of the U.S. population has access to 4G LTE and 90 percent of Verizon Wireless\u2019 data traffic is carried over the network. Verizon launched the first large-scale 4G LTE network on December 5, 2010. In 2016, Verizon became the first U.S. provider to deploy LTE Advanced in cities nationwide.\u00a0 Since the launch of LTE in 2010, Verizon has consistently invested in network infrastructure and implemented the latest technology to improve coverage and throughput speeds. By investing in small cells, deploying Massive MIMO, implementing carrier aggregation and adding new bandwidth, we\u2019ve successfully increased the speed and reliability of the nation\u2019s leading 4G network again and again. With this continual improvement, it\u2019s no wonder Verizon\u2019s 4G LTE network consistently wins award, after award, after award for being the nation\u2019s best network. Technology isn\u2019t slowing down and neither are we. Verizon continues to be at the forefront of 4G networking technology. Here are just some of the recent 4G LTE milestones and firsts Verizon\u2019s network engineers have achieved by working with our technology partners: Despite all those industry acronyms, the end goal of each of these efforts is simple: to make our 4G LTE network even faster and more reliable for our customers, even as more and more devices come online. Verizon continues to innovate with 4G LTE while\u00a0leading the industry\u00a0in the development of 5G. While Verizon continues to make improvements to its 4G LTE network, we\u2019re busy leading the industry in the development of 5G. If 4G was a game changer for the way we use wireless, 5G will be downright revolutionary. The low latency and massive bandwidth of 5G will allow for autonomous cars, smart communities, immersive experiences in augmented reality (AR) and the explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT) \u2013 all things that just weren\u2019t possible before, even with the fantastic speed of 4G LTE. But that doesn\u2019t mean that 4G is going away. In fact, Verizon expects its 4G LTE network to be its mainstay for some time to come. 5G will be rolled out incrementally, city by city, and live alongside 4G LTE for the foreseeable future.

Touchpads are a common feature of laptop computers as opposed to using a mouse on a desktop, and are also used as a substitute for a mouse where desk space is scarce. Because they vary in size, they can also be found on personal digital assistants (PDAs) and some portable media players. Wireless touchpads are also available as detached accessories.\n Touchpads operate in one of several ways, including capacitive sensing or resistive touchscreen. The most common technology used in the 2010s senses the change of capacitance where a finger touches the pad. Capacitance-based touchpads will not sense the tip of a pencil or other similar ungrounded or non-conducting implements. Fingers insulated by a glove may also be problematic, and capacitive touchpads are rarely used as pointing devices for medical hardware. [1]\n While touchpads, like touchscreens, are able to sense absolute position, resolution is limited by their size. For common use as a pointer device, the dragging motion of a finger is translated into a finer, relative motion of the cursor on the output to the display on the operating system, analogous to the handling of a mouse that is lifted and put back on a surface.  Hardware buttons equivalent to a standard mouse's left and right buttons are sometimes positioned adjacent to the touchpad.\n Some touchpads and associated device driver software may interpret tapping the pad as a mouse click, and a tap followed by a continuous pointing motion (a \"click-and-a-half\") can indicate dragging.[2] Tactile touchpads allow for clicking and dragging by incorporating button functionality into the surface of the touchpad itself.[3][4] To select, one presses down on the touchpad instead of a physical button.  To drag, instead of performing the \"click-and-a-half\" technique, the user presses down while on the object, drags without releasing pressure, and lets go when done. Touchpad drivers can also allow the use of multiple fingers to emulate the other mouse buttons (commonly two-finger tapping for the center button).\n Touchpads are called clickpads if it does not have physical buttons, but instead relies on \"software buttons\". Physically the whole clickpad formed a button, logically the driver interprets a click as a left or right button click depending on the placement of fingers.[5]\n Some touchpads have \"hotspots\", locations on the touchpad used for functionality beyond a mouse. For example, on certain touchpads, moving the finger along an edge of the touch pad will act as a scroll wheel, controlling the scrollbar and scrolling the window that has the focus, vertically or horizontally.  Many touchpads use two-finger dragging for scrolling.  Also, some touchpad drivers support tap zones, regions where a tap will execute a function, for example, pausing a media player or launching an application. All of these functions are implemented in the touchpad device driver software, and can be disabled.\n By 1982, Apollo desktop computers were equipped with a touchpad on the right side of the keyboard.[6] Introduced a year later, in 1983, the first battery powered clamshell laptop, the Gavilan SC included a touchpad, which was mounted above its keyboard, rather than below, which became the norm.[7]\n Psion's MC 200/400/600/WORD Series,[8] introduced in 1989, came with a new mouse-replacing input device similar to a touchpad,[9] although more closely resembling a graphics tablet, as the cursor was positioned by clicking on a specific point on the pad, instead of moving it in the direction of a stroke.[10]\n Laptops with touchpads were then launched by Olivetti and Triumph-Adler in 1992.[11] Cirque introduced the first widely available touchpad, branded as GlidePoint, in 1994.[12][13] Apple introduced touchpads with modern placing in the PowerBook 500 series in 1994, using Cirque's GlidePoint technology,[14][15] which Apple refers to as a \"trackpad\"; it replaced the trackball of previous PowerBook models. Since 2008, Apple's revisions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro incorporated a \"Tactile Touchpad\" design with a button integrated into the tracking surface[3][4][16] (the lower part of the touchpad surface acts as a clickable button).[17]\n Another early adopter of the GlidePoint pointing device was Sharp.[12]  Later, Synaptics introduced their touchpad into the marketplace, branded the TouchPad, and Epson was an early adopter of this product with their ActionNote.[12]\n As touchpads began to be introduced in laptops in the 1990s, there was often confusion as to what the product should be called.  No consistent term was used, and references varied, such as: glidepoint, touch sensitive input device, touchpad, trackpad, and pointing device.[18][19][20]\n Users were often presented with the option to purchase a pointing stick, touchpad, or trackball.  Combinations of the devices were common, though touchpads and trackballs were rarely included together.[21] Since the early 2000s, touchpads have become the dominant laptop pointing device as most consumer laptops produced during this period and beyond includes only touchpads, displacing the pointing stick.\n Touchpads are primarily used in self-contained portable laptop computers and do not require a flat surface near the machine. The touchpad is close to the keyboard, and relatively short finger movements are required to move the cursor across the display screen; while advantageous, this also makes it possible for a user's palm or wrist to move the mouse cursor accidentally while typing. Laptops today feature multitouch touchpads that can sense in some cases up to five fingers simultaneously, providing more options for input, such as the ability to bring up the context menu by tapping two fingers, dragging two fingers for scrolling, or gestures for zoom in/out or rotate. The touchpads with physical buttons now are only hi-end business\\professional laptops option.\n One-dimensional touchpads are the primary control interface for menu navigation on iPod Classic portable music players and additional input method on some Wacom digitizer tablets, where they are referred to as \"click wheels\", since they only sense motion along one axis, which is wrapped around like a wheel. Creative Labs also uses a touchpad for their Zen line of MP3 players, beginning with the Zen Touch. The second-generation Microsoft Zune product line (the Zune 80/120 and Zune 4/8) uses touch for the Zune Pad.\n Touchpads also exist for desktop computers as an external peripheral, albeit rarely seen. But touchpad layer can be integrated with graphics tablet as additional input option.\n External computer keyboards can be equipped with integrated touchpads[22] (particularly keyboards oriented for HTPC use), and some keyboards can have only touch input surface instead of hardware buttons (a typical solution for clean rooms).[23]\n Optical trackpads primary can be used as part of ultraportable electronics; some handheld laptops and early smartphones can be equipped with optical trackpads.\n There are two principal means by which touchpads work.[citation needed] In the matrix approach, a series of conductors are arranged in an array of parallel lines in two layers, separated by an insulator and crossing each other at right angles to form a grid.  A high frequency signal is applied sequentially between pairs in this two-dimensional grid array.  The current that passes between the nodes is proportional to the capacitance. When a virtual ground, such as a finger, is placed over one of the intersections between the conductive layer some of the electrical field is shunted to this ground point, resulting in a change in the apparent capacitance at that location. This method received U.S. Patent 5,305,017 awarded to George Gerpheide in April 1994.\n The capacitive shunt method, described in an application note by manufacturer Analog Devices,[24] senses the change in capacitance between a transmitter and receiver that are on opposite sides of the sensor. The transmitter creates an electric field which oscillates at 200\u2013300\u00a0kHz. If a ground point, such as the finger, is placed between the transmitter and receiver, some of the field lines are shunted away, decreasing the apparent capacitance. \n Trackpads such as those found in some Blackberry smartphones work optically, like an optical computer mouse.\n Major manufacturers include:[citation needed]\n"], "https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-1-25ghz-quad-core-mediatek-mt6737-processor.html": [" Welcome to AliExpress!

Windows Internals 7th edition (Part 1) covers the architecture and core internals of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. This book helps you: The 7th edition was written by Pavel Yosifovich, Alex Ionescu, Mark Russinovich and David Solomon. New material has been added since the 6th edition (which covered Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2). The 7th edition\u2019s part 2 (written by Andrea Allievi, Mark E. Russinovich, Alex Ionescu and David A. Solomon) is now available, and provides an invaluable resource on missing topics from the first part of the 7th edition. These include the boot process, new storage technologies, and Windows system and management mechanisms. The book is available for purchase on the Microsoft Press site (7th edition Part 1; 7th Edition Part 2). This is the seventh edition of a book that was originally called Inside Windows NT (Microsoft Press, 1992), written by Helen Custer (prior to the initial release of Microsoft Windows NT 3.1). Inside Windows NT was the first book ever published about Windows NT and provided key insights into the architecture and design of the system. Inside Windows NT, Second Edition (Microsoft Press, 1998) was written by David Solomon. It updated the original book to cover Windows NT 4.0 and had a greatly increased level of technical depth.\nInside Windows 2000, Third Edition (Microsoft Press, 2000) was authored by David Solomon and Mark Russinovich. It added many new topics, such as startup and shutdown, service internals, registry internals, file-system drivers, and networking. It also covered kernel changes in Windows 2000, such as the Windows Driver Model (WDM), Plug and Play, power management, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), encryption, the job object, and Terminal Services. Windows Internals, Fourth Edition was the Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 update and added more content focused on helping IT professionals make use of their knowledge of Windows internals, such as using key tools from Windows Sysinternals and analyzing crash dumps. Windows Internals, Fifth Edition was the update for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. It saw Mark Russinovich move on to a full-time job at Microsoft (where he is now the Azure CTO) and the addition of a new co-author, Alex Ionescu. New content included the image loader, user-mode debugging facility, Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC), and Hyper-V. The next release, Windows Internals, Sixth Edition, was fully updated to address the many kernel changes in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, with many new hands-on experiments to reflect changes in the tools as well. Since this series\u2019 last update, Windows has gone through several releases, coming up to Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. Windows 10 itself, being the current going-forward name for Windows, has had several releases since its initial Release-to-Manufacturing, or RTM, each labeled with a 4-digit version number indicating year and month of release, such as Windows 10, version 1703 that was completed in March 2017. The above implies that Windows has gone through at least 6 versions since Windows 7.\nStarting with Windows 8, Microsoft began a process of OS convergence, which is beneficial from a development perspective as well as for the Windows engineering team itself. Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 had converged kernels, with modern app convergence arriving in Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1. The convergence story was complete with Windows 10, which runs on desktops/laptops, servers, XBOX One, phones (Windows Mobile 10), HoloLens, and various Internet of Things (IoT) devices.\nWith this grand unification completed, the time was right for a new edition of the series, which could now finally catch up with almost half a decade of changes, in what will now be a more stabilized kernel architecture going forward. As such, this latest book covers aspects of Windows from Windows 8 to Windows 10, version 1703. Additionally, this edition welcomes Pavel Yosifovich as its new co-author.

Though official transition to the standard of the next generation for Wireles 802.11ac will be complete somewhere in 2013, the wireless equipment of the new gigabit standard will be available for sale soon. The new generation of Wi-fi promises to be very interesting. \n Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) is wireless standard 802.11\n\n\n*IEEE 802.11n - Wi-Fi 4\n*IEEE 802.11ad (WiGig)\n\n IEEE 802.3-2012 Standard of Ethernet-networks\n Guide to design and deployment of the wireless equipment \n*IEEE 802.11n - Wi-Fi 4\n*IEEE 802.11ad (WiGig)\n \n the family of standards Wi-Fi 802.11 develops Institute of electrical and electronic engineers and electronics (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, IEEE). The standard provides data transfer rate to 1.1 Gbps and above. The standard provides data transmission for mobile devices on one radio channel with a speed up to 350 Mbps. Such speeds are reached owing to use of broad band of radio frequencies 80 MHz or 160 MHz in the range of 5 GHz, more noise-free in comparison with 2.4 GHz. The IEEE 802.11ac standard was developed for ensuring high capacity of a wireless local area network. It promises gigabit wireless speeds for consumers.\n The original project of technical specification 802.11ac was confirmed by the working group (TGac) last year while ratification of Wi-fi Alliance is expected at the end of this year. In spite of the fact that standard 802.11ac so far in project stage also should be still ratified by Wi-fi Alliance and IEEE, we already begin to see the products of gigabit Wi-Fi available in the market.\n WLAN 802.11ac uses a number of new methods for achievement of a huge gain of performance to theoretically supports the gigabit potential and ensuring high throughputs, such as:\n \n      Multi-user MIMO of low power consumption 802.11ac put new problems for development of the engineers working with the standard. Daley we will discuss these problems and available solutions which will help new product development, based on this standard.\n More wide bandwidth:\n 802.11ac has more wide bandwidth of 80 MHz or even 160 MHz in comparison with previous to 40 MHz in standard 802.11n. More wide bandwidth leads to improvement of the maximum capacity for digital communication systems.\n Among the most difficult tasks of design and production there are a generation and the analysis of signals of wide bandwidth for 802.11ac. Testing of the equipment capable to process 80 or 160 MHz for check of transmitters, receivers and components will be required.\n For generation of 80 MHz of signals, many RF generators of signals have no rather high frequency of sampling for support of a typical minimum 2X resampling ratios which will give as a result necessary images of signals. Using the correct filterings and resampling of a signal from Waveform of the file, it is possible to generate 80 MHz signals with good spectral characteristics and EVM.\n For generation of signals of 160 MHz, with the broad range the generator of wave signals of any form (AWG), such as Agilent 81180A, 8190A can be used for creation of analog I/Q of signals. These signals can be applied to external I/Q. As inputs of the vector generator of signals for frequency conversion of RF. Besides, it is possible to create 160 MHz signals using 80 +80 MHz of the mode supporting standard for creation of two segments 80 MHz in separate MCG or ESG signal generators, having integrated then radio signals.\n MIMO:\n MIMO is use of several antennas for performance improvement of the communication system. You could see some Wi-Fi of access point having more than one antenna which is sticking out of them - these routers use MIMO technology.\n Check of MIMO of constructions is change. Multichannel generation and the analysis of signals also verifications of projects can be used for idea of the capacity of MIMO devices and assistance in troubleshooting.\n Amplifier of Linearity:\n The amplifier of Linearity is characteristic and the amplifier using whom the signal output of the amplifier remains correct to an input signal in process of increase. Really amplifiers of linearity are linear only to a limit after which an exit is saturated.\n There are many methods for improvement of linearity of the amplifier. Digital pre-emphasis is one of such to the technician. Design automation of the software as SystemVue provides the application which simplifies and automates digital design of pre-emphasis for power amplifiers.\n Compatibility with the previous versions\n Though standard 802.11n is used already for many years, still many routers and wireless devices of older protocols 802.11b and 802.11g also work. As well upon transition to 802.11ac, old Wi-Fi standards will be supported and to be provided backward compatibility.\n Gigabit wireless solutions of standard 802.11ac for Wi-Fi of routers and consumer electronics were already presented to consumers at the Electronics Show (CES) exhibition this year.\n It is expected that household appliances will become the first in the market of gigabit wireless devices of standard 802.11ac, and some suppliers, already announced availability of such products.\n Products based on new Wi-Fi of the standard begin to appear in the market. But their quantity is still not enough to justify upgrade of network. The similar situation was observed with standard 802.11n in 2006.\n In the last several months, it was much written about new 802.11ac the standard. The new generation of Wi-fi promises to be very interesting as with 802.11ac, having higher capacity and a connectivity of bigger number of users at the same time, some critical obstacles which users 802.11n face today will be overcome.\n Work on 802.11ac in the range 5GHz offers transmission rate to 1300 Mbit which is ideal for a continuous streaming video of HD and at the same time Internet access. Along with gigabit speeds, 802.11ac products are delivered with the improved opportunities of RF raised by reliability.\n The Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications published the order which approves rules of use of the equipment Wi-Fi of standard 802.11ac and 802.11ad. Department also supports expansion of frequency bands in the range of 5 GHz for use of standard 802.11ac without restrictions, however the State Radio Frequency Commission (SCRF) should make this decision.\n The order of the Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications No. 129 \"About making changes in Rules of use of the equipment of a radio access. Part \u0406. The rules of use of the equipment of a radio access for wireless data transmission in the range from 30 MHz to 66 GHz approved by the order of the Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation of 9/14/2010 No. 124 r\", it was signed by the head of department Nikolai Nikiforov on April 22, 2015 on May 14 the document was registered in Ministry of Justice, and on May 18 it was published on the official Internet portal of legal information \u00d0ravo.gov.ru. The order will become effective 10 days later after the publication.\n Standard 802.11ac works in the frequency range of 5 GHz in frequency bands 5150-5350 MHz, however for operation of radio-electronic devices (distribution zone) of standard 802.11ac without restrictions it is necessary to expand this frequency band.\n The site content is translated by machine translation software powered by PROMT.

The touch-sensitive surfaces replace the computer mouse and the keyboard. Behind all of these simple operations for the user, is a sophisticated technology that combines hardware and software. Let\u2019s take a look at how do the touchpad and touchscreen work? All touchpads have a touch-sensitive surface and a controller that measures the signals and passes them to the operating system. The operating system converts our finger movement into the movement of a mouse and transfers them to the screen. Tapping the surface of the touchpad corresponds to a mouse click, pulling two fingers apart from the center, you can enlarge the image on the screen and with three or four fingers that wipe the surface, pages and images can be scrolled through. The hardware that generates the signals can be based on various physical principles. Resistive touchpads require the pressure that is exerted on the surface by a finger or another object. The touch-sensitive surface of the touchpad consists of two conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) layers, which are separated by small spaces. The lower layer is applied to a firm and stable base, while the upper layer is covered with stretchable polyester from the outside. If you touch the polyester layer, the upper ITO layer is pressed onto the lower one. To determine the position of the pressure point, a DC voltage is alternately applied first on one layer and one millisecond later on the other conductive layer. Since the two layers are briefly connected to each other at the pressure point, a current flows here. The position of the pressure point can then be uniquely determined based on the voltage changes caused there, by the controller. It then forwards the coordinates to the operating system. With this principle, two layers are always necessary for the measurement, one is connected to the voltage, the other transmits the position in one direction. Resistive touchpads are considered pioneers in touch technology but are generally not multi-touch capable. This means that you cannot operate them with multiple fingers. If you press the surface with two or more fingers, only the contact area of the two ITO layers is widened and the fingers cannot be detected individually. The main disadvantage of this technique, however, is that a coordinate is always acquired using the upper, flexible layer. The bending, pressing, and stretching leads to wear and tear in the ITO coating, which changes the electrical properties. Over time, this leads to the fact that the determination of the coordinate becomes less precise. However, resistive touchpads can be manufactured comparatively inexpensively and can be operated with any object. This is particularly important for doctors who often have to operate their medical equipment with rubber gloves. Resistive touchpads are mainly used in older cell phones or in some tablet PCs and in medicine. However, resistive touchpads are now being developed that are also multi-touch capable and are becoming increasingly important in the industry. The principle behind Capacitive touchpads In contrast to resistive technology, capacitive touchpads do not require pressure. They are made up of a two-layer coordinate network of electrodes, which are arranged in one layer as columns and in the other as rows. There is an insulating material between the electrodes called dielectric. A circuit is attached to the lower side, which constantly measures the capacitance at the crossing points of the electrodes. At the top, an insulating protective layer, usually made of glass, ensures that the electrodes are not damaged and the finger can slide well over the surface. This property makes the capacitive touchpad much more robust than the resistive touchpad. Since a finger is electrically conductive, charges can flow off it, as soon as it touches the surface of the touchpad. This changes the electrostatic field between the electrodes and leads to a measurable change in the capacitance. The capacitance changes when the finger moves across the surface which is recorded at the various electrode intersections by a microcontroller. It is forwarded to the operating system that converts these signals into a click or a movement. Capacitive touchpads are multi-touch capable, as they constantly measure the capacity in the entire coordinate network and can register the inputs of individual fingers separately. They differ from resistive touchpads. The disadvantage of the capacitive principle, however, is that only conductive objects can be used, to operate the touchpad. Other objects such as pens, fingernails, or gloves have no effect. The capacitive principle is used for smartphones and tablet PCs and around 99 percent of all laptops also contain capacitive touchpads. Large touchpads on which you can draw with a stylus like on paper or tablet PCs are sometimes based on an inductive principle. However, this requires a special stylus with an integrated coil. This pen influences a circuit board under the touchpad surface, which uses antenna coils to determine the coordinates of the stylus. Also Read \u2013 Spy Apps Installed on 1.4 Billion Devices A somewhat more expensive technique is the use of infrared LEDs, as used in newly developed, very large touchscreens. There, a row of small infrared light-emitting diodes forms a grid of light rays at the edge of the screen, which is read out on the other side with photodetectors. If a finger or another object comes between the LED and the detector, the beam path is interrupted and there is a measurable signal drop at the photosensor. This allows the controller to locate the point of contact and passes it on to a software as a signal. Since the surface of the screen is not coated, this technology offers high light transmission and is very suitable for touch screens.    Your email address will not be published.

All the information you need to help you use UniConverter. A full list of supported formats, devices, and GPUs. The latest product news and updates. Wondershare UniConverter For Windows 7 64-bit or later (32-bit users? Click here) For macOS 10.10 or later (10.7-10.9? Click here) by Kayla Morrison \u2022 2022-11-29 14:45:35 \u2022 Proven solutions Learning how to open OGG file is crucial in many ways. This digital media file format offers super-clear sound quality and is smaller than even the popular MP3. But despite all the benefits, very few programs on Mac and Windows operating systems can directly open OGG files. Luckily, you can install an OGG file opener for desktops to enjoy a smooth OGG file playback. So, this article will show you some top-class multimedia players for desktops. MPlayer is a free, open-source multimedia player app available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Surprisingly, this is 20 years old, but it's still one of the best cross-platform apps today. The multilingual platform is available in Spanish, Polish, Russian, Hungarian, and English. MPlayer can open DVDs, CDs, Blu-ray, and Video CDs. Supported video and audio formats include AVI, MP4, FLV, 3GP, AAC, ALAC, OGG, DTS, and more. Pros: Cons:  VLC Media Player, alias VLC, is another free, open-source app for opening OGG files. With this cross-platform software, you can open OGG files on iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux. It supports multiple media compression methods and formats, including Video CD, DVD, and streaming protocols. On top of allowing you to open an OGG file quickly, VLC also allows users to convert OGG to MP3, FLAC, WAV, and other sound files. Moreover, it comes with an excellent audio recorder. Pros: Cons:  Miro is a video, audio, and internet TV app for macOS, Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD. It offers support for both video and audio formats, some in HD quality. With this free app, you can download clips from RSS-based channels and play them. Examples of supported audio and video formats include MP4, MOV, AVI, MP3, M4A, OGG, and more. You can also convert between video formats. Sadly, the last update was in 2013. Pros: Cons:  MPC-HC is a free, open-source, and lightweight multimedia player for 64-bit and 32-bit Microsoft Windows. It has a simplistic look and provides virtually every feature you'll get in a modern media player. Interestingly, this app is available in more than 30 languages, such as Hebrew, Polish, English, etc. It can play codecs for MP3, MP2, 3GP, DVD, VCD, MP4, and more. Pros: Cons:  Xion Audio Player is an ultra-light and easily skinnable sound player that offers support for multiple audio formats, OGG included. The powerful skinning system is easy to use and offers complete animation support. Also, it provides a 10-band equalizer and effortless playback with crossfading support. The list of supported audio formats is; WMA, OGG, MP3, MOD, FLAC, and more. Pros: Cons:  KMPlayer is a beautiful multimedia player for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows PCs. It's compatible with Android and iOS devices. With it, you can seamlessly open an OGG file and other media files like DVD, VCD, AAC, FLV, OGM, and more. Users can also use KMPlayer to record audios and videos as well as capture screenshots. What's more, you can set many video and audio effects. Pros: Cons:  Finally, you can use this cross-platform app available in 30+ languages to play any media file format. With this Windows OGG file opener, users will get a video/audio equalizer and multiple filters. You can also play audios with variable speed and download configurable subtitles. But more importantly, SMPlayer supports 4K resolution at 60 frames per second, which is rare to find. Add in the skinnable UI, and this app is easily one of the best in the game. Pros: Cons:  Although the above mentioned OGG file opener apps are free, they come with one-dimensional user interfaces that can be boring to use. Even worse, they have limited customization features to help your edit your media files. Fortunately, Wondershare UniConverter has it all. Here, audiophiles can listen to any music file format without any quality loss. Not only that, but it also comes with an audio editor for cutting, merging, changing bitrate, adjusting volume, and more. And above all, Wondershare UniConverter offers an excellent video player and editor. Now apply the following steps to open OGG file and convert it to other sound formats: Run the app and then click the Converter button. Now start dragging and dropping your OGG files on the window. Another way is to tap the Add Files to open your local storage.  Place the mouse cursor on your uploaded OGG file and click the Play icon. Enjoy your music!  When you're done listening to music, close the music player window, and then convert your OGG file to a more universal format like MP3. To do that, open the Output Format menu, choose MP3, select a resolution/bitrate, and then tap the Start All. That's it!  Free Download   Free Download   So, what is the OGG format? Well, OGG is a media container format that's free and open-source to use. Contrary to beliefs, OGG Vorbis can save video, text (subtitle/caption), and metadata on top of audio files. This media file format comes with either .ogg or .ogm filename extension. However, if you want to enjoy seamless playback on any of the above OGG file opener apps, ensure that the filename extension reads .ogg. Conclusion I hope that you've learned a thing or two about how to open an OGG file on Mac or Windows. With the apps above, you'll enjoy free and smooth playback of any media file format. You can also choose Wondershare UniConverter for additional features like a video editor, audio editor, DVD burner, screen recorder, video downloader, and more. So, download it now and have fun! staff Editor Your complete video toolbox \n              Copyright \u00a9\n              \n\n              Wondershare. All rights reserved.

I've played games on my computer for as long as I can remember, which eventually (as it does for many) led me to building and upgrading my own desktop. Through my years here, I've tested and reviewed many, many dozens of laptops and desktops, and I am always happy to recommend a PC for your needs and budget. The Asus VivoBook Flip 14 does a lot right for a convertible laptop, delivering top performance in its price tier, but its build and feature set fall behind some less expensive alternatives. The Asus VivoBook Flip 14 (starts at $599; $699 for our TM420IA-DB71T test model) is an all-around capable convertible laptop powered by AMD. The Ryzen 7 processor in our test model is the laptop's best feature, delivering better performance than its competitors. The VivoBook Flip 14's build is adequate (though not a standout like some alternatives), it includes useful ports, and the battery life is in the ballpark of 10 hours. There are no major flaws here, but the Flip doesn't quite reach the heights of the simply better Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 14. While the Asus does come out on top in performance, there's a good bit of flex in the keyboard deck, its battery doesn't last as long, and it costs $100 more. The latter retains its Editors' Choice, but if you're a performance-first budget shopper, consider the VivoBook Flip 14 too. The construction and design of this laptop's exterior are pleasing enough. The chassis is made of plastic, but it does not feel cheap, while remaining lightweight at 3.31 pounds. The paint is a nice black color with a hue that looks a bit dark-blue in a certain light; officially, it's \"Bespoke Black.\" Black is, as always, slimming.\u00a0 The lightweight design is underpinned by a compact footprint, measuring 0.72 by 12.8 by 8.7 inches (HWD). This combination makes the Flip plenty portable, easy to slip in a bag or carry under your arm to a meeting or between classes. Fitting a 14-inch screen into this size makes it a useful productivity machine once you get where you're going. When you remember how inexpensive the laptop is, it's a nice package overall. The IdeaPad Flex 5 14 is the same weight and a touch thicker, while the HP Envy x360 13 is a tad lighter at 2.9 pounds. The physical shape is supported by some important design features, as well. One of these is the hinges, which allow you to fold this laptop\u2019s screen all the way back into tablet mode, or stop at any point in between. It folds easily, and the hinges are secure. They may be a bit too tight, in fact, as this laptop does not pass the one-finger screen-lift test. You'll have to hold the body down as you pull open the screen from the closed clamshell position, lest you lift the system off the desk. The hybrid design adds a lot of versatility for different use cases, whether used as a tablet to draw or write more easily, held as a tablet in one hand as you move around, or set up with the keyboard facing down and screen pointed toward you for an airplane tray table or a demonstration.\u00a0 The other feature is also related to the hinge, but not the convertibility. Asus' ErgoLift hinge is deployed here, which means the bottom of the lid lifts the keyboard deck off the desk as you open the screen. This creates a slight incline for the keyboard, resulting in a more comfortable typing angle and allowing air to flow better. The latter is more useful in heat-throwing gaming laptops, but the tilt does make typing feel a bit more natural. On that front, the keyboard itself offers a so-so typing experience. The angle certainly helps, but the keys are a touch on the loose side. They lack satisfying feedback, and there's a bit of wiggle room, as well as some flex in the center of the keyboard where it appears to sag slightly when typing.\u00a0 Indeed, unlike the exterior or lid, the keyboard deck as a whole shows some flex with a little pressure, especially above the keyboard. You can tell, in that regard, that this is a less expensive laptop, and it's exaggerated by the fact that the deck is lifted off the desk in that area by the hinge. At least the exterior, where pressure is more likely, is more sturdy. For its part, the touchpad is a bit small, but smooth and responsive. It includes a fingerprint reader in its top right corner for secure sign-in, as well. I mentioned the display\u2019s size, but let's back up for its specs and features. The 14-inch screen bears a full HD resolution and, naturally given that it can be rotated and used as a tablet, touch capability. The bezels are pretty slim, particularly on the sides, which is key in reducing the laptop's footprint. The screen looks pretty sleek, blending into the design, and is one of the system's best features. It appears big, looks sharp, and gets plenty bright. For the centerpiece of a hybrid laptop, it does its job well. Rounding out the physical build, we come to the ports. While this is a pretty thin and compact laptop, it offers all the ports you'll likely need, so kudos to Asus on that front. The left side holds just one USB 2.0 port, while the right flank offers a USB 3.0 Type-A port, a USB Type-C port, a full-size HDMI output, and a microSD card slot. There is no Thunderbolt 3 support here, but that is forgivable at the price. The laptop also includes a 720p webcam at the center of the top bezel (it delivers decent video quality), as well as support for Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth wireless connections. Now, on to the components and performance. There are two models of this laptop, one at $599 and one at $699. Ours is the more expensive TM420IA-DB71T model, and it includes an AMD Ryzen 7 4700U processor with AMD Radeon Graphics, 8GB of memory, and a 512GB solid-state drive. The $599 version (model TM420IA-DB51T) drops the processor down to the Ryzen 5 4500U and the storage to a 256GB SSD, while all else remains the same. (See how we test laptops.) To judge the benchmark results of this machine, I've gathered a group of competitor laptops to compare against. These are all inexpensive convertibles, priced right around the cost of the VivoBook Flip 14. You can see their names and specs in the table below. PCMark 10 and 8 are holistic performance suites developed by the PC benchmark specialists at UL (formerly Futuremark). The PCMark 10 test we run simulates different real-world productivity and content creation workflows. We use it to assess overall system performance for office-centric tasks such as word processing, spreadsheet jockeying, web browsing, and videoconferencing. PCMark 8, meanwhile, has a storage subtest that we use to assess the speed of the system's boot drive. Both tests yield proprietary numeric scores; higher numbers are better. AMD's 4000-series Ryzen processors have impressed us so far, and this one is no different. While PCMark 10 is not the test that will push a processor to its limit, the VivoBook Flip 14 still came out on top here. While an inexpensive system, it's still capable (even a touch more so than the others) of multitasking and efficiently running your everyday programs. The storage is also speedy, though all of these SSDs will boot and load about equally quickly. Next is Maxon's CPU-crunching Cinebench R15 test, which is fully threaded to make use of all available processor cores and threads. Cinebench stresses the CPU rather than the GPU to render a complex image. The result is a proprietary score indicating a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Cinebench is often a good predictor of our Handbrake video editing trial, another tough, threaded workout that's highly CPU-dependent and scales well with cores and threads. In it, we put a stopwatch on test systems as they transcode a standard 12-minute clip of 4K video (the open-source Blender demo movie Tears of Steel) to a 1080p MP4 file. It's a timed test, and lower results are better. We also run a custom Adobe Photoshop image editing benchmark. Using an early 2018 release of the Creative Cloud version of Photoshop, we apply a series of 10 complex filters and effects to a standard JPEG test image. We time each operation and add up the total. As with Handbrake, lower times are better here. The Ryzen 7 chip flexes its muscles here, its eight cores and eight threads powering through these tasks relative to the others. Not all of these benchmarks show big leads over the next-best laptop, but most are pretty comfortable, and some of the competitors are way behind in some results. The sustained Handbrake test and somewhat sustained Cinebench test especially show the efficiency of the processor compared to others. That doesn't make this a specialized media workstation, granted, but you shouldn't expect as much in this price range anyway. Those who need such a laptop for work or school will need to spend more, but for this category, you can perform some editing and encoding without painful wait times. 3DMark measures relative graphics muscle by rendering sequences of highly detailed, gaming-style 3D graphics that emphasize particles and lighting. We run two different 3DMark subtests, Sky Diver and Fire Strike, which are suited to different types of systems. Both are DirectX 11 benchmarks. Sky Diver is more suited to midrange PCs, while Fire Strike is more demanding and made for high-end PCs to strut their stuff. The results are proprietary scores. Next up is another synthetic graphics test, this time from Unigine Corp. Like 3DMark, the Superposition test renders and pans through a detailed 3D scene and measures how the system copes. In this case, it's rendered in the eponymous Unigine engine, offering a different 3D workload scenario for a second opinion on each laptop's graphical prowess. Then we come to the 3D performance, which isn\u2019t great on any of these laptops. Currently, integrated graphics don't offer much power (this may change soon with Intel Iris Xe!) for gaming or any 3D task. The VivoBook Flip 14 is among the better options here, but not by much, and they're still all in the low tier. This means you can do some simple and low-settings gaming, but mainstream and hardcore fans will want to look into a gaming laptop with a discrete GPU. After fully recharging the laptop, we set up the machine in power-save mode (as opposed to balanced or high-performance mode) where available and make a few other battery-conserving tweaks in preparation for our unplugged video rundown test. (We also turn Wi-Fi off, putting the laptop in airplane mode.) In this test, we loop a video\u2014a locally stored 720p file of the same Tears of Steel short we use in our Handbrake test\u2014with screen brightness set at 50 percent and volume at 100 percent until the system quits. The Flip's battery life is good, but certainly not elite. Ten and a half hours is, on its own, a pretty good result. You'll get a full day of classes or a commute off of that amount, so it's not a weakness. If you're a true road warrior and spend a very long time off the charger, though, you may want to consider one of the more enduring alternatives. The IdeaPad Flex 5 14 is the only option that is in a different tier of battery life altogether, though, while the others represent a modest improvement. The Asus VivoBook Flip is a good budget convertible with no major weak points. The build is compact and lightweight, it has a healthy selection of ports and a nice screen, and battery life is decent. The performance, in particular, is a strong suit, thanks to the Ryzen 7 chip, which tops the Ryzen 5 and Intel alternatives in machines around the same price.\u00a0 That said, those things don\u2019t make it a great budget convertible. The build is solid enough on the exterior, but a little too flexible around the keyboard deck, and the keyboard is so-so. The battery life is merely okay, as well. These are the aspects that remind you this is an inexpensive laptop, but the same doesn't apply to all machines in this tier. Compared to the designs of the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 14 and the HP Envy x360 13 (2020), the Asus is not as impressive. It does get extra points for performance, but at the end of the day, the IdeaPad Flex 5 14 is a superior laptop overall for $100 less and retains its Editors' Choice. Still, if you're concerned with raw CPU performance above all, the VivoBook Flip 14 has plenty of charm inside its shell. The Asus VivoBook Flip 14 does a lot right for a convertible laptop, delivering top performance in its price tier, but its build and feature set fall behind some less expensive alternatives.

Much like your phone, 4G LTE home internet uses cellular signals to provide internet access. This allows people to connect to the internet anywhere they can get phone reception without needing to install a physical cable to their home. And if you get a mobile 4G LTE hotspot, you can even take it with you when you travel. Unlike a phone plan, however, 4G LTE internet plans give you a lot of the perks of a traditional internet plan. Plans are generally geared toward meeting the needs of an entire household, with higher data caps or unlimited data. 4G LTE home internet is one of the most widely available types of internet and can be a definite improvement if you\u2019ve got a slow dial-up, DSL, or satellite plan, making it a great alternative to these connections in rural areas. That said, it\u2019s still one of the slowest choices, so if you have other internet options, you can usually get a much faster speed for the same price. Certain 4G LTE plans have the added bonus of portability, allowing you to take your router with you when you travel and use the same network and internet plan you use at home on the road. The trade-off is that these plans are usually more expensive than those that are designed to work in a fixed location. They also differ from mobile hotspots and phones, as they typically require being set up in a stationary location before you can connect them to the internet. Data effective as of post date. Pricing and speeds are subject to change. Not all offers available in all areas. *Plus taxes and fees. With Auto Pay. \u2020With AutoPay via a $10/mo. bill credit \u202130-Day Service Trial Included with purchase of Gateway. In general, home 4G LTE providers like Verizon and T-Mobile can offer lower prices because your home stays at a fixed location. Mobile hotspots, like UbiFi and Ladybug, have a higher monthly cost but give you the freedom to connect to the internet anywhere you have service. Because of the wide-reaching accessibility of cellular networks, it\u2019s likely you have a 4G LTE provider in your area. Search with your zip code to see which internet providers offer service near you. Wide availability\u2014The main advantage of 4G LTE home internet is that it uses existing cell infrastructure, which already covers the vast majority of the US population. Large cell phone providers like Verizon and T-Mobile each have their own extensive 4G networks, while smaller companies like UbiFi purchase bandwidth from multiple providers, extending their availability even farther. If you can get a phone signal in your house, you can probably get 4G LTE home internet. Low monthly costs\u2014You can usually find 4G LTE home internet for a reasonable price, around the same cost per month as cable, fiber, or DSL. It also doesn\u2019t require the more expensive equipment and installation needed for a satellite connection, so there are fewer upfront costs too. Higher data caps\u2014One of the disadvantages of using the internet on your phone is that there are often very restrictive data caps on phone plans, leading to extra fees or throttled speeds. Because they are meant for use by an entire household, 4G LTE home internet plans have higher data caps so that everyone in the home can use the internet without running up against these data limits. Some portability\u2014Providers like Ladybug Wireless offer mobile hotspots rather than fixed home internet. Unlike most other types of internet connections, you can take your 4G LTE hotspot with you wherever your provider has service. Although 4G hotspots are not as portable as a cell phone, you can easily take your hotspot with you on vacation or on business trips to keep using your normal internet service, even when away from home. Low speeds\u2014The biggest downside of home 4G LTE is that it\u2019s slow. If you own a smartphone, you\u2019re probably familiar with how long it takes to download a video when you\u2019re not on Wi-Fi. Those wait times on your home computer might not be very appealing. Data rates also drop the farther you get from a cell tower, so if your house is near the edge of a cell boundary, you might get even less than expected. Variable signal strength\u2014Anyone who\u2019s used a cell phone has had experiences with losing their signal or walking through a dead zone. Most 4G LTE home internet providers have tools to help you find the best spot in your house to set up your receiver, but the quality of the connection will still vary from house to house. 4G internet works on cellular technology, just like your cell phone. 4G stands for \u201cfourth generation\u201d cell phone technology, which is the generation of technology that was introduced just after the development of smartphones like the iPhone. The fourth generation of cell phone technology was a new set of standards for how cellular providers built their networks. This introduced new kinds of broadcasting equipment and new methods of connecting that made possible many of the features that we\u2019re accustomed to using on our phones\u2014like HD video, livestreaming, and interactive apps. Perhaps the most noticeable change is that 4G technology dramatically increased the download speed on cellular networks. If your phone has ever defaulted to a 3G network while you were trying to use the internet, you probably know what a big difference this makes. Current 4G technologies are fast enough that they can actually surpass some wired technologies like DSL in some situations, which is why many ISPs have begun using their 4G networks not just for phones but for home internet as well. Cellular technology generations don\u2019t refer to a single product or device, but instead are a set of standards. These standards are set by the International Telecommunications Union-Radio communications sector (ITU-R), and they are officially known as the International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced (IMT-Advanced) specification.1 For a cellular technology to be considered 4G, it has to use certain types of technology (such as IP telephony and worldwide roaming capacity), as well as meet certain technological thresholds, such as speed requirements. For 4G, this includes data rates of 100 Mbps.1 When these new 4G technologies were first released, they allowed cellular providers to offer vastly improved speeds over 3G networks, although most still struggled to achieve the speeds necessary to be officially classified as 4G networks. Providers began referring to these networks that used 4G technologies but didn\u2019t yet meet the speed requirements as \u201c4G Long-Term Evolution\u201d or 4G LTE, with the assumption that these networks would eventually meet 4G requirements in the long term.2 A decade later, most of these networks are still 4G LTE. At this point, cellular research is shifting toward developing 5G technologies, which have the potential to reach even higher speeds (5G also has much higher speed requirements); however, 4G technologies still fill an important niche in our telecommunications ecosystem. Some home 4G providers, like Ultra, offer 5G speeds in their plans. But to take advantage of these speeds, you need 5G-capable equipment (which is more expensive) and an available 5G signal. Currently, most 5G coverage is located in densely populated urban areas. 4G, on the other hand, is already widespread, reaching the vast majority of the US population. It\u2019s not as fast or reliable as technologies like fiber, but it offers a cheap and immediate way for millions of people to connect to the internet without requiring any additional infrastructure to be built. This makes it a great alternative to satellite internet in rural areas that don\u2019t have access to wired connections. Yes, you can get unlimited 4G LTE home internet. In fact, unlimited data is one of the main reasons to get a dedicated 4G LTE home internet plan, rather than getting data through your standard mobile wireless plan and using your phone as a hotspot. It\u2019s also why 4G LTE home internet might be a better option for you than satellite internet, which comes with low data caps. If multiple people will be using your internet connection, it\u2019s helpful to have a dedicated router or hotspot and a plan with high data caps or unlimited data. It\u2019s also worth noting that while many providers advertise unlimited data with no overage charges, some still throttle or deprioritize your connection once you pass a certain data threshold. Make sure to read the fine print to make sure your connection is truly unlimited for the whole month. 4G LTE hotspots are portable, which means that you can take them outside your home and still connect using the same internet plan as long as you get reception. 4G LTE home internet is designed to be used in your home and won\u2019t function if you take your router to a different location. Fixed plans, like those offered by Verizon and T-Mobile, are usually cheaper than hotspot plans and have higher data caps or unlimited data. So if you don\u2019t need the flexibility of a mobile hotspot, getting 4G LTE home internet is a better option. For more information, check out our picks for the best mobile hotspots and the best hotspot data plans. 4G LTE stands for fourth generation (cellular technology) long-term evolution. It\u2019s a marketing term for cellular networks that don\u2019t hit true 4G speeds but still use many 4G technologies. Providers call their networks LTE to show that, although they didn\u2019t hit 4G speeds, they use fourth-generation cellular technology in hopes of eventually upgrading them to handle a true 4G network. 4G LTE speeds have improved dramatically over the past decade, but since \u201cLTE\u201d covers all networks that are still working toward meeting 4G standards, you\u2019ll still find a great deal of speed variation between carriers. It\u2019s also important to note that although 4G LTE networks don\u2019t reach true 4G speeds, all 4G devices are compatible with these networks. You don\u2019t need a special router or hotspot to connect to a 4G LTE network. Any 4G device will work. Yes, a 4G hotspot can be used for home internet and can even replace other kinds of internet service. Mobile 4G LTE hotspots are generally more expensive than plans for fixed 4G LTE home internet and have lower data caps. So if portability isn\u2019t an important factor, you should get a 4G LTE home internet plan instead. 4G LTE, whether fixed or mobile, isn\u2019t the fastest type of internet connection. If you have the option for cable, 5G, or fiber, you probably wouldn\u2019t want to replace it with a slower 4G connection. 4G and 4G LTE are definitely faster than dial-up, and in some cases might be an improvement over satellite or DSL. If you\u2019re not sure which is faster, it\u2019s a good idea to contact your local 4G provider and ask about specific speeds for your area. You can also take an internet speed test from your phone and compare it to your home network speeds. 4G home internet is good enough for doing a lot of tasks, such as checking email and surfing the web. For more bandwidth-intensive activities like streaming Netflix or online multiplayer games, 4G might not cut it. If you\u2019re not sure what your household bandwidth requirements are, check out our How Much Speed Do I Need? Tool. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defines high-speed internet (or broadband) as an internet connection with at least 25 Mbps download speeds. Some 4G LTE providers reach these speeds, but many do not. 4G internet uses a specialized router/receiver, sometimes called a hotspot, though the terminology changes a bit depending on the provider. This device connects to your provider\u2019s cellular network and then broadcasts a Wi-Fi network inside your home that your devices can connect to. There are a lot of 4G hotspots on the market, but the best one for you depends a lot on which providers have reception in your area (or areas you might travel). For that reason, it\u2019s often best to buy a hotspot through your cell phone provider. For more information, check out our round up of the best mobile hotspots on the market today. 5G is the fifth generation of cellular technology, and has the potential to be much faster than 4G and 4G LTE\u2014potentially reaching speeds of 20 Gbps.3 As it becomes more widespread, this new tech will be great for mobile phone users, but it will be especially important for home internet. 5G offers the speeds necessary for multiple devices to connect to your home network and do things like watch videos and play online games. The downside is that the higher frequencies used by 5G signals have a much shorter range, so it will require constructing many more cell towers in closer range to cover the same area as 4G. 5G technology currently makes use of several different spectrum bands, which means that there is a lot of variation between 5G providers. While low-band has the potential to significantly improve internet speeds in rural areas, it doesn\u2019t support the same features and speeds as high-band 5G.4 The great thing about 4G home internet is that 4G and 4G LTE networks are already here.

This week, Microsoft also announced that they will add support for the open media standards Ogg (media container), Vorbis (audio codec), and Theora (video codec) to a future version of Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge. The Microsoft Edge platform development status page announced on October 9th that Microsoft is now working on implementing support for these new media formats. Edge is usually the first part of Microsoft to announce such changes as Microsoft has seen the need to keep a more open dialog with web developers about upcoming changes to the platform. The news comes way too late for support for the new media formats to be included in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update due later this year. Update (2017-12-05): Microsoft have now released support for Ogg media container files and these codecs as an optional add-on to Windows 10 and Xbox One available for free in the Microsoft Store. Windows 10 already support other open media formats like the Matroska (MKV) container format, the WebM video container format, as well as the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) and recently the Opus audio codec. MKV, WebM, FLAC, and Opus support isn\u2019t just limited to Microsoft Edge \u2013 they work in all Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. This will probably be the case for Ogg, Theora, and Vorbis too \u2014 because who\u2019d want to maintain two separate multimedia implementations on one platform? I\u2019d hazard to guess that the decision to work on adding support for Vorbis at this point may have been heavily motivated by Microsoft\u2019s growing partnership with Spotify. Last week, Microsoft announced it would migrate their Groove music customers to Spotify. Spotify shipped an app for the Xbox One and appeared in the Windows Store just last month. To continue on my trail of speculation, I\u2019d also like to point that we might were well be seeing signs of a possible Microsoft acquisition of Spotify in the works right here. The two companies sure are tying tighter bounds between each other. Spotify have been using Vorbis as their default audio codec on desktop for years. As far as I can tell, Spotify\u2019s 140 million active users (as of 2017-07) makes them the world\u2019s largest distributor of Vorbis encoded audio. Until now, Spotify have included their own Vorbis audio codec decoder (libvorbis and libogg) as part of the Spotify software. I believe that Microsoft can provide better performance and reduce the power requirement with their own implementation as part of Windows compared to decoding audio outside of the native Windows multimedia stack. While this may not matter much on high-end desktop computers, laptops and Xbox consoles running on Windows 10 may benefit more form a better platform integration. The Vorbis audio codec isn\u2019t only used in Ogg media containers; but is often found in WebM media containers. Microsoft Edge and Windows 10 already has partial support for WebM video playback without audio. Getting Vorbis playback in place would mean Microsoft product would be capable of playing back even more WebM files without dropping their audio streams. Vorbis have tried to compete as an unpatented and cost-free alternative to the MP3 audio codec for 17 years without any notable success besides being the format of choice for Spotify. The last patents to the MP3 audio codec expired earlier this year. It could be that Microsoft wouldn\u2019t commit to supporting Vorbis for all those years until after the possible unexplored legal treats from MP3 format rights holders had been laid to rest. Vorbis offers better sounding audio at in much smaller file sizes compared to MP3. Yet the format hasn\u2019t had any large organizations pushing for its adoption. Users have had the ability to install support in Windows for the last 14 years, but who installs any add-on codecs these days? Going forward, Windows will support three more open media formats which is good for the open web and the free exchange of culture and media. The only remaining web browser vendor who haven\u2019t shown any sign of adopting any open media formats, besides Opus, is Apple. Will Microsoft\u2019s newfound love for open standards sway the last holdout to reconsider adopting open formats? I sure do hope so. This site is primarily supported by ads.

You\u2019ve heard them. 4G, 4G LTE, 4G LTE-A, 5Ge, 5G, 5G NR, 5G+. But what do they actually mean?  4G, short for \u201cFourth Generation,\u201d is a specification laid down by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in 2008. Specifically, this was laid down by the ITU-R, which deals with radio communications. 4G is known primarily for its broadband capabilities and significantly faster speeds than the former 3G, which introduced data connectivity into the cellular space.  Since there was such an enormous gap between the old 3G standard and 4G, companies wanted to make sure their customer base knew they were receiving better service than just the same old 3G networks, so they came up with a workaround. That workaround was LTE, short for \"Long-Term Evolution.\" The original idea was that it represented a \"Long-Term Evolution\" toward the 4G standard. What clever marketers figured out was that they could present it as something greater than that standard if they simply added \"4G\" before it. Hence, \"4G LTE.\"  The ITU standard specified a minimum specification of 100 Mbps download speed and a maximum of 1Gbps, which, at the time, was impossible. It wasn\u2019t until years later that U.S. carrier networks realized these aims. To qualify for true 4G, your wireless network has to be able to download at a minimum of 100 Mbps. Some carriers have dubbed this 4G LTE-A (Verizon), 5Ge (AT&T), or 4G LTE+ to separate it from 4G LTE.  Even though 5G has been deployed, 4G networks are still dominant in America, with most calls and text being handled over 4G. Currently, 5G networks mostly handle data, though that\u2019s projected to change in the foreseeable future.  T-Mobile has made claims that they\u2019re working on Voice over 5G or Voice over New Radio (VoNR) so their 5G network can handle voice and data. Neither Verizon Wireless nor AT&T have announced plans for a voice service over 5G. Thus, high-speed 5G phones will continue to use 4G networks for a while (2030 to 2035 is estimated, but 4G could last even longer).  As stated previously, LTE stands for \u201cLong Term Evolution\u201d and is a marketing phrase to signify progression toward true 4G. When someone says 4G LTE, they are actually talking about something weaker than true 4G, but better than simple 3G. At this point, the LTE International Standard is loosely defined and frequently updated, making a true LTE standard hard to nail down.  In short, it\u2019s an upgraded 3G, but worse than true 4G. 4G LTE networks send data to 4G LTE phones at a rate lower than 100 Mbps.  The worst part is, now that companies have attained 4G speeds, they don\u2019t want to advertise it. Most consumers believe 4G LTE to be an advanced version of 4G instead of what it really is. Hence the terms 5Ge, 4G LTE-A, 4G LTE+ (which are just 4G). These are the fastest 4G options available.  As there is no true standard for 4G LTE, it covers the entire range between 3G\u2019s average 3 Mbps to 4G\u2019s 100 Mbps, giving it a massive range of potential speeds. On average, however, download speeds range from 12-30 Mbps, with faster speeds available in major cities. 5G is the new standard laid out by the ITU. This fifth-generation network is designed to deliver faster speeds, lower latency, greater network capacity, and more reliability to connect virtually everyone and everything. It leverages new technologies and expands into new frequency spectrums to achieve this.   To be considered true 5G, the standard has a minimum requirement of 1 Gbps with 1 millisecond of latency.    There are three types of 5G, low-band 5G, mid-band 5G, and high-band 5G, all with different speeds and latency rates. Like 4G, one could say not all 5G is true 5G.    Rollout began early 2019, and it\u2019s likely to take decades for full implementation.   For a deep dive on 5G, visit our ultimate 5G guide.  5G will revolutionize download speeds and completely change the way devices stay connected. In its most perfect form, 5G is supposed to offer a maximum of 20 Gbps and a minimum of 1 Gbps. However, with so many different flavors of 5G, speeds vary a lot.  Low-band 5G speeds are slightly faster than 4G. As you move up the spectrum, speeds get significantly faster, but the range of the signal decreases. All in all, you\u2019ll get close to true 5G speeds when connected to the higher end of the 5G mid-band or the mmWave.   Even though speeds are much faster than 4G, as we've mentioned before, 5G will not replace 4G. There are too many benefits to 4G that we won't get into here, but if you'd like to know more about how the 4G and 5G waveform differ, we recommend this article.  Latency is the amount of time it takes for a signal to travel to and from a network server. Lower latency means faster response time, and vice versa. 5G offers an extremely low latency rate. The specification for true 5G calls for about 1 millisecond, while 4G\u2019s ideal rate is 10ms. Huge difference.  Realistically, you probably won\u2019t get close to 1ms latency rates unless you\u2019re connected to C-Band or the mmWave. In these early stages of 5G, real-world results show between 5ms to 10ms. The average for 4G is between 30ms to 70ms.   As mentioned above, there are different types of 5G that operate at different frequencies and provide different speeds. Because each carrier has different names for each level and markets them as such, there are a variety of different 5G icons. Cue the same confusion that 4G and 4G LTE caused. When connected to low-band frequencies, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile devices display the standard 5G icon. The icon changes to 5G+ for AT&T, 5G UW (Ultra-Wideband) for Verizon, or 5G UC (Ultra-Capacity) for T-Mobile when connected to the mid-band or high-band spectrum. These will be the 5G networks closest to true 5G.   If you\u2019ve been researching 5G, the term 5G NR or 5G New Radio has probably popped up a couple of times. It\u2019s the new radio access technology set by 3GPP for the 5G standard. The previous radio access technology specification being LTE.  5G NR defines how 5G devices (smartphones, routers, gateways, etc.) and 5G network infrastructure (cell towers, small cells, and other Radio Access Network equipment) use radio waves to talk to each other. It\u2019s developed in such an intricate way to create a flexible, scalable, and efficient 5G network to support a wide variety of use cases and demands.    Compared to LTE, 5G NR provides faster data transmission, less latency, and other significant enhancements to the network.  To learn more about 5G NR, click here for a great and relatively easy-to-digest article by Sierra Wireless. 5G networks use entirely different frequencies. In order for a phone to work with 5G networks, it must be able to read those frequencies. Thus, 4G phones do not support 5G, but will continue to work in this ever-evolving 5G world.    Does this mean you need to upgrade to a 5G device? Unless you live in an area where 5G is available and sit around outside watching movies or browsing the web a great deal, there isn\u2019t much need to do so just yet. Though, if you\u2019re keen to upgrade, you\u2019re likely to receive speed improvements.  There have been various fear mongers out there questioning the safety of 5G technology. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), few studies have been performed. However, since radiofrequency exposure remains below international guidelines, no public health risks are anticipated.  Think about it. Low-band 5G uses similar frequencies as 4G. We know that the only concrete data relating to those frequencies is an increase in body temperature. There is no definitive proof of other potential health risks. As frequencies increase, which 5G\u2019s clearly do, there is less penetration into the body.  Look at where in the spectrum 5g mid-band frequencies are located \u2013 near the 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi bands. They are not going to harm us any more than WiFi. Plus, many studies state that there is no evidence of health effects from WiFi radiofrequency exposure.    The mmWave is the most feared - a bit ironic. These frequency waves can only travel short distances and are easily interrupted. Many experts say that the mmWave does not penetrate beyond the outer layer of skin, if that. Its only proven effect is that it makes things slightly warmer.  As more research is published, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you posted.    The difference between 5G and 4G goes beyond waveforms, speed, and latency. 5G infrastructure will be much larger than 4G. As you probably already know, 4G predominantly uses large cell towers to transmit signals. That\u2019s not going away. 5G will also use cell towers to transmit long range frequencies. For higher frequencies that only travel short distances, however, small cells will be densely deployed throughout urban and some suburban areas.  The technology implemented into 5G networks makes it so that cell sites can support approximately 1 million devices per square kilometer, whereas 4G supports about 4,000 devices within the same area. Cell sites can also focus 5G signal directly into a device rather than broadcasting in every direction, creating a more efficient network.    This significant increase in capacity allows greater connectivity to more than just phones. Revolutionizing the way we receive data, and, more broadly, the way machines, devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT) communicate.    With faster speeds, extremely low latency, higher capacity, and new tech, 5G can make vitalization, full self-driving cars, same-day delivery drones, and more a reality. Even though it will take years to get there, this is something that isn't possible with 4G.    Where 5G might not be noticeable yet is in your basic calls and texts. In the meantime, carriers plan to make use of their existing 4G network and slowly integrate 5G. As of 2022, 5G only provides data and does not affect voice.  Since 5G standards are always being worked toward, the differences between 5G and 4G will only increase. If all you do with your mobile devices is send texts and make calls, you won\u2019t see much difference. Where the difference is most felt is in areas where 5G is available when running data-intensive applications.  At this point, the gap is slim, especially with 4G LTE-A being more or less \u201ctrue\u201d 4G.  Under optimal signal conditions, you should see minimum speeds of 100 Mbps - this ensures you\u2019re getting true 4G. Maximum 4G speeds cap out at 1000 Mbps down, and 500 Mbps up, so if you get anything approaching these speeds, you are on the true cutting edge of 4G, even though the specs were laid down over a decade ago.  Of course, all this assumes you have optimized 4G or LTE signal. Many areas suffer from weak 4G signal, and if you\u2019re interested in learning how to rid yourself of this, keep reading.

I have question where can i find global phone book in windows 10. When you create VPN connection with powershell or windows settings it will be saved into: %AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Network\\Connections\\Pbk\\rasphone.pbk Problem is when i use parameter -AllUserConnection for creating VPN so other users can use the connection from login screen too it will be saved into global phonebook due to msdocs. It's not same phonebook in location above, cause i can see VPN connection in my network adapters but its not store in the phonebook and without that parameter it will stored in that phonebook. Any ideas where this global phonebook is stored? Need it for my automatization script. Found an answer. Global phonebook is in here: Adding this here as related and may help any other people with similar issue. Basically I had an issue where I was creating a VPN connection using a Powershell script and executing that script using Meraki System's Manager.  I managed to somehow cause the 'Get-VPNConnection' cmd to just hang!

Machine Learning has numerous applications of course, and the idea of text prediction piqued my interest. Those who know me may be aware that not only do I lead the pgAdmin project (part of which involves developing and running the website), but I'm also part of the PostgreSQL web and sysadmin teams who look after the PostgreSQL website. As I was researching natural language processing, I started thinking that maybe machine learning techniques could be used to generate suggestions for search criteria based on the contents of our product documentation, the idea being that by offering intelligent auto-completion based on the actual site content as the user types, we could offer a far better user experience. An example of this would be the way that when you start typing into the Google search box;\u00a0it offers you suggestions to complete your search query.\n\u00a0 Preparing the data is perhaps the most important (and possibly complex) step when training a model to perform test prediction or other natural language processing functions. There are a couple of phases to this: First, we need to extract the data and clean it up in order to create the corpus (a structured textual dataset) that the network will be trained with. In my experimental script this involved a number of steps: At the end of this process we're left with a list of sentences, all in lowercase, consisting of at least two words and no punctuation. Now that we have a corpus of text to work with, we need to get it into a format that we can process with a Tensorflow model. There are a number of steps to this process as well: Once we've done this, we have the data we need to train a model; a set of numeric input values that represent the input strings, and a corresponding set of numeric result values that represent the expected final word for each sentence.\n\u00a0 In my previous experiment with time series prediction, I used a model that implemented the WaveNet architecture; multiple one dimensional convolutional layers with increasing dilation that allowed it to detect and learn seasonality in the data. In this case, I'm using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) consisting of multiple bi-directional layers of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units. The idea of an RNN is that it can handle \"long term dependencies\" by using the past information to help provide context to the present. This works well with relatively small gaps between the past and present, but not so well when the gaps become longer. This is where LSTM units help, as they are able to remember (and forget) data from much earlier in the sequence, enabling the network to better connect the past data with the present. Christopher Olah has an excellent blog post describing RNNs and LSTMs that can provide more in-depth information. In this case, I'm creating a model that consists of a the following layers: The embedding layer converts the input data to fixed size dense vectors that match the size of the following layer. The LSTM layers are responsible for the actual work. The dropout layer will randomly set some input units to zero during training. This helps prevent overfitting where the model learns the actual training data rather than the characteristics of the data. The dense layer provides us with a final vector of probabilities for the next word based on the word index. The model looks like this: \u00a0 I split the code for this experiment into two parts; html-train.py which is responsible for creating the model, training it, and saving both the model and the tokenizer data that contains the word index etc, and test-model.py which will load a previously saved model and tokenizer data and allow it to be tested by hand. The code can be found on Github. I immediately ran into problems when training the model; despite EDB providing me with a very high spec MacBook Pro, it was going to take an extremely long time to run the training. This is largely because Tensorflow is not GPU optimised on macOS. Instead I spun up a GPU optimised Linux instance on Amazon AWS, which proved able to run the training at something like ten times the speed of my laptop. I was able to use the smallest machine type available (g4dn.xlarge); the code doesn't require huge amounts of RAM or CPU, and using multiple GPUs would require the code to be changed to support parallelism which would significantly complicate it, more so than seems worthwhile for this experiment. Once I had run the training using a copy of the pgAdmin documentation in HTML format, I was left with a Tensorflow model file and the JSON file representing the tokenizer, both of which I copied to my laptop for testing.\n\u00a0 As you'll recall, the aim of the experiment was to see if it is viable to offer users of the pgAdmin or PostgreSQL websites auto-complete options for their searches in the documentation. The test program loads the model and tokenizer and then prompts the user for an input word (or words), and offers a user-specified number of follow-on words. If the user requests more than one word, it doesn't predict them all at once, instead, it predicts one word, adds it to the word(s) provided by the user, and then predicts the next word and so on, thus predicting each word based on the entirety of the sentence as it's constructed. Here's an example of a test session: python3 test-model.py -d pgadmin-docs.json -m pgadmin-docs.h5 Enter text (blank to quit): trigger Number of words to generate (default: 1):\u00a0 Results: trigger date Enter text (blank to quit): table Number of words to generate (default: 1):\u00a0 Results: table you Enter text (blank to quit): trigger function Number of words to generate (default: 1):\u00a0 Results: trigger function is Enter text (blank to quit): trigger function Number of words to generate (default: 1): 5 Results: trigger function is not the default of Enter text (blank to quit): creating a table Number of words to generate (default: 1): 10 Results: creating a table is no restrictions to the server and confirm deletion of Enter text (blank to quit):  It's clear that those results are quite disappointing\u2014and similar results were seen with various other tests with the pgAdmin documentation and also with the PostgreSQL documentation: python3 test-model.py -d postgresql-docs.json -m postgresql-docs.h5 Enter text (blank to quit): trigger Number of words to generate (default: 1):\u00a0 Results: trigger exclusion Enter text (blank to quit): constraint Number of words to generate (default: 1):\u00a0 Results: constraint name Enter text (blank to quit): create table Number of words to generate (default: 1): 5 Results: create table is also not to the Enter text (blank to quit): max aggregate Number of words to generate (default: 1): 5 Results: max aggregate page size of the data Enter text (blank to quit):  It's safe to say that offering auto-complete suggestions such as those generated would almost certainly not improve the user experience for most users.\n\u00a0 The results of this experiment were quite disappointing\u2014though I have to say that wasn't entirely unexpected. Searching can be something of an art form. Whilst many search engines try to make the experience as natural as possible, users will almost certainly get the best results by using specific search terms and operators supported by each engine, rather than natural phrasing. Even so, it's clear in this experiment that the model really wasn't generating naturally phrased strings, which isn't overly surprising considering how complex and nuanced the English language is and the fact that this is relatively simple code that was put together over and experimented with over a couple of weeks. It's certainly possible that better results could be achieved by fine tuning the model or by improving the quality of the data preparation (and maybe including the content of the <title> tags for example), however, is it worth it? As a software developer given the task of providing auto-completion suggestions for search users I would almost certainly approach the problem in a different way; log the queries that users execute, and when a user is typing in their criteria, perform a string prefix search of the logged queries using the text they've typed so far, thus offering suggestions based on what real people have searched with in the past. In a framework such as Django, the backend code to do that could be written in minutes. Another option might be to employ Markov chains to predict the text based on the training corpus. A nice example of that is shown in Ashwin M J's blog. It was a fun experiment, but using non-machine learning techniques for this particular task would be far easier to implement and would almost certainly yield much better results for individual websites. \nThoughts?

sometimes your phone has the 4G symbol next to the service bars. Other times, it says LTE.\u00a0In this article, I'll explain the difference between 4G and LTE! You need a data connection to use the internet on a mobile phone without Wi-Fi.\u00a04G is the technology that allows that to happen. Following 3G, 4G is the fourth-generation of mobile data technology. 4G is up to 10 times faster than 3G. The speeds of mobile networks are monitored by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The ITU requires that mobile use on 4G networks must be able to reach a speed of 100 megabits per second and 1 gigabit per second from an immobile location. When 4G was first introduced, these speeds were record-breaking. Therefore, 4G was a huge step forward for technology over 3G. However, you may have noticed a slight or significant difference in your connection speeds when your phone is connected to 4G instead of LTE. The acronym \u201cLTE\u201d stands for \u201cLong Term Evolution.\u201d LTE is a 4G wireless broadband standard. It's the second most advanced option available for mobile data connectivity, only to 5G. Therefore, if you have a phone and a plan with 4G LTE capabilities, you'll be receiving some of the fastest data speeds that are widely available (high-band 5G is only available in a handful of cities). LTE technology offers faster data connection and lower latency. Additionally, LTE lets more\u00a0phones connect to the same network at one time. This means that areas with higher traffic such as a concert or sporting event won't be affected as much as they would with older cellular technology. However, not all devices support LTE. Below, I'll explain the main differences between 4G and LTE. 4G and LTE are often used interchangeably, but there are a couple differences between the two. As mentioned before, the ITU created standards for the speeds that 4G was required to offer. However, when 4G arrived at the market, many found that these speeds didn't meet the requirements. Therefore, 4G LTE is simply an improvement upon 4G. It's not a new generation of technology, but it had enough differences to require a name change. The main difference between the two are the upload and download speeds. Most customers might not notice the difference unless they live in a major city or heavily-populated area. LTE makes a huge difference in these areas. Nowadays, all major carriers have 4G LTE networks. The three major carriers are Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile. They may differ in their download and upload speeds, but they're still considered LTE. All of these carriers also have 4G networks. If you're someone that uses a lot of data and wants fast mobile streaming, then 4G LTE is probably your best option. However, you may currently have a device that doesn't support 4G LTE and in that case, you might consider switching.\u00a0For example, anything newer than an iPhone 5c and a Samsung Galaxy S4 can support 4G LTE technology. It's always a good idea to check if your phone can support 4G LTE before signing up for a new cell phone plan! Check out our coverage maps to see which wireless carrier has the best 4G coverage in your area! I hope this article helped you understand how 4G and LTE are different.\u00a0Both offer very high speeds, but LTE is the go-to network technology for faster\u00a0speeds. If you have any more questions about 4G or LTE, leave them in the comments section below! compare LTE latency with 4G My Samsung Note 10 Lite does not say that it is 4G it just says LTE on the status when wi-fi is shut off. I am in Canada and going to the US next month. Will this phone work there? LTE is an abbreviation. NOT an acronym, which can be pronounced as a word! How do I get 4g on my iPhone I was notified my T-Mobile ZTE Zinger Z667T won\u2019t work past 3G shutdown.\nThe phone boots up with \u201cT-Mobile 4G\u201d. My phone shows 4 bars at 4G.\nPhone specs say this is a HSPA+ (3G) phone. My phone has been lying to me. We used to say, \u201cA hundred times zero is still zero.\u201d My 3G flip worked perfectly every time I used it. Then I was told I had to change it to accommodate Tracfone\u2019s new income stream. So after a lot of back-and-forth, I bought a 4G LTE flip phone. Two or three times a day, all of a sudden my \u201cx\u201d and no bar flip phone sings like a canary. Old texts that never went, are suddenly collected. I have a string of new texts lined up to be read. I was excited today when I was trying to see\u2026\u00a0Read more \u00bb helo,\nmy phone is able for 3G/LTE. My provider tells me, that soon his network will all be changed from 3G to 4G.\nIs my \u2018LTE\u2019-phone able to get 4G ?\nThanks. so my phone says it is 2g,3g,lte.. it doesnt state 4g.. so this means it is not 4g?? i have a samsung galaxy a10s.. and one site says this has 2g,3g,4g capabilities. but under mobile networks on my phone,. it only shows 2g,3g LTE Planned obsolescence. It\u2019s the way corporations force us to replace perfectly good hardware devices, like phones and computers, cars with online capabilities. perhaps a small factor, but many changes in hardware or software are about improvements over older and slower versions. Were people forced to buy LCD TVs? No, you could keep your old vacuum tube TV screen for years and years. But if you want better resolution, want to stream Netflix and a host of other things, the old technology just doesn\u2019t cut it and that has nothing to do with planned obsolescence. Dennis, it is planed obsolescence. The makers of our phones want you to have to buy a new phone with the \u201cG\u201d (generation) advances. Back when there were only black and white TV\u2019s and color came out, the FCC said you can bring out color but the older b&W sets still had to work. Technology did that and color TV went on sell and the old sets still worked. Everybody didn\u2019t have to buy a new set. That same requirement could still be required for cello phones. The FCC just has to put the people first and not big business. Will 4g go away? Will we still have 4G LTE? Hi Paul, should be around for the foreseeable future. However, 3G will be phased out of North America in early 2022. yea..my perfectly good 3g flip is gonna be no good by the end of the year\u2026the idiots in gov\u2019t decide that it\u2019s no godd anymore\u2026really makes me so mad If a phone is advertised to support 4G LTE / 5G and does not include 4G in the description, will it still receive 4G? Consumer Cellular is trying to tell me I won\u2019t be able to make or receive calls in 30 days because my phone does not have 5G but it does have LTE.\nIs what they are telling me true? They\u2019re lying to ya. Google it. They want you to buy a phone you don\u2019t need yet.. I just spent an hour and a half with Consumer Cellular trying to make LTE work. You need at least 4G\n\ufeff Hi. I have a new 4G Android. Connection is inconsistent. It has a T-Mobile SIM card. The settings say Preferred Network Type is: LTE on (Automatic LTE/3G/2G; LTE/3G; 2G Only. Can this phone really operate as a 4G phone? Thank you very much. Nope! LTE-A is more like 4G in terms of speed and latency Thanks! I have LTE in the countryside of Germany and it\u2019s actually equal to 3G in France. I never had real 4G in Germany, even when it\u2019s written as 4G, the speed is not there. I was a Sprint customer for more than 3 years when T-Mobile notified me that my Samsung J-3 will be obsolete on Jan.1, 2022 and that I will need an upgrade.\nI am a disabled veteran and 68 years old. I\u2019m in need of someone\u2019s advice to choose an everyday reliable phone. Are you able to help? Thank you,\nJoseph Reyes\nUS Army Veteran Hi Joseph! There are a lot of great options out there for you! Here\u2019s a link to an article we published with lots of information about the best cell phones and plans for senior citizens: https://www.upphone.com/learn/deals/buyers-guides-ld/best-cell-phones-plans-seniors-ultimate-guide/ Thank you for reading and I hope this helps! Hi Joe! I think if you don\u2019t upgrade you won\u2019t have any service. You would have to call AT&T or Sprint and see. I had to upgrade and it sucks. Good day.  \n "], "https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi": [" \n\t\t\t\tPages pour les contributeurs d\u00e9connect\u00e9s en savoir plus\n \n Pour les articles homonymes, voir Wi-Fi (homonymie).\n Le (ou la) Wi-Fi, aussi orthographi\u00e9 wifi[1], est un ensemble de protocoles de communication sans fil r\u00e9gis par les normes du groupe IEEE 802.11 (ISO/CEI 8802-11). Un r\u00e9seau Wi-Fi permet de relier par ondes radio plusieurs appareils informatiques (ordinateur, routeur, smartphone, modem Internet,\u00a0etc.) au sein d'un r\u00e9seau informatique afin de permettre la transmission de donn\u00e9es entre eux.\n Apparues pour la premi\u00e8re fois en 1997, les normes IEEE 802.11 (ISO/CEI 8802-11), qui sont utilis\u00e9es internationalement, d\u00e9crivent les caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019un r\u00e9seau local sans fil (WLAN). La marque d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00ab\u00a0Wi-Fi\u00a0\u00bb correspond initialement au nom donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la certification d\u00e9livr\u00e9e par la Wi-Fi Alliance (\u00ab\u00a0Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance\u00a0\u00bb, WECA), organisme ayant pour mission de sp\u00e9cifier l\u2019interop\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 entre les mat\u00e9riels conformes \u00e0 la norme 802.11 et de vendre le label \u00ab\u00a0Wi-Fi\u00a0\u00bb aux mat\u00e9riels r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 ses sp\u00e9cifications. Pour des raisons de facilit\u00e9 d\u2019usage (et de marketing) le nom de la norme se confond aujourd\u2019hui avec le nom de la certification (c\u2019est le cas en France, en Espagne, au Canada, en Suisse, en Tunisie\u2026). Ainsi, un r\u00e9seau Wi-Fi est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 un r\u00e9seau r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 une des normes IEEE 802.11. Dans d\u2019autres pays (Allemagne et \u00c9tats-Unis par exemple) de tels r\u00e9seaux sont aussi nomm\u00e9s par le terme g\u00e9n\u00e9rique WLAN\u00a0: Wireless LAN (r\u00e9seau local sans fil).\n Gr\u00e2ce aux normes Wi-Fi, il est possible de cr\u00e9er des r\u00e9seaux locaux sans fil \u00e0 haut d\u00e9bit. En pratique, le Wi-Fi permet de relier des smartphones, ordinateurs portables, des objets connect\u00e9s ou autres p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques \u00e0 une liaison haut d\u00e9bit. Les d\u00e9bits se sont accrus avec les nouvelles normes Wi-Fi. Voici les d\u00e9bits maximums th\u00e9oriques (et r\u00e9els) pour les principales normes\u00a0: 11\u00a0Mbit/s (6\u00a0Mbit/s) en 802.11b (1999), 54\u00a0Mbit/s (25\u00a0Mbit/s) en 802.11a (1999) et 802.11g (2003), 600\u00a0Mbit/s en 802.11n (2009)[2],[3], 1,3\u00a0Gbit/s[4] en 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5, 2013) et 10,5\u00a0Gbit/s en 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6, 2021).\n Le Wi-Fi est un ensemble de normes concernant les r\u00e9seaux sans fil qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises au point par le groupe de travail 11 du comit\u00e9 de normalisation LAN/MAN de l'IEEE (IEEE 802). Sa premi\u00e8re norme est publi\u00e9e en 1997, et permet des \u00e9changes \u00e0 une vitesse th\u00e9orique de 2\u00a0Mbit/s. Le protocole se d\u00e9veloppe en 1999, avec la publication des amendements IEEE 802.11a et 802.11b, permettant respectivement des transferts de 54\u00a0Mbit/s et 11\u00a0Mbit/s th\u00e9oriques.\n Le terme \u00ab\u00a0Wi-Fi\u00a0\u00bb sugg\u00e8re la contraction de \u00ab\u00a0Wireless Fidelity\u00a0\u00bb, par analogie au terme \u00ab\u00a0Hi-Fi\u00a0\u00bb pour \u00ab\u00a0High Fidelity\u00a0\u00bb (apparu dans les ann\u00e9es 1930[5]). Cependant, bien que la Wi-Fi Alliance ait elle-m\u00eame employ\u00e9 fr\u00e9quemment ce terme dans divers articles de presse internet (notamment dans le slogan \u00ab\u00a0The Standard for Wireless Fidelity\u00a0\u00bb), selon Phil Belanger, membre fondateur de la Wi-Fi Alliance, le terme \u00ab\u00a0Wi-Fi\u00a0\u00bb n'a jamais eu de r\u00e9elle signification[6]. Il s'agit bien n\u00e9anmoins d'un jeu de mots avec \u00ab\u00a0Hi-Fi\u00a0\u00bb.\n Le terme \u00ab\u00a0Wi-Fi\u00a0\u00bb est issu de la Wi-Fi Alliance, une association cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1999[7]\u00a0; il a \u00e9t\u00e9 invent\u00e9 par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Interbrand, sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans la communication de marque, afin de proposer un terme plus attractif que la d\u00e9nomination technique \u00ab\u00a0IEEE 802.11b Direct Sequence\u00a0\u00bb. Interbrand est \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'origine du logo rappelant le symbole du Y\u012bn et du Yang. La marque Wi-Fi a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en France \u00e0 l'Institut national de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 industrielle (INPI) en juin 2000[8].\n Le Grand Dictionnaire terminologique note que \u00ab\u00a0l'usage a h\u00e9sit\u00e9 un temps entre le masculin et le f\u00e9minin, mais a finalement pench\u00e9 vers le masculin\u00a0\u00bb[9].\n Le Larousse, le Multidictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise et Usito consid\u00e8rent le mot comme uniquement masculin[10],[11],[12] tandis que Le Grand Robert le consid\u00e8re masculin ou f\u00e9minin[1].\nQuant \u00e0 l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise et la DGLFLF, ils recommandent en 2005 l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019acronyme \u00ab\u00a0ASFI\u00a0\u00bb pour \u00ab\u00a0acc\u00e8s sans fil \u00e0 l\u2019internet\u00a0\u00bb[13].\n Les normes 802.11 s\u2019attachent \u00e0 d\u00e9finir les couches basses du mod\u00e8le OSI pour une liaison sans fil utilisant des ondes \u00e9lectromagn\u00e9tiques, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire\u00a0:\n La couche physique d\u00e9finit la modulation des ondes radio\u00e9lectriques et les caract\u00e9ristiques de la signalisation pour la transmission de donn\u00e9es, tandis que la couche liaison de donn\u00e9es d\u00e9finit l\u2019interface entre le bus de la machine et la couche physique, notamment une m\u00e9thode d\u2019acc\u00e8s proche de celle utilis\u00e9e dans le standard Ethernet et les r\u00e8gles de communication entre les diff\u00e9rentes stations. Les normes 802.11 proposent donc en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 trois couches (une couche physique appel\u00e9e PHY et deux sous-couches relatives \u00e0 la couche liaison de donn\u00e9es du mod\u00e8le OSI), d\u00e9finissant des modes de transmission alternatifs que l'on peut repr\u00e9senter de la mani\u00e8re suivante\u00a0:\n Il est possible d\u2019utiliser n\u2019importe quel protocole de transport bas\u00e9 sur IP sur un r\u00e9seau 802.11 au m\u00eame titre que sur un r\u00e9seau Ethernet.\n Il existe diff\u00e9rents modes de mise en r\u00e9seau\u00a0:\n Mode qui permet de connecter les ordinateurs \u00e9quip\u00e9s d\u2019une carte Wi-Fi entre eux via un ou plusieurs points d\u2019acc\u00e8s (PA) qui agissent comme des concentrateurs (exemple\u00a0: r\u00e9p\u00e9teur ou commutateur en r\u00e9seau Ethernet). Autrefois ce mode \u00e9tait essentiellement utilis\u00e9 en entreprise. Dans ce cas, la mise en place d\u2019un tel r\u00e9seau oblige de poser \u00e0 intervalles r\u00e9guliers des bornes \u00ab\u00a0Point d\u2019acc\u00e8s\u00a0\u00bb (PA) dans la zone qui doit \u00eatre couverte par le r\u00e9seau. Les bornes, ainsi que les machines, doivent \u00eatre configur\u00e9es avec le m\u00eame nom de r\u00e9seau (SSID = Service Set IDentifier) afin de pouvoir communiquer. L\u2019avantage de ce mode, en entreprise, est de garantir un passage oblig\u00e9 par le Point d\u2019acc\u00e8s: il est donc possible de v\u00e9rifier qui acc\u00e8de au r\u00e9seau. Actuellement les FAI, les boutiques sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es et les grandes surfaces fournissent aux particuliers des routeurs sans fil qui fonctionnent en mode \u00ab\u00a0Infrastructure\u00a0\u00bb, tout en \u00e9tant tr\u00e8s faciles \u00e0 configurer.\n Mode qui permet de connecter directement les ordinateurs \u00e9quip\u00e9s d\u2019une carte Wi-Fi, sans utiliser un mat\u00e9riel tiers tel qu\u2019un point d\u2019acc\u00e8s (en anglais\u00a0: Access Point, ou AP). Ce mode est id\u00e9al pour interconnecter rapidement des machines entre elles sans mat\u00e9riel suppl\u00e9mentaire (exemple\u00a0: \u00e9change de fichiers entre portables dans un train, dans la rue, au caf\u00e9\u2026). La mise en place d\u2019un tel r\u00e9seau consiste \u00e0 configurer les machines en mode \u00ab\u00a0Ad hoc\u00a0\u00bb (au lieu du mode \u00ab\u00a0Infrastructure\u00a0\u00bb), la s\u00e9lection d\u2019un canal (fr\u00e9quence), d\u2019un nom de r\u00e9seau (SSID) communs \u00e0 tous et si n\u00e9cessaire d'une cl\u00e9 de chiffrement. L\u2019avantage de ce mode est de s\u2019affranchir de mat\u00e9riels tiers, c'est-\u00e0-dire de pouvoir fonctionner en l'absence de point d'acc\u00e8s. Des protocoles de routage dynamique (exemples\u00a0: OLSR, AODV\u2026) rendent envisageable l'utilisation de r\u00e9seaux maill\u00e9s autonomes dans lesquels la port\u00e9e ne se limite pas \u00e0 ses voisins (tous les participants jouent le r\u00f4le du routeur).\n Un point d'acc\u00e8s en mode \u00ab\u00a0Pont\u00a0\u00bb sert \u00e0 connecter un ou plusieurs points d'acc\u00e8s entre eux pour \u00e9tendre un r\u00e9seau filaire, par exemple entre deux b\u00e2timents. La connexion se fait au niveau de la couche 2 OSI. Un point d'acc\u00e8s doit fonctionner en mode \u00ab\u00a0Racine\u00a0\u00bb (\u00ab\u00a0Root Bridge\u00a0\u00bb, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement celui qui distribue l'acc\u00e8s Internet) et les autres s'y connectent en mode \u00ab\u00a0Bridge\u00a0\u00bb pour ensuite retransmettre la connexion sur leur interface Ethernet. Chacun de ces points d'acc\u00e8s peut \u00e9ventuellement \u00eatre configur\u00e9 en mode \u00ab\u00a0Pont\u00a0\u00bb avec connexion de clients. Ce mode permet de faire un pont tout en accueillant des clients comme le mode \u00ab\u00a0Infrastructure\u00a0\u00bb.\n Un point d'acc\u00e8s en mode \u00ab\u00a0R\u00e9p\u00e9teur\u00a0\u00bb permet de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter un signal Wi-Fi plus loin (par exemple pour atteindre un fond de couloir en \u00ab\u00a0L\u00a0\u00bb). Contrairement au mode \u00ab\u00a0Pont\u00a0\u00bb, l'interface Ethernet reste inactive. Chaque \u00ab\u00a0saut\u00a0\u00bb suppl\u00e9mentaire augmente cependant le temps de latence de la connexion. Un r\u00e9p\u00e9teur a \u00e9galement une tendance \u00e0 diminuer le d\u00e9bit de la connexion. En effet, son antenne doit recevoir un signal et le retransmettre par la m\u00eame interface ce qui en th\u00e9orie divise le d\u00e9bit par deux.\n Le standard IEEE 802.11 est initialement publi\u00e9 en 1997, et offre des d\u00e9bits de 1 ou 2\u00a0Mbit/s (Wi-Fi est un nom commercial, et c\u2019est par abus de langage que l\u2019on parle de \u00ab\u00a0normes\u00a0\u00bb Wi-Fi). Des r\u00e9visions ont ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 ce standard afin d\u2019augmenter le d\u00e9bit, par le biais d'amendements (c\u2019est le cas des amendements 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n et 802.11ac) ou de sp\u00e9cifier des fonctions de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou d\u2019interop\u00e9rabilit\u00e9. R\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, les changements cumul\u00e9s apport\u00e9s par les amendements 802.11 sont regroup\u00e9s en nouvelles versions du standard 802.11, qui sont identifi\u00e9es par leur ann\u00e9e de parution[14]. Le tableau suivant pr\u00e9sente les diff\u00e9rentes versions du standard 802.11, ainsi que les principaux standards et amendements qu'ils incorporent:\n \nLe tableau suivant pr\u00e9sente les principaux amendement du standard 802.11 et leur signification\u00a0:\n Elle propose le protocole Inter-Access point roaming protocol permettant \u00e0 un utilisateur itin\u00e9rant de changer de point d\u2019acc\u00e8s de fa\u00e7on transparente lors d\u2019un d\u00e9placement, quelles que soient les marques des points d\u2019acc\u00e8s pr\u00e9sents dans l\u2019infrastructure r\u00e9seau. Cette possibilit\u00e9 est appel\u00e9e itin\u00e9rance ((en) roaming).\n Am\u00e9lioration du d\u00e9bit\n Le codage OFDM \u00e9tant interne \u00e0 chacun des treize canaux de 22\u00a0MHz possibles (quatorze au Japon), il est donc possible d'utiliser au maximum, \u00e0 plein d\u00e9bit, trois de ces canaux non superpos\u00e9s (1 - 6 - 11, 2 - 7 - 12,\u00a0etc.)\n WWiSE (World-Wide Spectrum Efficiency) ou TGn Sync\n Le 802.11n a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour pouvoir utiliser les bandes de fr\u00e9quences de 2,4\u00a0GHz et/ou 5\u00a0GHz. Les premiers adaptateurs 802.11n disponibles \u00e9taient souvent simple-bande \u00e0 2,4\u00a0GHz, mais des adaptateurs double-bande (2,4\u00a0GHz ou 5\u00a0GHz, au choix) ou double-radio (2,4\u00a0GHz et 5\u00a0GHz simultan\u00e9ment) sont \u00e9galement disponibles. Le 802.11n sait combiner jusqu\u2019\u00e0 deux canaux de 20\u00a0MHz non superpos\u00e9s, ce qui permet, en th\u00e9orie d'atteindre une capacit\u00e9 totale th\u00e9orique de 600\u00a0Mbit/s dans la bande des 5\u00a0GHz.\n Am\u00e9lioration du d\u00e9bit\n Am\u00e9lioration du d\u00e9bit\n Am\u00e9lioration du d\u00e9bit et de la port\u00e9e\n Publication de l'amendement pr\u00e9vue en 2020.\n Linksys, la division grand public de Cisco Systems, avait d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 en 2006 la technologie SRX pour \u00ab\u00a0Speed and Range Expansion\u00a0\u00bb (\u00ab\u00a0Vitesse et Port\u00e9e \u00c9tendue\u00a0\u00bb). Celle-ci agr\u00e9geait le signal de deux canaux 802.11g pour doubler le taux de transfert des donn\u00e9es. Le taux maximum de transfert des donn\u00e9es via un r\u00e9seau sans fil SRX400 d\u00e9passait alors les capacit\u00e9s des r\u00e9seaux filaires Ethernet 10/100 que l\u2019on utilisait en 2006 dans la plupart des r\u00e9seaux.\n En int\u00e9rieur, la port\u00e9e peut atteindre plusieurs dizaines de m\u00e8tres (g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement entre une vingtaine et une cinquantaine de m\u00e8tres) s'il n'y a aucun obstacle g\u00eanant (mur en b\u00e9ton par exemple) entre l\u2019\u00e9metteur et l\u2019utilisateur. Ainsi, des fournisseurs d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet peuvent \u00e9tablir un r\u00e9seau Wi-Fi connect\u00e9 \u00e0 Internet dans une zone \u00e0 forte concentration d\u2019utilisateurs (gare, a\u00e9roport, h\u00f4tel, train,\u00a0etc.). Ces zones ou points d\u2019acc\u00e8s sont appel\u00e9s bornes ou points d\u2019acc\u00e8s Wi-Fi ou \u00ab\u00a0hot spots\u00a0\u00bb.\n En ext\u00e9rieur, l'actuel record est d\u00e9tenu par Ermanno Pietrosemoli, pr\u00e9sident de la Fondation de l\u2019\u00e9cole Latino-am\u00e9ricaine de Redes, avec une distance de 382\u00a0km[24].\n Les iBooks d\u2019Apple furent, en 1999, les premiers ordinateurs \u00e0 proposer un \u00e9quipement Wi-Fi[25] int\u00e9gr\u00e9 (sous le nom d\u2019AirPort), bient\u00f4t suivis par le reste de la gamme. D'autres ordinateurs commencent ensuite \u00e0 \u00eatre vendus avec des cartes Wi-Fi int\u00e9gr\u00e9es tandis que les plus anciens doivent s\u2019\u00e9quiper d\u2019une carte Wi-Fi externe adapt\u00e9e (PCMCIA, USB, CompactFlash, PCI, MiniPCI,\u00a0etc.). \u00c0 partir de 2003, on voit aussi appara\u00eetre des ordinateurs portables int\u00e9grant la plate-forme Intel Centrino, qui permet une int\u00e9gration simplifi\u00e9e du Wi-Fi[26].\n Les PDA eurent \u00e9galement des cartes Wi-Fi int\u00e9gr\u00e9es dans la fin des ann\u00e9es 1990, principalement Palm OS et Windows Mobile.\n Le risque le plus \u00e9voqu\u00e9 est un acc\u00e8s indu par un tiers \u00e0 des donn\u00e9es relevant de la vie priv\u00e9e ou du secret industriel ou commercial,\u00a0etc.\n Un autre risque pour le d\u00e9tenteur d'un point d'acc\u00e8s est de voir engager sa responsabilit\u00e9 si ce point est utilis\u00e9 pour r\u00e9aliser des actions ill\u00e9gales comme le partage ill\u00e9gal de copies prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par le droit d'auteur[27]\u00a0; probl\u00e8me qui se pose principalement lorsque le point d'acc\u00e8s n'est pas s\u00e9curis\u00e9. L'acc\u00e8s sans fil aux r\u00e9seaux locaux rend n\u00e9cessaire l'\u00e9laboration d'une politique de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, dans les entreprises et chez les particuliers notamment.\n Enfin il semble possible de voir \u00e0 travers les murs en utilisant le Wi-fi[28], En 2017, deux universitaires allemands ont montr\u00e9[29],[30],[31] qu'une analyse des ondes relictuelles de l'\u00e9metteur radio d'un routeur sans fil faite \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur d'une pi\u00e8ce ou d'un b\u00e2timent pourrait th\u00e9oriquement permettre de coder une image 3D (de type hologramme) de l'int\u00e9rieur d'une pi\u00e8ce en utilisant uniquement les signaux Wi-Fi qui \u00ab\u00a0fuient\u00a0\u00bb au travers des murs, portes, fen\u00eatres, toitures. Mais avec des r\u00e9sultats grossiers en utilisant les moyens techniques disponibles, et \u00e0 condition que la pi\u00e8ce ne soit pas encombr\u00e9e. Cette id\u00e9e est n\u00e9e d'une conversation o\u00f9 les interlocuteurs cherchaient \u00e0 imaginer ce qu'on verrait du monde si on le regardait en voyant les ondes Wi-Fi, ce qui les a conduits \u00e0 imaginer une vision holographique induite par le Wi-Fi. Une exp\u00e9rience a ainsi permis de repr\u00e9senter grossi\u00e8rement l'image (\u00e0 tr\u00e8s basse r\u00e9solution[32]) d'une croix en aluminium de 1\u00a0m de haut plac\u00e9e dans une pi\u00e8ce[33].\n Il est possible de choisir la m\u00e9thode de codage de la communication sur l'interface radio. La plus ancienne \u00e9tait l'utilisation d'une cl\u00e9 dite Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), communiqu\u00e9e uniquement aux utilisateurs autoris\u00e9s du r\u00e9seau. Toutefois, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que cette cl\u00e9 \u00e9tait facile \u00e0 violer[34], avec l'aide de programmes tels que Aircrack.\n Pour am\u00e9liorer la confidentialit\u00e9, de nouvelles m\u00e9thodes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9es, comme Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), WPA2 ou plus r\u00e9cemment WPA3.\n Depuis l'adoption du standard 802.11i, on peut raisonnablement parler d'acc\u00e8s r\u00e9seau sans fil s\u00e9curis\u00e9. En l'absence de 802.11i, on peut utiliser un tunnel chiffr\u00e9 (VPN) pour se raccorder au r\u00e9seau de son entreprise sans risque d'\u00e9coute ou de modification.\nD'autres m\u00e9thodes de s\u00e9curisation existent, avec, par exemple, un serveur Radius ou Diameter charg\u00e9 de g\u00e9rer les acc\u00e8s par nom d'utilisateur et par mot de passe.\n Le Wi-Fi appara\u00eet quand naissent des interrogations sur l'impact des radiofr\u00e9quences sur la sant\u00e9 humaine ou les \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes. Des d\u00e9bats scientifiques se sont multipli\u00e9s autour du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone mobile, puis des technologies radio reposant sur les micro-ondes, notamment les technologies GSM, WiMAX, UMTS (la 3G), HSDPA (la 3G+), le LTE (4G) ou encore le DECT et le Wi-Fi.\n Les ondes Wi-Fi sont maintenant presque omnipr\u00e9sentes dans l'environnement humain. Mais leur fr\u00e9quence relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9e (2,4\u00a0GHz et 5\u00a0GHz) les font mal traverser les murs. En outre, la puissance des \u00e9quipements Wi-Fi (~30\u00a0mW) est en moyenne vingt fois moindre que celle des t\u00e9l\u00e9phones mobiles (~600\u00a0mW)[35]. De plus, le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tenu pr\u00e8s du cerveau, ce qui n'est pas le cas de certains \u00e9quipements \u00e9mettant des ondes Wi-Fi (les box internet ou les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones avec micro et \u00e9couteur filaires). \u00c0 une dizaine de centim\u00e8tres, la densit\u00e9 de puissance du signal est d\u00e9j\u00e0 fortement att\u00e9nu\u00e9e\u00a0; pour une antenne isotrope, elle est inversement proportionnelle au carr\u00e9 de la distance\u00a0:\n avec PIRE [W] = puissance isotrope rayonn\u00e9e \u00e9quivalente. Dans les deux cas (t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et Wi-Fi), il faut prendre en compte le fait qu'ils \u00e9mettent 24\u00a0h sur 24 ou pas, et si on passe beaucoup de temps pr\u00e8s de la source.\n Les \u00ab\u00a0effets thermiques\u00a0\u00bb des ondes Wi-Fi sont reconnus n\u00e9gligeables[36]. Mais depuis le d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 2010, une exposition croissante et presque constante des humains a justifi\u00e9 de nombreuses \u00e9tudes nouvelles, dont certaines d\u00e9tectent des effets non-thermiques. L'importance sanitaire ou \u00e9cologique de ces effets (voire leur existence dans certains cas) sont par contre encore en d\u00e9bat en 2020.\n Dans un premier temps, elles ont majoritairement conclu qu'il n'y avait pas ou peu de risques sanitaires, dans le cadre d'une utilisation normale. Parmi ces organismes, on peut citer\u00a0:\n Des \u00e9tudes ont trouv\u00e9 que le Wi-Fi peut avoir des effets biologiques non-thermiques.\n Une \u00e9tude r\u00e9trospective de 2018 portant sur 23 autres \u00e9tudes, sur le mod\u00e8le animal, des cultures cellulaires (dont humaines) et/ou sur l'\u00eatre humain, estimait dans le journal Environmental Research que le Wi-Fi peut induire\u00a0:\n M.L. Pal note que la plupart de ces effets ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9s pour des expositions \u00e0 d'autres champs \u00e9lectromagn\u00e9tiques en hyperfr\u00e9quences (au sens anglophone du terme)[70]. Selon lui, l'activation des canaux calciques d\u00e9pendants du voltage, l'un des premiers effets d\u00e9crit, serait le m\u00e9canisme d'action pr\u00e9dominant des CEM sur les cellules vivantes, expliquant d'autres des effets des CEM, m\u00eame si d'autres m\u00e9canismes semblent aussi en cause (ex\u00a0: activation d'autres canaux ioniques voltage-d\u00e9pendants, r\u00e9sonance cyclotronique calcique et m\u00e9canisme de magn\u00e9tor\u00e9ception g\u00e9omagn\u00e9tique).Comme d'autres, il rappelle que les EMF[Quoi\u00a0?] puls\u00e9s[Quoi\u00a0?] semblent presque toujours biologiquement plus actifs que les EMF non-puls\u00e9s\u00a0; ajoutant que les champs \u00e9lectromagn\u00e9tiques artificiels sont polaris\u00e9s, ce qui pourrait les rendre beaucoup plus actifs que les champs \u00e9lectromagn\u00e9tiques non-polaris\u00e9s. Des courbes dose-r\u00e9ponse semblent exister, mais non-lin\u00e9aires et non monotones\u00a0; Les effets des CEM pourraient \u00eatre cumulatifs et les jeunes pourraient y \u00eatre plus vuln\u00e9rables que les adultes.\n En 2018, Martin L. Pal reproche \u00e0 F&M (Foster & Moulder) (qu'il juge proches de l'Industrie), d'avoir affirm\u00e9[71] qu'il n'existait que sept \u00e9tudes importantes sur le Wi-Fi, montrant toutes une absence d'effet Or, selon Martin L. Pal \u00ab\u00a0aucune de celles-ci n'\u00e9tait des \u00e9tudes sur le Wi-Fi, chacune diff\u00e9rant du Wi-Fi authentique de trois mani\u00e8res distinctes. F&M pouvaient tout au plus conclure qu'il n'y avait aucune preuve statistiquement significative d'un effet. Les petits nombres \u00e9tudi\u00e9s dans chacune de ces sept \u00e9tudes li\u00e9es \u00e0 F&M montrent que chacune d'elles n'a pas le pouvoir de tirer des conclusions substantielles\u00a0\u00bb[72].\n De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l'OMS a dans un premier temps (en mai 2006), suivi les avis de l'ICNIRP) et estim\u00e9 que l'exposition prolong\u00e9e aux ondes du Wi-Fi ne pr\u00e9sentait aucun risque pour la sant\u00e9[73], puis en mai 2011 elle a inclus le Wi-Fi (et la t\u00e9l\u00e9phonie mobile) dans la liste des \u00e9l\u00e9ments possiblement canc\u00e9rig\u00e8nes pour l'\u00eatre humain (groupe 2B).\n En 2020, les effets non thermiques \u00e9tant encore ni\u00e9s ou minor\u00e9s par les acteurs industriels (ou l'ICNIRP), les conclusions en termes de recommandations restent controvers\u00e9es, et elle \u00e9voluent (\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des enfants notamment)\u00a0; ainsi, le Wi-Fi a \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement d\u00e9conseill\u00e9, voire interdit dans des \u00e9coles au Royaume-Uni, en Allemagne et en Autriche et dans certains \u00c9tats des \u00c9tats-Unis.\n Au nom du principe de pr\u00e9caution, certains[Qui\u00a0?] recommandent de d\u00e9sactiver le Wi-Fi de sa box autant que possible[80].\n Le Wi-Fi utilise principalement les bandes de fr\u00e9quence dites \u00ab\u00a0industrielle, scientifique et m\u00e9dicale\u00a0\u00bb, ISM, de 2,4 \u00e0 2,483\u00a05\u00a0GHz et de 5,150\u00a0GHz \u00e0 5,850\u00a0GHz, partag\u00e9es avec d'autres types d'usages, ce qui peut conduire \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes d'interf\u00e9rences et de brouillages caus\u00e9s par des fours \u00e0 micro-ondes, des transmetteurs domestiques, des relais, la t\u00e9l\u00e9mesure, la t\u00e9l\u00e9m\u00e9decine, la t\u00e9l\u00e9-identification, les cam\u00e9ras sans fil, le Bluetooth, les \u00e9missions de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision amateur (amateur TV ou ATV),\u00a0etc. Inversement, des syst\u00e8mes tels que la radio-identification (RFID) tendent \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter les usages du Wi-Fi pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de son infrastructure d\u00e9j\u00e0 en place, notamment pour la g\u00e9olocalistaion[81],[82].\n En Wi-Fi, il est recommand\u00e9 de ne pas utiliser la m\u00eame fr\u00e9quence que celle utilis\u00e9e par les voisins imm\u00e9diats (collisions) et de ne pas utiliser une fr\u00e9quence trop proche (interf\u00e9rences). Voir aussi la liste des canaux Wi-Fi.\n Cette technologie peut ouvrir les portes \u00e0 un grand nombre d\u2019applications pratiques. Elle peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e avec de l\u2019IPv4, ou de l\u2019IPv6, et permet le d\u00e9veloppement de nouveaux algorithmes distribu\u00e9s[83].\n Les utilisateurs des hotspots peuvent se connecter dans des caf\u00e9s, des h\u00f4tels, des a\u00e9roports,\u00a0etc. et acc\u00e9der \u00e0 Internet mais aussi b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de tous les services li\u00e9s \u00e0 Internet (World Wide Web, courrier \u00e9lectronique, t\u00e9l\u00e9phonie (VoIP), t\u00e9l\u00e9phonie mobile (VoIP mobile), t\u00e9l\u00e9chargements,\u00a0etc.). Cet acc\u00e8s est utilisable de fa\u00e7on fixe, mais parfois \u00e9galement en situation de mobilit\u00e9 (exemple\u00a0: le hotspot disponible dans les trains Thalys).\n Les hotspots Wi-Fi contribuent \u00e0 constituer ce que l'on peut appeler un \u00ab\u00a0r\u00e9seau pervasif\u00a0\u00bb. En anglais, \u00ab\u00a0pervasive\u00a0\u00bb signifie \u00ab\u00a0omnipr\u00e9sent\u00a0\u00bb. Le r\u00e9seau pervasif est un r\u00e9seau dans lequel nous sommes connect\u00e9s, partout, tout le temps si nous le voulons, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de nos objets communicants classiques (ordinateurs, t\u00e9l\u00e9phones) mais aussi, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des objets multiples \u00e9quip\u00e9s d\u2019une capacit\u00e9 de m\u00e9moire et d\u2019intelligence\u00a0: syst\u00e8mes de positionnement GPS pour voiture, jouets, lampes, appareils m\u00e9nagers,\u00a0etc. Ces objets dits \u00ab\u00a0intelligents\u00a0\u00bb sont d\u2019ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sents autour de nous et le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9velopper avec le d\u00e9veloppement du r\u00e9seau pervasif. \u00c0 observer ce qui se passe au Japon, aux \u00c9tats-Unis mais aussi en France, l\u2019objet communicant est un levier de croissance pour tout type d\u2019industrie.\n En parall\u00e8le des acc\u00e8s classiques de type hotspot, le Wi-Fi peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour la technologie de dernier kilom\u00e8tre dans les zones rurales, coupl\u00e9 \u00e0 des technologies de collecte de type satellite, fibre optique, WiMAX ou liaison lou\u00e9e.\n Les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones et smartphones Wi-Fi (GSM, UMTS, DECT) utilisant la technologie VoIP sont devenus tr\u00e8s courants.\n \u00c0 Paris, il existe un r\u00e9seau important de plusieurs centaines de caf\u00e9s offrant aux consommateurs une connexion Wi-Fi gratuite. Depuis juillet 2007, Paris WI-FI propose gratuitement \u00e0 Paris 400 points d\u2019acc\u00e8s dans 260 lieux municipaux.\n Les op\u00e9rateurs de r\u00e9seau mobile offrent souvent des solutions permettant aux t\u00e9l\u00e9phones mobiles d'utiliser, de fa\u00e7on transparente pour l'utilisateur, les hotspots Wi-Fi disponibles \u00e0 proximit\u00e9, qu'il s'agisse de nouvelles versions de hot-spots publics, de terminaux fixes (box) des abonn\u00e9s du fournisseur, voire dans le cadre d'une interop\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 entre fournisseurs. L'objectif est de faciliter l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'internet mobile et vise \u00e0 d\u00e9-congestionner la bande passante utilis\u00e9e par les r\u00e9seaux 3G et 4G[84].\n Les antennes Wi-Fi \u00e0 couverture omnidirectionnelles ou h\u00e9misph\u00e9riques sont quantitativement les plus r\u00e9pandues\u00a0; elles sont notamment utilis\u00e9es dans les hotspots Wi-Fi et dans les smartphones. Dans ce groupe d'antennes plusieurs types existent\u00a0:\n Les deux premiers types fonctionnent en polarisation V\u00a0; elles peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des antennes de stations d\u2019accueil ou de base puisque compatibles avec un environnement 360\u00b0.\n Les antennes \u00e0 gain directionnelles ou omnidirectionnelles sont destin\u00e9es \u00e0 la \u00ab\u00a0plus longue port\u00e9e\u00a0\u00bb, possible, quelques kilom\u00e8tres.\n Les antennes panneaux et paraboliques sont uniquement directionnelles, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elles favorisent une direction privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e (plus ou moins ouverte) au d\u00e9triment d\u2019autres non souhait\u00e9es.\n Les antennes panneaux sont souvent pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es (voire pr\u00e9f\u00e9rables) lorsque le bilan de liaison est favorable, mais, d\u00e8s que le syst\u00e8me doit \u00eatre plus performant, les paraboles deviennent n\u00e9cessaires. Le point d\u2019\u00e9quilibre, \u00e0 21\u00a0dBi, se fait avec d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 un panneau carr\u00e9 de 45\u00a0cm et de l\u2019autre une parabole d\u00a0=\u00a065\u00a0cm.\n En conclusion, en directionnel, ou point \u00e0 point, il est plus int\u00e9ressant de s\u2019\u00e9quiper d\u2019abord d\u2019un panneau, puis, si les circonstances l\u2019exigent, d\u2019une parabole.\n Les antennes Wi-Fi sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement dot\u00e9es de connecteurs SMA, RP-SMA (reverse polarity SMA), ou N selon le constructeur. Cependant, les antennes \u00e0 gain (exprim\u00e9 en dBi ou en dBd) employ\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9mission (r\u00e9ception libre) doivent respecter la r\u00e9glementation PIRE (puissance isotrope rayonn\u00e9e \u00e9quivalente).\n Il existe d\u2019autres antennes, moins connues, et celles con\u00e7ues par les wifistes, comme l\u2019antenne cornet, les antennes 2,5\u00a0GHz de r\u00e9alisation amateur, les Yagi, les corni\u00e8res, les di\u00e8dres, les \u00ab\u00a0discones\u00a0\u00bb,\u00a0etc. mais seules les tiges, les panneaux et les paraboles sont significativement utilis\u00e9es.\n Pour am\u00e9liorer les \u00e9changes, il peut \u00eatre mont\u00e9 au plus pr\u00e8s de l\u2019antenne un pr\u00e9amplificateur d\u2019antenne (RX) avec ou sans ampli de puissance mais toujours de type bidirectionnel.\n * Certains passages de cet article, ou d\u2019une version ant\u00e9rieure de cet article, sont bas\u00e9s sur l\u2019article Introduction au Wi-Fi (802.11) du site Web Comment \u00e7a marche\u00a0?.

Often, these happen when we\u2019re writing emails or texting someone. Luckily, the predictive text has become a feature that many of us rely on during these times. Whether you love it or hate it, it\u2019s a widget that might have helped you at least once or twice. In this article, we\u2019ll be looking at how predictive text works and how to use it. \u00a0 Predictive text is an input technology that suggests words that the user might want to use or insert in a text field. These predictions are usually based on how the other words in the sentence are used and the first letter that you\u2019ve typed. If your chosen word appears in the suggestions, you can simply tap on it to use.\u00a0 Once you have it on your keyboard, you can use it in your messaging apps and even your productivity apps.\u00a0 This technology was intended to speed up the input process and make typing more efficient. It is, however, still error-prone and would require continuous use to make it more accurate.\u00a0 Predictive text is a function that most modern devices already have and it can be disabled should the user want to do so.\u00a0 Also read: How to Turn Off Autocorrect that Fails \u00a0 Many know the basic function of predictive text but not a lot of people know how this type of technology truly works. Despite being a form of sophisticated technology, it is still widely error-ridden, which often leads users to simply disable the function. But before you hit disable, here\u2019s a quick overview of how predictive text works.\u00a0 Predictive text curates its predictions on texts that you use over time. It builds its glossary of words based on words and phrases that you type repeatedly. The system will then work to score these words by the probability of when you\u2019ll use it again.\u00a0 If predictive text offers you a word, you can either accept its correction, ignore the word, or even add a new word to your dictionary so that the system won\u2019t correct you again. It\u2019s recommended that you add a word to your dictionary so that it doesn\u2019t get flagged repeatedly.\u00a0 Should you decide to accept correction, the keyboard will assume that the word you typed is wrong and will continue to offer corrections once you type it again. If you choose to ignore a word, the keyboard will assume that it is not wrong but not a word that you often use. The more you use that word, your keyboard will think it might be a probable choice and present you with it the next time you type a similar sentence or word.\u00a0\u00a0 If a word is added to your dictionary, the keyboard will automatically \u201clearn\u201d it. The predictive text will offer it as an option if you enter a pattern similar to the keys or if you use a similar sentence pattern.\u00a0 Again, it\u2019s best to keep in mind that while the predictive text is a modern function, it\u2019s still not perfect and will rely on how you use it to make it function properly for you. \u00a0  Now that you have an idea of how the predictive text works, here is a quick guide on how to use it on your mobile phones. We included guides for both Android and iPhone so that you won\u2019t have a hard time! On a quick note, you might want to update your software first for a better experience. If you\u2019re unsure of how to do that, don\u2019t worry! You can check out our in-depth guides on how to update to Apple iOS 13 and Android 10. \u00a0 New mobile phones or those that have been recently factory reset will have predictive text on by default. But if it doesn\u2019t or if you\u2019ve disabled it, here\u2019s how you can turn it back on again.\u00a0 For Android users, go to Settings > General Management > Keyboards. From there, choose your default keyboard and then toggle the predictive text option to turn it on.\u00a0 Take note that on some versions of Android, keyboard management will be under Additional Settings. Simply go to Settings > Additional Settings > Languages & Input. From there, just choose your keyboard and toggle your settings. For iPhone users, simply go to Settings > General > Keyboard. The settings are turned on by default but you can always toggle the switches to change them. \u00a0 If predictive text is just not for you and if its auto-correct fails, you can always opt to turn it off or disable it.\u00a0 For Android, go to Settings > General Management > Keyboards. Simply choose the keyboard that you\u2019re using and a menu will appear. You\u2019ll be able to disable the predictive text from there.\u00a0 If you\u2019re running on Android 10 or it\u2019s predecessors, you can find your keyboard settings at Settings > Additional Settings > Languages & Input. Once you\u2019re at the Languages & Input menu, simply select your keyboard and toggle your settings. For iPhone, go to Settings > General > Keyboard. From there, all you have to do is toggle the switch to disable Predictive text. If you\u2019re in the middle of typing, you can also opt to disable predictive text from your keyboard. Simply touch and hold the emoji or language button. A menu should appear and you can head to your keyboard settings from there. \u00a0 Predictive text learns from how you type over time, as such, you might want to clear it from time to time to get a clean slate and start a new dictionary. It\u2019s also a great idea to clear out your dictionary if you plan to give away or sell your phone for good measure.\u00a0 For Android, simply head to your Keyboard menu and choose your default keyboard. From there, simply tap \u201cReset to default settings\u201d then tap \u201cErase personalized predictions.\u201d Your Predictive keyboard should go back to its original settings.\u00a0 For iPhone, go to Settings > General > Reset. There, tap on \u201cReset Keyboard Dictionary\u201d and you will be prompted to confirm your decision. All that\u2019s left to do is input your passcode if needed, otherwise, you\u2019re entire keyboard dictionary will be reset. \u00a0 If you happen to use a word repeatedly and your keyboard is still correcting you, you can manually add it to your dictionary instead of waiting for the system to automatically learn it.\u00a0 Android users have two options on how they want to go about it. The easiest method is for you to type down the word and long-press it. You will be prompted to add this word to your dictionary.\u00a0 The second option is for you to go to your keyboard menu and edit your keyboard dictionary from there. While you can do both methods, it\u2019s recommended that you do the first one as it saves more time and won\u2019t interrupt you if you\u2019re typing a message.\u00a0 For iPhone, you can just type down the word that you want to add. Wait for the dotted red line or the correction line to appear and tap on the word and tap \u201cLearn Spelling.\u201d In some versions, you may be required to tap \u201cReplace\u201d first before the \u201cLearn Spelling\u201d option appears. \u00a0 Just like any other gadget or app, using your phone\u2019s predictive text also has pros and cons. For some, predictive text can be very helpful in their everyday lives but others beg to differ. Before deciding where you stand, here are a couple of pros and cons to consider when using Predictive text. PROS CONS Remember that, at the end of the day, the good and the bad will always depend on how you use the widget and how much you rely on it. \u00a0 In general, predictive text is a helpful function if you want or need to type your messages faster as it will prompt words that you can use. However, it can also be disruptive especially if it doesn\u2019t recognize words that you need to use and corrects you every time that you type an unfamiliar word. It also doesn\u2019t help when you accidentally press the word given by the predictive text even though you didn\u2019t intend to use it.\u00a0 Regardless, always remember that it will learn from you and the way that you type in the long run. It\u2019s a function that will only get better the longer that you use it. You can always make it better by leaving it on and letting it learn as you type. Adding words do your dictionary will also keep them from getting repeatedly flagged. Ultimately, Predictive text is a function that can be a hit or miss for most users. Some prefer to leave it on and others just don\u2019t want to have it there. Like most widgets, it\u2019s recommended that you use it based on your personal needs and preferences.\u00a0 This website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible.

Learn how the long-coming and inevitable shift to electric impacts you.\n \nWhether you want to build your own home theater or just learn more about TVs, displays, projectors, and more, we've got you covered.\n \nGet tech's top stories in 30 seconds:\n \n4G and 4G LTE wireless service providers like to talk about their super-speedy 4G wireless networks, but just how fast is 4G compared to 3G? 4G wireless delivers service is at least 10 times faster than 3G networks and much faster than that, in many cases.\n \nSpeeds vary by your location, provider, mobile network load, and device. If you live in a large city, the speed is usually higher than the speed available in remote areas of the country.\n All of the\u00a0information below should apply\u00a0to iPhone and Android phones (no matter which company made your Android phone, including Samsung, Google, Huawei, Xiaomi, etc). \n4G is the fourth generation of mobile network technology. It replaces 3G and is more reliable and much faster than its predecessor. It accommodates streaming media on your\u00a0phone, where its speed\u00a0means you won't see any buffering delays. It is considered a necessity, rather than a luxury, for use with the high-powered smartphones on the market.\n \nSome people use the terms 4G and 4G LTE interchangeably, but 4G LTE, which stands for the fourth generation long-term\u00a0evolution, delivers the best performance and fastest speeds. 4G is offered in most areas of the country now, but 4G LTE is not as widely available. Even if your provider offers 4G LTE speed, you must have a compatible phone to access it. Most older phones can't accommodate 4G LTE speeds.\n \n4G LTE networks are fast\u2014so fast, that when you use one on your phone to access the internet, you enjoy an experience similar to that provided by a home router.\n \nIn addition to its high speed, which makes streaming video, movies, and music possible, 4G LTE service offers some other advantages, particularly when compared with Wi-Fi networks:\n \nIn all cases, download speed is faster than upload speed. These 4G speed measurements are reported as what the average users can expect. They may or may not be reflected in your device given your service area, network load,\u00a0and phone or tablet capabilities.\n \nThe 4G speeds are expressed in megabits per second\u00a0(Mbps).\n \nT-Mobile has a reputation for performing well in metropolitan areas, although its speed is known to drop indoors.\n \n5G is the newest mobile network technology. It promises to be 10 times faster than 4G service. 5G will differ from 4G in that it is designed to use radio frequencies broken into bands. The frequencies are higher than those used by 4G networks and have been expanded to handle the large number of bandwidth demands the future will bring.\n \nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day \nHit Refresh on Your Tech News"], "http://hmn.plmen-battery.com/3050-4000mah/": [""], "https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ogg-file-2622795": [" \nEVs have been around a long time but are quickly gaining speed in the automotive industry. Learn how the long-coming and inevitable shift to electric impacts you.\n \nWhether you want to build your own home theater or just learn more about TVs, displays, projectors, and more, we've got you covered.\n \nGet tech's top stories in 30 seconds:\n \nJump to a Section \nThis article explains two formats that use the OGG file extension, including how to open and convert both types.\n \nA file with the OGG file extension is an Ogg Vorbis compressed uudio file used for holding audio data. They can include artist and track information.\n \nThe word \"Vorbis\" pertains to the encoding scheme provided by the developers of the OGG format, Xiph.org. OGG files that aren't considered Vorbis can include other audio compression types like FLAC and Speex, and may use the .OGA file extension.\n \nIf not an audio file, the OGG file could instead be an Origin graph file. This type isn't played in a media player, but instead opened with a graphing program.\n \nLots of music players and audio software can play OGG files, such as VLC, Miro, Windows Media Player (with Directshow filter), MPlayer, Xion Audio Player, Audials One, and Adobe Audition. You can also play OGG files online through Google Drive.\n \nSome of those programs can open this file type on Macs, too, including Roxio Toast and Elmedia Player. Programs like Miro and VLC support playback on Linux, as well as Zinf, Totem, and Amarok.\n \nGPS devices and other media players probably support this format, but Apple devices don't. This means you have to install an app like VLC or OPlayer HD to play OGG files on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.\n \nIf you open an online OGG file or drag a local one into Chrome, you can play the file without having to download a separate program. Opera and Firefox can stream OGG files, too.\n \nOrigin is the program needed to open OGG files that are graph files. Origin Viewer is a free program from the same company that develops Origin, that lets you view and copy information from an OGG file.\n Modern versions of Origin (beginning in v2018) save graphs in the OGGU format instead, but the same viewer program, as well as Origin and Origin Pro, can open that format, too. \nSome free audio file converters let you convert an OGG file to MP3, WAV, MP4, and other similar formats. The easiest way is to use an online converter like FileZigZag or Zamzar.\n \nFor example, you can convert OGG files online with FileZigZag to several formats in addition to the ones just mentioned, like WMA, OPUS, M4R, M4A, AAC, and AIFF. Zamzar works the same way.\n \nYou can also convert OGG files with a downloadable program if you'd rather not upload your files online, or if you need to convert in bulk. Through the free audio file converters link mentioned above, you can find converters like Free Audio Converter and MediaHuman Audio Converter.\n \nOrigin OGG files can be saved to OTP with the Origin program, through File > Save Template As. This produces an Origin Graph Template file.\n \nIf your file isn't opening with the suggestions from above, make sure the file extension says .OGG and not something similar like these:\n \nEven though those, and probably many others, share some of the same file extension letters as OGG files, it doesn't mean they're related at all or that they can be opened or converted with the same programs. They might be able to, but chances are good that you need to research those file formats specifically in order to see which applications were built to open them.\n \nOGG Vorbis also functions as a container format meant to replace the OGG format. It can hold streams of audio, video, and subtitles or other text. These types of multiplexed media files use the OGX file extension.\n \nOGG Vorbis multiplexed media files and can be opened with VLC, Windows Media Player, and QuickTime.\n \nThe OGG media file format that uses the .OGM file extension is a bit different from the other formats mentioned above. While it, too, can be played with VLC and older versions of Windows Media Player, Xiph.org doesn't support the format because it doesn't fall within the boundaries of the OGG specification.\n \nThe MOGG file extension is used in some video games when multiple OGG files are stored in the same file.\n With Zamzar's OGG converter, you can convert over 40 file formats to OGG, including AAC and MIDI files. When you're ready, click Choose Files to pick what to convert > select Convert To and pick ogg > and then click Convert Now. Use the FileZigZag OGG-to-MP3 free online converter. Select Browse for Files or drag and drop the OGG file to the designated area. Next, select Start Converting > Download. Go to the file browser in the Blender software > select File > Open > and choose the OGG file to import. You can also use the Ctrl+O keyboard shortcut to open an OGG file in Blender. \nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day \nHit Refresh on Your Tech News"], "https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/asus-splendid-missing-icm-file-in-windows-10/e9bd4f3c-7518-475d-81f8-80f6c035f563": [""], "https://www.howtogeek.com/224616/30-ways-windows-10-phones-home/": [" Join 425,000 subscribers and get a daily digest of news, geek trivia, and our feature articles.

Windows 10 phones home more than any other version of Windows before it. Along with Windows 10, Microsoft released a new privacy policy and services agreement containing 45 pages of legalese. If Google wrote these, Microsoft might say you were being \u201cScroogled.\u201d RELATED: Why Microsoft's Scroogled Ads Are Wrong About Chromebooks Like it or not, Microsoft isn\u2019t alone here. What Windows 10 is doing has become common and normal across the web, Android, iOS, and other modern platforms. Microsoft is hoovering up all the\u00a0data it can get to better target ads, personalize the operating system, and improve its software and services. Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0almost everything is sending back data to somewhere \u2014 for instance, if you are using Chrome, everything you search for is sent back to Google. Ad networks are tracking you on every website (including this one). Facebook and Amazon have ad systems that border on creepy. We\u2019re not necessarily condemning Microsoft with this article, but with all the recent interest in privacy and Windows 10, we decided to build a list of all the things being sent back in Windows 10 and let you decide what you think. RELATED: What\u2019s the Difference Between Windows 10\u2019s Express or Custom Setup? You can actually change many of these options right after\u00a0the installation process if you select \u201cCustomize settings\u201d instead of \u201cUse express settings.\u201d However, most people will probably click right through and use the express settings.\u00a0This\u00a0activates a lot of features that share data with Microsoft. You\u2019ll find a lot of these features under Privacy in the new Settings app. (Click the Start button, click Settings, and select Privacy.) Some of the options here simply control\u00a0which apps have access to different data \u2014 for example, which apps can control your webcam. Others allow you to set system-wide privacy options. Under General, you\u2019ll find:  You\u2019ll see a \u201cManage my Microsoft advertising and other personalization info\u201d link at the bottom here. Click it, and then click over to \u201cPersonalized ad preferences\u201d on the web page that appears.\u00a0You can also access this page at https://choice.microsoft.com/en-us/opt-out .  The Location screen activates location services. This isn\u2019t mentioned on the Location Settings window itself, but the\u00a0custom setup screen states\u00a0this will also \u201csend Microsoft and trusted partners some location data to improve location services.\u201d  The \u201cSpeech, inking, & typing\u201d section covers a surprising amount of data:   The \u201cFeedback & diagnostics\u201d setting has a surprising option. What\u2019s especially surprising is Windows 10 won\u2019t actually let you disable this option.  RELATED: How to Disable Bing in the Windows 10 Start Menu Obviously, when you use Microsoft\u2019s built-in Cortana assistant, Cortana requires a lot of your information to function.  RELATED: Here's Why Windows 8.1's Encryption Doesn't Seem to Scare the FBI This part carries forward from Windows 8.1. If you buy a new device and it has the required hardware \u2014 as most new Windows 8.1 and 10 devices do \u2014 it\u2019s automatically encrypted with BitLocker-like encryption known as \u201cdevice encryption.\u201d You can avoid this by not logging in with a Microsoft account, but then your device won\u2019t be encrypted at all. if you\u2019d rather not do this, you can upgrade to a Professional edition of Windows and use the standard BitLocker feature. BitLocker will ask if you want to store your recovery key with Microsoft for safekeeping, but that\u2019s optional. You can find these keys at https://onedrive.live.com/recoverykey.  RELATED: How to Use the Built-in Windows Defender Antivirus on Windows 10 Windows 10 includes the Windows Defender antivirus, and it\u2019s enabled right out of the box. This is the successor to the Microsoft Security Essentials antivirus that was available for free on Windows 7. Settings for this are available under Update & security > Windows Defender in the Settings app. Windows Defender will automatically enable real-time protection. Even if you turn it off, it\u2019s only temporary \u2014 it will turn that real-time antivirus protection back on later. The only real way to turn it off is to install a third-party antivirus. Windows Defender won\u2019t run if another antivirus is running.  RELATED: How the SmartScreen Filter Works in Windows 8 and 10 Windows 10 also includes the SmartScreen filter introduced in Windows 8. When you run an application downloaded from the Internet, SmartScreen checks in with Microsoft\u2019s servers to\u00a0check that application\u2019s reputation.\u00a0If it\u2019s a known-good application, Windows 10 will run it normally. if it\u2019s a known-bad application, Windows 10 will block it. If it\u2019s unknown, Windows 10 will warn you and get your permission before running it.  RELATED: 11 Tips and Tricks for Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 SmartScreen and Cortana are also part of Microsoft Edge, Windows 10\u2019s\u00a0new web browser. You\u2019ll find the privacy related options under the menu in Edge \u2014 select Settings and then select \u201cView advanced settings.\u201d If you choose to save other types of data in Edge, it will be synced online with your Microsoft account.  RELATED: Disable and Remove Suggested Sites From Internet Explorer 8 Internet Explorer is still around, although it\u2019s not the default browser.  Windows 10 recommends you sign in with a Microsoft account, just like Windows 8. This allows you to log in with the same account you use for other Microsoft services like Outlook.com, Office 365, OneDrive, Skype, MSN, and other services. This also enables a lot of online features in Windows 10, like access to the Windows Store and many included apps that require a Microsoft account, OneDrive file access in File Explorer, and various sync features. You can choose to use a local user\u00a0account if you prefer.  As Microsoft puts it:\u00a0 \u201cWhen you\u2019re signed into your Microsoft account, Microsoft services like Bing, MSN, and Cortana personalize your experience.\u201d  RELATED: What You Need to Know About Windows Update on Windows 10 While it\u2019s not technically \u201cphoning home,\u201d Windows Update uses your upload bandwidth by default\u00a0to upload Windows Updates to other users. It\u2019s a bit like BitTorrent, and similar to how Blizzard\u2019s Battle.net downloader distributes game updates. These settings can be controlled under Settings > Update & security > Windows Update > Advanced options > Choose how updates are delivered. You can make Windows only share updates with PCs on your local network, not the entire Internet.  RELATED: What is Wi-Fi Sense and Why Does It Want Your Facebook Account? The Wi-Fi sense feature is enabled by default, and it will automatically connect to suggested open hotspots and networks your Outlook.com, Skype, and Facebook contacts have shared with you.  This is just a conservative list, and probably isn\u2019t complete.\u00a0There are many other ways Windows 10 arguably phones home. Windows 10 includes apps for a variety of Microsoft services: Cortana, Bing, Outlook.com, OneDrive, Groove Music, MSN, and Xbox. Each of these services may have its own privacy policy and store data about you in a different place if you use them. And, again, this isn\u2019t unusual in this day and age. Whether you love it or hate it \u2014 actually, it\u2019s more like you\u2019re indifferent to it or hate it \u2014 many operating systems and services now function this way. What\u2019s new here is Windows is jumping on board. Many of these features were already present in Windows 8 and 8.1, too. But Microsoft could certainly do a better job of putting these options in a single place and better explaining them, though. They\u2019re scattered not just across Windows 10\u2019s interface, but across a variety of different Microsoft websites.

You\u2019ve heard it in commercials, seen it plastered across billboards, and maybe even read about it in your cellphone plan. But what is 4G LTE, and how do its speeds and coverage compare\u00a0to other 3G and 4G\u00a0networks? To understand what LTE is\u2013beyond \u201ca really fast network\u201d\u2013we have to take a step back in time. You probably remember when the 3G, or 3rd generation, standard\u00a0was\u00a0a big deal in the 2000s\u2013it made accessing the internet on your phone significantly faster and more convenient. 3G is required to meet\u00a0IMT-2000 (International Mobile Telecommunications-2000) technical standards, which means a peak download rate of 200 Kbps, or 0.2 Mbps. This may seem slow to you now, but at the time, it was enough to get your email in a timely fashion. Logically, the next step after 3G\u2013the third generation of wireless mobile communications technology\u2013would be 4G, or the fourth generation. The the ITU Radiocommunications Sector (ITU-R)\u00a0set some requirements as to what would constitute a 4G network: it must\u00a0provide peak 100 Mbps downloads if you\u2019re using a mobile device such as a phone or tablet. More stationary devices, such as mobile hotspots, should provide peaks speeds of 1 Gbps.  In more recent years, 3G has made some advancements.\u00a0High Speed Packet Access\u00a0(HSPA), for example, can offer theoretical speeds up to 7.2 Mbps, and is often called 3.5G or Turbo 3G. Then came 4G, in the form of\u00a0Evolved High Speed Packet Access\u00a0(HSPA+) and Long-Term Evolution\u00a0(LTE). Both were\u00a0marketed this as \u201c4G\u201d, even though they\u00a0didn\u2019t meet the ITU\u2019s standards\u2013neither reached that 100 Mbps download rate. LTE, however, wasn\u2019t just another improvement of 3G. It was\u00a0meant to be more of an umbrella term\u00a0given to the technologies designed to get us to the 4G standard.\u00a0In other words, it\u2019s what 4G will be be when the technology evolves enough to provide those speeds. It\u2019s 4G-Eventually. As a way of compromising, the ITU-R decided that mobile carriers could market LTE (and HSPA) as 4G, since they represented a significant improvement over 3G and paved the way for true 4G speeds. Okay, we\u2019re done with the history lesson. Let\u2019s tackle the question that truly\u00a0matters: What kind of speeds does LTE actually offer right now?\u00a0Frankly, it depends on where you are and who you are using for your wireless service.  According to a report by Open Signal, the average LTE download speed in the US is 9.9 Mbps while the global average is 13.5 Mbps. That\u2019s far off the ideal 100 Mbps 4G standard, but a marked improvement over old 3G speeds. In a race between the big four US wireless carriers, even the highest average speed (Verizon) was just over 12 Mbps. Remember, that\u2019s an average. Your speed may be faster, or it could\u00a0be slower. As you can see to the right, I used\u00a0Speedtest app on my iPhone 6S\u00a0(which is\u00a0available for Android as well) on\u00a0T-Mobile in Florida, and mine were much higher (albeit\u00a0still\u00a0way below 100 Mbps). But it\u2019s not just about speed: coverage matters too. After all, if you never see that \u201cLTE\u201d icon in the menu bar of your phone, you won\u2019t ever get those highly-advertised speeds. Coverage depends on your carrier. Each of the four major US carriers\u2013AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile\u2013utilize different\u00a0frequency bands, which is how they separate their signals from one another. A frequency band is a group of radio frequencies mobile carriers thus use to communicate with clients, i.e. your smartphone, and vice-versa. LTE, in its current specification, allows carriers to deploy it on different frequency bandwidth blocks. In essence, a bandwidth block is how much space a carrier allocates to a network. Currently, both Verizon and T-Mobile have dedicated the widest\u00a0channels for their LTE from 10MHz to 15MHz, all the way up to 20MHz. Network coverage at lower frequencies, particularly the 700Mhz range, will provide LTE access in more locations such as buildings and sheltered areas. In fact, in terms of coverage\u2013measured by how much time subscribers are able to get an LTE signal, the top 3 carriers have almost reached parity. According to the oft-cited OpenSignal report, Verizon comes out on top, with nearly 87% coverage, followed by AT&T 82.6%, and T-Mobile at 81.2%. Sprint comes in a distant fourth at 70%. Remember, these show the proportion of time subscribers get an LTE signal, not a geographic percentage of land\u2013but that\u2019s still quite good. That\u2019s the present. So what about the future? Mobile speeds will no doubt continue to advance and gain speed. LTE Advanced is the new standard companies are hyping, which promises to finally deliver \u201cTrue 4G\u201d speeds. So basically, LTE Advanced is what 4G was supposed to be all along. 5G, meanwhile, will be the next logical step up from 4G. As you might guess, 5G stands for fifth generation, and is supposed to promise speeds up to 10 gigabits per seconds\u2013enough to download a full HD movie in mere seconds. Unlike LTE, which occupies lower frequency bands, 5G can\u00a0occupy both lower frequency bands and ultra-high bands. Using these higher bands\u00a0means 5G\u00a0won\u2019t travel as far as 4G LTE and will need to be boosted to make it practical to a wide audience. None of this matters much at this point however, as the technical standards are still being worked out and won\u2019t be finalized until 2020. For right now, 4G LTE is good enough for the vast majority of mobile users, and will be for some time. Logically, if or when True 4G or LTE Advanced becomes the norm, it will suffice for a time while mobile providers\u00a0roll out 5G and so on.

Interlink Electronics is known worldwide as the innovator of the Force Sensing Resistor (FSR). But today, we would like to focus the spotlight on another one of our core offerings\u2014the VersaPad line of resistive touchpads (also called trackpads). Capitalizing on our expertise in force detection, Interlink\u2019s first VersaPad model, released in the mid-1990s, distinguished itself from the rest of the touchpad pack by using pressure detection to register inputs. In the years since, we have released multiple iterations of the VersaPad\u2014consistently adding new features and improving performance\u2014culminating with last year\u2019s introduction of the VersaPad Plus. However, while the technology has evolved, the most fundamental advantages of resistive technology haven\u2019t changed. In this post, we will explain how resistive touchpads work, as well as their benefits and disadvantages when compared with their main alternative, capacitive touchpads. \u00a0 Resistive touchpads detect pressure exerted by the user on the device, either with their fingers or some intermediary like a stylus, to interpret position and movement\u2014providing functionality similar to that of a traditional mouse. The device\u2019s basic construction consists of two ultrathin resistive plates precisely positioned with a small separation between them. Each resistive plate is coated with one half of the circuit using proprietary functional materials. When pressure is applied to the surface of the VersaPad, the top layer deflects at the point of contact, causing the two plates to make contact and current to flow between the two halves of the circuit. Each of the two plates has an important job to do, with one registering the position of the press on the y-axis and the other tracking the x-axis. Amalgamating this feedback tells the system exactly where and how much force is being applied at any given time. This information can then be used as inputs for mousing and other human machine interface (HMI) applications. These devices are often put into laptops, used as standalone interfaces, or integrated into larger HMIs. However, the device\u2019s software can also be configured for applications beyond mousing, such as using it for joystick functionality or as a multifunction button. Resistive touchpads are extremely rugged, withstanding the effects of extreme temperatures, shocks, vibrations, contamination, and electromagnetic (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI)\u2014the latter two of which can be a major issue for capacitive sensing technology (our next subject of discussion) if not properly shielded. \u00a0 Capacitive touchpads detect contact by creating an electrostatic field along a conductive surface. When an object that has dielectric properties or conducts electricity\u2014like the skin on your finger\u2014interferes with this field through touch (or even just gets near enough to affect it), it reduces the system\u2019s capacitance at that point. The system then determines where this disturbance occurs along the pad\u2019s X and Y axes, which is translated into input data. This is the fundamental idea behind both surface and projected capacitive sensor\u2014though their construction, operation, and advantages vary somewhat. Capacitive touchpads are the chief alternative to resistive touchpads, and of the two, it is likely the technology that everyday consumers interact with the most\u2014personal laptop touchpads are usually capacitive, as are most smartphone screens. They are chosen for these applications because they generally feature higher input resolutions than resistive touchpads and don\u2019t require the user to keep pressure on the screen, giving them a bit more of an intuitive feel. There was also a time when capacitive technology offered features that could not be replicated on resistive touchpads\u2014such as multi-touch controls\u2014although advancements in technology have closed the gap on many of these advantages. Beyond features and capabilities, another factor to consider is customizability and cost. If your application requires a solution with special dimensions, integration requirements, or interconnects, it can be much less costly to customize a resistive touchpad than a capacitive touchpad. \u00a0 One of the most impressive benefits offered by resistive touchpads is their general hardiness. Not only do they admirably stand up to repeated use and general wear-and-tear, they can also withstand harsh environments, accidental contamination, and exposure to water. Sure, newer phones have capacitive interfaces that offer degrees of water resistance in case of an accidental dip. But the main problem faced by capacitive touchpads when exposed to liquid spills or submersions is a much more functional issue\u2014they simply won\u2019t work properly. Because water and many other liquids conduct electricity, spills on the surface of the pad can interfere with the electric field generated by the touchpad. These create numerous false detections and prevent the device from properly registering a user\u2019s intended inputs. So, if you are working outdoors in the rain, you\u2019ll find yourself struggling to wrangle the pad into performing as you expect. Resistive touchpads circumvent this problem with their very design. They can be installed in liquid resistant or waterproof integrations (for sustained exposure), and function normally. \u00a0 For many of the same reasons enumerated above, resistive touchpads can also stand up to exposure to dirt and grime without affecting their operation. Like liquids, these contaminants can also interfere with the capacitive device\u2019s electrical field, thus affecting performance. With a resistive touchpad, however, no matter what is clinging to the surface of the device, it will still register the pressure from a touch, which is the only requirement for operation. The fact that resistive touchpads can be integrated into water resistant applications also serves its dirt and grime resistance. If the device is contaminated with dust or oil, for example, it simply can be washed away with water or certain cleaners. It is certainly possible to integrate a capacitive touchpad into a contamination resistant assembly, but these housings typically have a negative impact on performance. \u00a0 As we have discussed, resistive touchpads are often used in rugged environments. And while a device like the VersaPad can stand up to these extreme conditions, their human operators sometimes need a little help from protective equipment\u2014gear that often includes gloves. Because capacitive touchpads depend on the conductivity of your finger to register contact, gloves can prevent these devices from detecting contact. Resistive touchpads can be operated no matter what type of gloves the user is wearing, because it is only dependent on the force of the touch. The latest VersaPad model, the VersaPad Plus, offers one of the largest surface areas of any touchpad on the market, which gives users greater control and precision while mousing. This next-gen model also offers multi-touch controls (traditionally unavailable on resistive touchpads), special scrolling zones, and a right-click zone. \u00a0 Now that we have established the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches, a picture of the best uses for resistive touchpads begins to emerge. Industrial, automotive, and in-the-field environments are all settings with high potential for devices to be exposed to contaminants\u2014everything from water and oil to dirt and dust. Medical equipment is also a great setting for VersaPad-based interfaces. During normal operation, these rugged devices might be exposed to spills, bodily fluids, or other liquids, so the pad\u2019s ability to function under these conditions is a must. Hospitals and other medical facilities also need to be sterile environments, which makes great use of the touchpad\u2019s easily cleanable surface. Military organizations require especially rugged equipment because they operate in a wide variety of theaters around the globe. Whatever the conditions they encounter, their gear needs to be able to stand up to whatever gets thrown at it\u2014including extreme temperatures, dirty conditions, and resistance to shocks and impacts. In the case of the VersaPad, the U.S. military has used the touchpad in their field laptops for many years, depending on its reliability and ruggedness under even the harshest conditions. \u00a0 No need to resist; we would be thrilled to speak with you about potential applications for the either standard or custom VersaPad or VersaPad Plus resistive touchpad sensors, modules or solutions!

Microsoft wants to help you write faster in Word with its text predictions feature. As you type, the application anticipates your next words and displays them for you to accept and move through your document quicker than ever. Here\u2019s how Text Predictions works. Like many new features in Microsoft Word, text predictions are enabled by default. But we\u2019ll show you how to confirm that the feature is turned on as well as how to turn it off if you prefer. In the status bar, which is at the bottom of the Microsoft Word window, you should see \u201cText Predictions\u201d near the center. It displays a status of either On or Off.  Click \u201cText Predictions\u201d in the status bar to open its setting directly in your Microsoft Word options. You can also navigate there with File > Options > Advanced. Under Editing Options, check the box for \u201cShow Text Predictions While Typing\u201d to enable the feature and click \u201cOK.\u201d  Use the same action to enable or disable text predictions in Word for the web. Click \u201cText Predictions\u201d in the status bar. Then, toggle on the \u201cSuggest Words or Phrases as I Type\u201d option to use the feature. Text predictions couldn\u2019t be simpler to use. As you type, you\u2019ll see dimmed suggested text display. This can be a single word or even a phrase. As you begin using the feature, you\u2019ll also see a Tab key indicator display next to the predictive text.  If you want to accept the suggestion, press either the Tab key or the right arrow key. The words will then fill in for you. If you do not want to use the predicted text, just keep typing the words you want. You can also hit Escape to ignore the suggestion. At the time of writing, text predictions are available in Word for Microsoft 365 and Word for the web. As with many new features, you may not see this one right away. Just keep checking back and look for that Text Predictions button in your status bar. If you believe that you should have the feature in the desktop version of Word on Windows but don\u2019t see the button, right-click the status bar. Then, look for \u201cText Predictions\u201d in the list. If you see it, make sure that it\u2019s checked so that it displays in your status bar. If it\u2019s not on the list, you\u2019ll need to wait a bit longer for its arrival.  Hopefully, the text predictions feature in Microsoft Word is something that you\u2019ll find useful.

This section of our website provides an introduction to these technologies, and highlights some of the features that contribute to an effective solution. A brief (90-second) video on natural language processing and text mining is also provided below. Widely used in knowledge-driven organizations, text mining is the process of examining large collections of documents to discover new information or help answer specific research questions. Text mining identifies facts, relationships and assertions that would otherwise remain buried in the mass of textual big data. Once extracted, this information is converted into a structured form that can be further analyzed, or presented directly using clustered HTML tables, mind maps, charts, etc. Text mining employs a variety of methodologies to process the text, one of the most important of these being Natural Language Processing (NLP). The structured data created by text mining can be integrated into databases, data warehouses or business intelligence dashboards and used for descriptive, prescriptive or predictive analytics. Natural Language Understanding helps machines \u201cread\u201d text (or another input such as speech) by simulating the human ability to understand a natural language such as English, Spanish or Chinese. Natural Language Processing includes both Natural Language Understanding and Natural Language Generation, which simulates the human ability to create natural language text e.g. to summarize information or take part in a dialogue. As a technology, natural language processing has come of age over the past ten years, with products such as Siri, Alexa and Google's voice search employing NLP to understand and respond to user requests. Sophisticated text mining applications have also been developed in fields as diverse as medical research, risk management, customer care, insurance (fraud detection) and contextual advertising. Today\u2019s natural language processing systems can analyze unlimited amounts of text-based data without fatigue and in a consistent, unbiased manner. They can understand concepts within complex contexts, and decipher ambiguities of language to extract key facts and relationships, or provide summaries. Given the huge quantity of unstructured data that is produced every day, from electronic health records (EHRs) to social media posts, this form of automation has become critical to analysing text-based data efficiently. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) technology which provides systems with the ability to automatically learn from experience without the need for explicit programming, and can help solve complex problems with accuracy that can rival or even sometimes surpass humans. However, machine learning requires well-curated input to train from, and this is typically not available from sources such as electronic health records (EHRs) or scientific literature where most of the data is unstructured text. When applied to EHRs, clinical trial records or full text literature, natural language processing can extract the clean, structured data needed to drive the advanced predictive models used in machine learning, thereby reducing the need for expensive, manual annotation of training data. In this 15-minute presentation, David Milward, CTO of Linguamatics, discusses AI\u00a0in general, AI technologies such as natural language processing and machine learning and how NLP and machine learning can be combined to create different learning systems. While traditional search engines like Google now offer refinements such as synonyms, auto-completion and semantic search (history and context), the vast majority of search results only point to the location of documents, leaving searchers with the problem of having to spend hours manually extracting the necessary data by reading through individual documents. The limitations of traditional search are compounded by the growth in big data over the past decade, which has helped increase the number of results returned for a single query by a search engine like Google from tens of thousands to hundreds of millions. The healthcare and biomedical sectors are no exception. A December 2018 study by the International Data Corporation (IDC) found that the volume of big data is projected to grow faster in healthcare than in manufacturing, financial services or media over the next seven years: experiencing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36%. IDC White Paper: The Digitization of the World from Edge to Core. With the growth of textual big data, the use of AI technologies such as natural language processing and machine learning becomes even more imperative. Ontologies, vocabularies and custom dictionaries are powerful tools to assist with search, data extraction and data integration. They are a key component of many text mining tools, and provide lists of key concepts, with names and synonyms often arranged in a hierarchy. Search engines, text analytics tools and natural language processing solutions become even more powerful when deployed with domain-specific ontologies. Ontologies enable the real meaning of the text to be understood, even when it is expressed in different ways (e.g. Tylenol vs. Acetaminophen). NLP techniques extend the power of ontologies, for example by allowing matching of terms with different spellings (Estrogen or Oestrogen), and by taking context into account (\u201cSCT\u201d can refer to the gene, \u201cSecretin\u201d, or to \u201cStair Climbing Test\u201d). The specification of an ontology includes a vocabulary of terms and formal constraints on its use. Enterprise-ready natural language processing requires range of vocabularies, ontologies and related strategies to identify concepts in their correct context: Linguamatics provides a number of standard terminologies, ontologies and vocabularies as part of its natural language processing platform. More information can be found on our Ontologies\u00a0page. The use of advanced analytics represents a real opportunity within the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, where the challenge lies in selecting the appropriate solution, and then implementing it efficiently across the enterprise. Effective natural language processing requires a number of features that should be incorporated into any enterprise-level NLP solution, and some of these are described below. There is huge variety in document composition and textual context, including sources, format, language and grammar. Tackling this variety requires a range of methodologies: An open architecture that allows for the integration of different components is now a crucial aspect in the development of enterprise systems, and there are a number of key standards in this area:- Partnerships are a critical enabler for industry innovators to access the tools and technologies needed to transform data across the enterprise.

So far I have come up with the following code:\nmain.pde: And TextBox.pde: For now let\u2019s focus on the typing aspect first. As you can experience, typing fast does not work as expected, if you type character by character it does work. How can I include this functionality of pressing multiple keys at the same time? I would like the code to be modular, so nothing in functions like mouseClicked() or mouseReleased() etc. If anyone can give me an example of how to use a library which has this functionality, that would be much appreciated as well. I don\u2019t have a lot of knowledge on how to import libraries. Thanks in advance,\nThomas example of how to use a library When you look at the library controlP5 or g4p they come with a lot of examples See section libraries on the website You can install them via the library installer They have good websites Eg http://www.lagers.org.uk/g4p/ As you can experience, typing fast does not work as expected, if you type character by character it does work. A fast typist will be hitting approximately 375 chars per minute, and Processing defaults to 60fps. However, no matter what its frameRate, Processing doesn\u2019t drop these events. Even at 1fps, it will catch dozens of keys correctly in each frame, in the correct order. Try it! Don\u2019t invoke key from inside draw() -> textBox1.draw() -> getUserInput() \u2013 that is a convenience keyword and will only give you a single event per frame. Call it from keyReleased(), which is invoked by every single queued event. Pass the unique key value each time. Thank you for the reply. Would it be possible to put the keyReleased() function inside a class? Thank you for your answer. I installed the G4P library via the Processing IDE and made the following script using the examples provided in the IDE, to get a textfield: However, when I try to set a new text in the textfield, I get a nullpointer exception. The setText() function does work as expected in the setup, but not in the draw. Does anyone know how I can solve this problem? println(txf1.getText()); Maybe that\u2019s the guilty line though? Unfortunately, running the above script without println(txf1.getText()); gives the same error: java.lang.NullPointerException\nat g4p_controls.GTextField.keyEvent(Unknown Source)\nat g4p_controls.GWindowImpl.sendKeyEvent(Unknown Source)\nat g4p_controls.GWindowImpl.keyEvent(Unknown Source)\nat sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor5.invoke(Unknown Source)\nat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\nat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\nat processing.core.PApplet$RegisteredMethods.handle(PApplet.java:1432)\nat processing.core.PApplet.handleMethods(PApplet.java:1634)\nNullPointerException\nat processing.core.PApplet.handleKeyEvent(PApplet.java:3014)\nat processing.core.PApplet.dequeueEvents(PApplet.java:2648)\nat processing.core.PApplet.handleDraw(PApplet.java:2486)\nat processing.awt.PSurfaceAWT$12.callDraw(PSurfaceAWT.java:1547)\nat processing.core.PSurfaceNone$AnimationThread.run(PSurfaceNone.java:313) yes, i see that too,\neven i try not to use your keyPressed  \u2026\nbut the G4P internal event handler\u2026\nstill. Looking at your sample code that uses GTextField there are a number of things worth mentioning but first of all the error is caused because you attempted to use setText(\"test2\"); while the textfield still had focus (the text insertion cursor is flashing). If you enter some text in the textfield  and then click outside the textfield before pressing ENTER then it works. NEVER use setText(...) while the textfield has focus, same thing applies to GPassword and GTextArea. All G4P control use event handlers to process events. Here is an example of how to use a textfield You will find more information about G4P on my website also look at the G4P Programmer Guides now thanks to that info you could overwrite the typed value?\nor ( as i not fully understand your use case )\ni try to empty it and give the user a new prompt text even something like Would it be possible to put the keyReleased() function inside a class? No in the sense that setup, draw, and event handlers are part of the Processing loop. Draw is called and then events are processed, then draw is called again. You can\u2019t put draw in a class, although you could choose to invoke redraw(). Your code puts event handlers in a class, but you then still need to pass the events from keyPressed() to the Objects of that class \u2013 for example, looping over an array in keyPressed and passing each event to each object. OR you could use registerMethod(\"keyEvent\") \u2013 for a previous discussion, see: https://forum.processing.org/two/discussion/25477/capturing-keyevent-in-own-class-registermethod That was indeed what I was trying to achieve.

But, telecoms use these terms incorrectly and may be misleading to many of their customers. There is actually a huge difference between 4G and 4G LTE. 4G means 4th generation, which refers to a complete new set of cellular technologies that surpass the capabilities of the older 3G technologies. But what telecoms are branding as 4G phones, including 4G LTE, do not really comply as 4G technologies as they do not pass the stated requirements. They still actually fall as 3G technologies since there are still no 4G technology being currently used. 4G LTE is actually a precursor to a more advanced cellular technology called LTE Advanced, which should be able to comply to 4G requirements. But when it comes to speed, 4G LTE has the advantage compared to what telecoms brand as 4G. 4G branded devices actually use HSPA+ technologies which can reach peak data rates of up to 21mbps, depending on the model. 4G LTE devices have a peak download rate of 75mbps, way more than what 4G devices are capable of. You should take note that you can only take advantage of the speed when you have a 4G LTE device connected to a 4G LTE network. If you can only get HSPA signal in your location, your device would automatically switch to that signal, thus nullifying any speed advantage. Before you splurge on a new 4G LTE device, you should inquire on whether your area is covered by LTE. This is important as many telecoms are still in the process of rolling out the new network. 4G and 4G LTE are just monikers used to indicate that the device may be able to browse the internet faster or download files quicker. But in actual use, the experience is still very much limited by the capabilities of the service provider and not by the device. Most companies do have speed limits or caps to prevent the abuse of their networks and to ensure smooth service for everyone. Just because you have a 4G LTE phone, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it will be much faster than a 4G phone. Summary:\n   Cite\nAPA 7\n\t, l.  (2018, February 6).

If you\u2019ve been down to your local Best Buy lately, you might have noticed that a whole new class of wireless routers are on the market\u00a0on the premium end of the product scale, emblazoned with an\u00a0\u201c802.11ac\u201d label in bright letters on the front of the box. But what does 802.11ac mean, and is it really necessary for you to get the most out of your daily WiFi browsing experience? Read on as we clear up the confusion around this confounding wireless networking standard and tell you everything you need to know about the newest devices that can support it in 2016. RELATED: Upgrade Your Wireless Router to Get Faster Speeds and More Reliable Wi-Fi Whenever you buy a new router, the first thing you probably notice is that no matter which model you eventually go with, they all share the denotation of \u201c802.11(something)\u201d somewhere in their name. Without getting too deep with the technical details, what you\u2019ll want to pay attention to is the letter that follows after this number, which signifies both the generation of the router and the maximum speed you can hope to transmit or receive between the base station and other wireless devices. You can read about what all of these mean in our handy guide here, but to cut to the chase the only two we\u2019ll be talking about today are 802.11n, and 802.11ac. To start, it helps to know that on the whole most routers made within the past five years will support 802.11n, which at its peak can transfer upwards of 450Mbits/s, or around 56 megabytes per second. This, of course, is the theoretical max point for the technology achieved in carefully controlled lab settings, but it\u2019s still plenty fast enough for the average household to run multiple Netflix streams or gaming sessions at a time without anyone noticing a slowdown.  802.11ac on the other hand is quite a bit newer, having only been approved by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) for consumers in 2014. Theoretically capable of maxing out at a whopping 1.3Gbits per second (162.5 MB/s), the throughput of an ac-enabled router is more than double what you can expect with the more common 802.11n. Also, it\u2019s important to note that\u00a0opposed to 802.11n, 802.11ac can only transmit over the 5Ghz spectrum. As we explain in this article, while the 2.4Ghz band is much more crowded than 5Ghz and can suffer from increased interference, its larger wavelength allows it to penetrate walls over longer distances without much signal loss. This means that if your router sits a number of rooms or floors away from your wireless devices, it may not be the best pick for your household despite the possible increased throughput. Because 802.11ac was only approved for the consumer market so recently, router manufacturers have just begun the process of flooding the shelves down at your local Best Buy with wireless networking hubs that bear the new brand. RELATED: HTG Reviews the D-Link AC3200 Ultra Wi-Fi Router: A Speedy Spaceship for Your Wi-Fi Needs To know that a router is ac-ready, simply look at the name of the model to learn everything you need to know about what kind of power you should expect straight out of the box. For the time being, all routers featuring 802.11ac will have an \u201cac\u201d stashed somewhere in its name\u00a0(the Asus\u00a0RT-AC3200, D-Link AC3200, etc). On average you can expect to pay anywhere from $150 \u2013 $400 for an 802.11ac router, which is a high price for users who might only have one or two devices in the house that are actually capable of tuning into the channel in the first place.  Right now, the crux of buying an 802.11ac router is that only the most current wireless devices even know how to decode its signal. For example, both the iPhone 6 and 6s are equipped to handle an 802.11ac signal\u2026but when was the last time you found yourself struggling with the fact that 802.11n\u00a0only\u00a0transmits at a \u2018mere\u2019 56 megabytes per second? 802.11ac will be great as soon as everyone in the house wants their own private 4K movie on laptops or streaming devices that are capable of handling that much bandwidth over the air, but until then, it seems it\u2019s simply\u00a0a luxury for those who have the hottest devices equipped with the latest and greatest in WiFi technology. So, do you really\u00a0need an 802.11ac\u00a0router just yet? (Probably) not. If you\u2019re somehow streaming 4K videos to your iPhone through a central media server or have an ultrabook that was released in the past six months then yes, you can receive an ac signal and obviously have enough reasons to put it to work. That said, unless you\u2019re one of the lucky few customers to have fiber optic lines in their home that actually receive broadband speeds above the 150Mbit limit, your standard b/g/n router should be able to handle the job just fine. They\u2019re a heck of a lot cheaper than 802.11ac routers, compatible with both the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz spectrum, and run almost all of the current heavy-load applications (gaming, streaming, downloading) without breaking a sweat. Our recommendation is to wait this one out another year or two once the rest of the wireless networking community catches up to the trend that 802.11ac routers are just starting to dip their toes into. If you have the spare cash on hand and just can\u2019t get enough of routers that look like they were designed by Bruce Wayne, then it\u2019s a worthy investment that\u2019s just about as \u201cfuture-proof\u201d as they come. If you just need something that delivers solid performance at a discount however, there are still plenty of 802.11n models out there that will get the job done just fine.

Microsoft Voice Recorder is a built-in app that comes preloaded on Windows 10 devices. It\u2019s designed to allow users to record voice memos, lectures, and interviews with ease. However, there is a limit to how long each recording can be. The maximum recording time for Microsoft Voice Recorder is three hours. This limit is in place to ensure that recordings don\u2019t take up too much space on the device and to make sure that files don\u2019t become too large to manage. While three hours may not seem like a lot, it\u2019s actually more than enough time to record a meeting or a lecture. If you need to record something longer, you can always break it up into several shorter recordings. Microsoft Voice Recorder is a handy app for quickly recording thoughts or ideas, and the time limit is a minor inconvenience compared to the benefits it provides. Windows 10 includes a number of features that make it an improvement on earlier versions of the operating system, including better audio recording capabilities.

In this article, we\u2019ve shown you how to change the recording settings in Windows 10 so that you can get the most out of the recorder. How long can I voice record? This is a question that is often asked by people who want to make voice recordings. The answer to this question depends on a number of factors, including the type of recording and the quality of the equipment that is used. In general, voice recordings can be made for a period of time that ranges from a few minutes to several hours. However, it is important to keep in mind that the quality of the recording may be impacted if it is made for a longer period of time. Additionally, it is important to make sure that the voice is well rested and that the vocal cords are healthy so that the best possible recording can be made. Editing audio recordings can be a helpful way to improve the quality of your recordings or to fix any mistakes that were made while recording. There are a number of software programs that can be used for audio editing, and the process of editing audio can vary depending on the program that is being used. In this article, we will provide an overview of how to edit an audio recording on a computer using the free audio editing program Audacity. First, open Audacity and import the audio recording that you would like to edit. To do this, click on the \"File\" menu and select \"Open.\" Navigate to the location of the audio file on your computer and click on \"Open.\" Once the audio file has been loaded into Audacity, you can begin to edit it. The first step is to select the portion of the audio that you would like to edit. To do this, use the Selection Tool (the cursor) to select the beginning and end of the desired segment. Once the beginning and end of the segment have been selected, click on the \"Cut\" button on the toolbar to cut the segment out of the audio file. Now that the segment has been cut out, you can insert it into another part of the audio file. To do this, click on the \"File\" menu and select \"Open.\" Navigate to the location of the audio file on your computer and click on \"Open.\" This will open the audio file in a new window. Now, use the Selection Tool to select the beginning and end of the segment that you want to insert into the other audio file. Once the beginning and end of the segment have been selected, click on the \"Insert\" button on the toolbar to insert the segment into the audio file. Once the desired segments have been edited, you can save the audio file by clicking on the \"File\" menu and selecting \"Save.\" There are a few different ways that you can change the recording time on your computer. One way is to use the Control Panel to change the settings. Another way is to use the Command Prompt. The third way is to use the Registry Editor. The first way to change the recording time is to use the Control Panel. To do this, open the Control Panel and click on the Sound icon. In the Sound window, click on the Recording tab. In the Recording tab, click on the Properties button. In the Properties window, click on the Advanced tab. In the Advanced tab, click on the Time button. In the Time window, use the slider to change the recording time. Click on the OK button to close the Windows. The second way to change the recording time is to use the Command Prompt. To do this, open the Command Prompt and type in the following command: timedate.set \"hh:mm:ss\" In the command, replace \"hh:mm:ss\" with the desired recording time. For example, if you want to record for 30 minutes, type in \"00:30:00\". Press the Enter key to execute the command. The third way to change the recording time is to use the Registry Editor. To do this, open the Registry Editor and navigate to the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\TimeZones In the TimeZones key, double-click on the StandardName value.

Whenever you buy a touchscreen, it isn't always advertised whether it's a capacitive or a resistive touchscreen. Yet, touchscreens of both types are used throughout the electronics industry. If you pay attention, you'll notice the difference between the two screens. In the case of capacitive touchscreens, such as on very expensive smartphones and tablets, are very responsive to the slightest touch. Meanwhile, resistive touchscreens may require more pressure, or the use of a stylus. The reason each type of touchscreen responds so differently is the underlying technology. The resistive touchscreen has always been the most common type used in industrial electronics. This is mostly because they're cheaper to make and are easier to use in difficult environments. The technology relies on resistance, meaning the pressure that's applied to the screen itself. This type of touchscreen is created out of two very thin layers of material, separated by a thin gap. The top layer is typically some type of clear poly-carbonate material, while the bottom layer is made up of a rigid material. Manufacturers typically use PET film and glass for these layers. The upper and bottom layers are lined with conducting material like indium tin oxide (ITO). The conducting sides of each layer face one another. Finally, spacers are placed in the thin gap between the two layers to prevent them from touching when the screen isn't in use. The diagram above is a simple guide showing how this technology works. When you press your finger or a stylus against the screen, it creates a change in resistance (an increase in voltage). The sensor layer then detects this change, and the tablet or mobile phone processor calculates the coordinates of that change. Resistive touchscreen technology relies on electrodes that layer a uniform voltage across the entire conductive area. This provides a specific voltage reading when an area of the two years make contact. The type of resistive layout determines the durability and sensitivity of the entire circuit. In a 4-wire analog setup, both the top and bottom layers contain two electrodes called \"bushbars\". These electrodes are oriented perpendicular to one another. Electrodes on the top sheet are the positive and negative Y axis, while electrodes on the bottom are the positive and negative X axis. Using this sort of electrical-coordinate setup, the mobile device can sense the coordinates where the two layers have come in contact. A 5-wire analog setup consists of four electrodes placed at each corner of the bottom layer. There are four wires that connect these electrodes together. The fifth wire is the \"sensing wire\" embedded into the top layer. When your finger or stylus makes any area of the two layers touch, the sensing wire sends the voltage for the coordinates to the processor. With fewer components and a simpler design, the 5-wire analog circuit is considered to be a bit more durable than other designs. The most sensitive resistive screen design is that of the 8-wire sensing circuit. The layout is similar to the 4-wire analog, but each of the bar electrodes contain two wires. This introduces a bit of redundancy into the circuit. This is because even if one of the wire pairs loses resistance over time, the second wire provides a secondary signal to the processor. This means that a more expensive resistive touchscreen with an 8-wire analog circuit will last longer. It also avoids the \"drift\" problems older phones used to have when trying to sense the location of your finger or stylus. Resistive touchscreens are meant to sense the location of one touch, and early generation touchscreens couldn't respond to two-finger pinch or zoom actions. However, later generations saw some mobile device manufacturers introducing new algorithms and other tricks that allowed for two-finger touch features. Some other limitations include: In most cases such touchscreens are difficult or impossible to repair. Capacitive touchscreens were actually invented almost 10 years before the first resistive touchscreen. Nevertheless, today's capacitive touchscreens are highly accurate and respond instantly when lightly touched by a human finger. So how does it work? As opposed to the resistive touchscreen, which relies on the mechanical pressure made by the finger or stylus, the capacitive touchscreen makes use of the fact that the human body is naturally conductive. Capacitive screens are made of a transparent, conductive material---usually ITO---coated onto a glass material. It's the glass material that you touch with your finger. In a surface capacitive setup, there are four electrodes placed at each corner of the touchscreen, which maintain a level voltage over the entire conductive layer. When your conductive finger comes in contact with any part of the screen, it initiates current flow between those electrodes and your finger. Sensors positioned under the screen sense the change in voltage, and the location of that change. In a device that uses a projected capacitive setup, transparent electrodes are placed along the protective glass coating in a matrix formation. One line of electrodes (vertical) maintain a constant level of current when the screen isn't in use. Another line (horizontal) are triggered when your finger touches the screen and initiates current flow in that area of the screen. The matrix formation creates an electrostatic field where the two lines intersect. This is one of the most sensitive types of touchscreens, and is\u00a0how some phones can sense a finger touch even before you make contact with the screen itself. Projected capacitive technology also allows you to use the touchscreen even when you're wearing thin gloves. Resistive touchscreen advantages include: Capacitive touchscreen advantages include: The choice to use a capacitive or resistive touchscreen depends largely on the application for the device. Most devices with resistive screens are used in manufacturing, ATMs and kiosks, and medical devices. This is because in most industries the users need to wear gloves when using the touchscreens. Capacitive screens are typically used in most consumer products like tablets, laptops, and smartphones. If it weren't for cutting edge touchscreen technologies, we could never enjoy cool new applications like Opera's one-handed browsing for Android. The applications are only going to expand as the technology continues to be refined. Ryan has a BSc degree in Electrical Engineering.

The quality of digital sound is determined by discrete  parameters and by compression parameters. Discrete parameters are the sample  rate, bit capacity, and the number of channels. Compression parameters are the  compression format being used and the bit rate. General recommendations for selecting a recording format  Sometimes the  recording format is determined based on how the target file will be used. Also, it is not feasible to choose a target sound format with a higher quality than the source sound format. This only leads to an increase in the size of the target file. In other cases, the optimal recording format depends upon  the type of recording (e.g. speech, music, etc.) and your own tastes and  preferences. Below are some recommendations that you can consider when  selecting an optimal format for your recording. Considerations for how a target file will be used To create an audio CD, usually you need CD-quality wav files (i.e. PCM 44.1KHz 16bit Stereo).  If your CD player supports any compressed formats \r\n              (WMA, MP3 etc.) or you plan to transfer recorded files to a mobile \r\n              phone or any other portable device, you need to note that these \r\n              devices often have special requirements for the format of recorded \r\n              audio. In this case, you  need to refer to their documentation. Considerations  based on the audio source If you record from some external device (including \r\n              microphone, CD or LP player) you need to use Sound Board \r\n              recording mode. When recording from digital input lines, you need to match  the recording format (sample rate) with the format of the sound source.  Sometimes you will need an exact match of the source sample rate and recording  sample rate. To determine the required sample frequency, use menu Options -> Settings, General, Audio device information. It is not recommended that you use stereo recording \r\n              format when recording from mono sources (e.g. microphone).  If you record output from other software (such as Windows \r\n              Media Player, RealPlayer, or Internet player), you need to take \r\n              into account the format of the source audio when selecting the optimal \r\n              recording format. This requires that you know whether the sound \r\n              is being reproduced in a compressed or an uncompressed format.  If you plan to record sound that is already compressed (for example, many Internet transmissions are broadcast in MP3 or WMA format) then it is recommended that you record in the same format as the sound is being reproduced with. If you are concerned about file size, you can select a sound format with a lower quality.  If you plan to record uncompressed sound (e.g. from an audio CD) then you can either record without conversion (if you want to preserve maximum quality) or compress it (if you want to reduce the file size). You can use either lossy or lossless compression.  If the format of the  sound source has a higher quality than CD (e.g. DVD audio), you may want to record it in one of the high quality formats which are available only in the Professional, Video Pro and Developer Editions. In Software mode, we recommend that you \r\n              record without conversion, and then save the recording using various \r\n              target formats. After listening to the recorded file, you can determine \r\n              the desired sound format. After that, record from the same source \r\n              and convert it to the determined sound format on \r\n              the fly. This term means that audio is being immediately reconverted into another format as it is being recorded in Software mode. To turn \"on the fly\" conversion on/off: click the Recording source and parameters button, click the Change...  button in the Recording format  group and select or clear the Convert audio format to the one specified below   check box: \n\n As previously noted, no conversion can increase the actual sound quality. If a player reproduces \"8000 Hz 8 bit mono\" sound, and you convert it to \"44100 Hz 16 bit stereo\", it will not sound any better than \"8000 Hz 8 bit mono\". In fact, it may sound even worse than the original. If you want to record in a specific sound format, use \"on the fly\" conversion and explicitly indicate the desired format. For example, if you want to put your recording onto an audio CD, you need to select \"CD quality\" (PCM 44100 Hz 16 bit stereo). If you want to create a file with an acceptable sound quality but minimize its size, you can try to record without conversion, and then save the recording using a different target format. After listening to the recorded file, you can determine the desired sound format. Record from the same source and convert it to the determined sound format. It is not feasible to increase the sample frequency or to make a stereo recording out of a mono recording. Also, it is not recommended you change the sample frequency. If you need to use a lower sample frequency to create a smaller file, we recommend reducing the frequency by 2 or 4 times. This will minimize the loss of quality. Example. A file was created from a recording without format conversion and its format is \"PCM 24000 Hz 16 bit mono\". The recommended \"Save As...\" formats for this file and optimal recording formats for similar files are: It is not recommended you use the following formats: One very important case where you should not use \"on the fly\" MP3 conversion is when burning CDs. Some software (e.g. Music Match) lets you burn CDs directly from MP3 files. However, it is not feasible to convert from another format to MP3 and then put it to CD because you can lose quality. Instead, you should convert it to PCM 44100 Hz 16 bit stereo. Considerations  based on the audio characteristics of the data being recorded Another important factor that you need to consider when selecting a recording format are the characteristics of the audio that you plan to record. In general, music requires higher quality formats than speech recordings.  For quality recording of music, you should use a  sample rate of 44100 Hz or higher. For speech recordings of dictaphone quality, it is possible to use 11025 Hz. For quality speech recordings or middle-quality recordings of music, you can use a sample rate of 22050 Hz.  If you record an uncompressed sound, you also need to select a bit capacity. For quality recording, a bit capacity would  be 16 bit. It is recommended that you use 8-bit format  only for speech recordings of dictaphone quality since they have a small  dynamic range and a high noise level. The number of channels (e.g. mono or  stereo) depends upon the sound source. If you plan to record in a compressed format, you can compress speech recordings to a greater degree without losing quality compared with music recordings. For music recordings, only a 5-10 degree compression is recommended. Also, it is recommended that for compression of speech, you use a compression format designed specifically for speech (e.g. DSP TrueSpeech) rather than for music (e.g. MP3).  If you record from a source that reproduces high-quality sound (e.g. with a professional sound card), you may consider using a high-quality format to preserve the quality of the original sound. You can use the following table to select the target sound format based on characteristics of sound source. High quality formats Starting with version 5.2, Total Recorder Professional Edition supports high-quality formats. This includes high-quality PCM formats (up to 192kHz 24bit and float mono and stereo), high-quality FLAC formats (up to 192kHz 24bit mono and stereo), high-quality Windows Media Audio Lossless stereo formats (up to 96kHz 24bit), and the stereo formats of the Windows Media Audio Professional codec. Lossless compression A lossless codec compresses sound data which results in a smaller sound file that has exactly the same quality as the original file. Normally, a sound file compressed by a lossless codec has a larger size than that compressed by a non-lossless codec.\r\n\t  Lossless codecs differ in the speed and degree of compression and in the sound formats they support. You can use Total Recorder for lossless compression by encoding to Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless format  or to FLAC format. Note that it doesn't make sense to apply lossless compression to a file which was encoded using a non-lossless codec. This will most likely result in only a larger sound file.

Why do so many audio file formats exist and is there a best audio format? Audio files come in all types and sizes. And while we may all be familiar with MP3, what about AAC, FLAC, OGG, or WMA? Why do so many audio file extensions exist? Is there a universal best audio file format? Which ones are important, and which ones can you ignore? It's quite simple once you realize that all audio formats fall into three major categories. Once you know what the categories mean, you can pick a format within the category that best suits your needs. Uncompressed audio consists of real sound waves captured and converted to digital format without further processing. As a result, uncompressed audio files tend to be the most accurate but take up a LOT of disk space\u2014about 34 MB per minute for 24-bit 96KHz stereo. PCM stands for Pulse-Code Modulation, a digital representation of raw analog audio signals. Analog sounds exist as waveforms. To convert a waveform into digital bits, the sound must be sampled and recorded at certain intervals (or pulses). This digital audio format has a \"sampling rate\" (how often a sample is made) and a \"bit depth\" (how many bits are used to represent each sample). There is no compression involved. Digital recording is a close-to-exact representation of analog sound. PCM is the most common audio format used in CDs and DVDs. There is a subtype of PCM called Linear Pulse-Code Modulation, where samples are taken at linear intervals. LPCM is the most common form of PCM, which is why the two terms are almost interchangeable at this point. WAV stands for Waveform Audio File Format (also called Audio for Windows at some point but not anymore). It's a standard that was developed by Microsoft and IBM back in 1991. Many assume that all WAV files are uncompressed audio files, but that's not true. WAV is a Windows container for different music formats. This means that a WAV file could potentially contain compressed audio, but it's rarely used for that. Most WAV files contain uncompressed audio in PCM format. The WAV file is just a wrapper for the PCM encoding, making it more suitable for use on Windows systems. However, Mac systems can usually open WAV files without any issues. AIFF stands for Audio Interchange File Format. Similar to how Microsoft and IBM developed WAV for Windows, AIFF is an audio file format developed by Apple for Mac systems back in 1988. Another audio format similar to WAV files, AIFF files can contain multiple kinds of audio formats. For example, there is a compressed version called AIFF-C and another version called Apple Loops used by GarageBand and Logic Pro. They both use the same AIFF extension. Most AIFF files contain uncompressed audio in PCM format. The AIFF file is just a wrapper for the PCM encoding, making it more suitable for use on Mac systems. However, Windows systems can usually open AIFF files without any issues. Lossy compression is when some data is lost during the compression process\u2014and compression is important because uncompressed audio takes up lots of disk space. In other words, lossy compression means sacrificing sound quality and audio fidelity for smaller file sizes. You'll hear artifacts and other weirdnesses in the audio when it's done poorly. But when it's done well, you can't hear the difference. MP3 stands for MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3. It was released back in 1993 and exploded in popularity, eventually becoming the most popular audio format in the world for music files. There's a reason we had \"MP3 players\" but not \"OGG players!\" The main goal of MP3 is three-fold: Nearly every digital device in the world with audio playback can read and play MP3 files, whether we're talking PCs, Macs, Androids, iPhones, Smart TVs, or whatever else. When you need universal, MP3 will never let you down, which is why it's one of the world's most popular audio file formats. Note: MP3 is not the same as MP4! The difference between the audio file extensions is simple: MP3 covers audio only, while MP4 includes audio and video. So, an MP3 player only supports audio, but an MP4 player can play audio and video media types. AAC stands for Advanced Audio Coding. It was developed in 1997 as the successor to MP3; while it did catch on as a popular digital audio format, it never really overtook MP3 as the most popular. The compression algorithm used by AAC is much more advanced and technical than the MP3 music file type, so when you compare the same recording in MP3 and AAC formats at the same bitrate, the AAC one will generally have better sound quality. Even though MP3 is more of a household format, AAC is still widely used today. In fact, it's the standard audio compression method used by YouTube, Android, iOS, iTunes, later Nintendo portables, and later PlayStations. OGG doesn't stand for anything. Actually, it's not even a compression format. Instead, OGG is a multimedia container that can hold all kinds of compression formats but is most commonly used to hold Vorbis files\u2014which is why these audio file types are called Ogg Vorbis files. Vorbis was first released in 2000 and grew in popularity for two reasons: It adheres to the principles of open-source software and performs significantly better than most other lossy compression formats (meaning it produces a smaller file size for equivalent audio quality). MP3 and AAC have such strong footholds that OGG has had a hard time breaking into the spotlight\u2014not many devices support it natively\u2014but it's getting better with time. For now, it's mostly used by hardcore proponents of open-source software. WMA stands for Windows Media Audio. It was first released in 1999 and has undergone several evolutions since then, all while keeping the same WMA name and extension. It's a proprietary format created by Microsoft. Not unlike AAC and OGG, WMA was meant to address some flaws in the MP3 compression method\u2014and it turns out that WMA's approach to compression is pretty similar to those of AAC and OGG. So yes, in terms of objective compression quality, WMA is actually the better audio file type than MP3. But since WMA is proprietary, not many devices and platforms support it. It also doesn't offer any real benefits over AAC or OGG, so when MP3 isn't good enough, it's simply more practical to go with one of those two instead of WMA. Opposite lossy compression is lossless compression, a method that reduces an audio file's size without ANY data loss between the source and the compressed audio files. The downside is that lossless compressed audio files are bigger than lossy compressed audio files\u2014up to 2x to 5x larger for the same source file. FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Maybe it is a bit on the nose, but it has quickly become one of the most popular lossless formats available since its introduction in 2001. What's nice is that FLAC can compress an original source file by up to 60 percent without losing a single bit of data. What's even nicer is that FLAC is an open-source and royalty-free audio file format, so it doesn't impose any intellectual property constraints. FLAC is supported by most major programs and devices and is the main alternative to MP3 for music. With it, you get the full quality of raw uncompressed audio at half the file size. That's why many see FLAC as the best audio format. ALAC stands for Apple Lossless Audio Codec. It was developed and launched in 2004 as a proprietary format but eventually became open-source and royalty-free in 2011. ALAC is sometimes referred to as Apple Lossless. While ALAC is good, it's slightly less efficient than FLAC regarding compression. However, Apple users don't have a choice between the two because iTunes and iOS both provide native support for ALAC and no support for FLAC. Looking for help playing hi-res audio on your iPhone or iPad? Check out our guide. WMA stands for Windows Media Audio. We covered this above in the lossy compression section, but we mention it here because there's a lossless alternative called WMA Lossless that uses the same extension. Confusing, I know. Compared to FLAC and ALAC, WMA Lossless is the worst in terms of compression efficiency\u2014but not by much. It's a proprietary format, so it's no good for fans of open-source software, but it's supported natively on both Windows and Mac systems. The biggest issue with WMA Lossless is the limited hardware support. If you want to play lossless compressed audio across multiple devices and platforms, you should stick with FLAC. For most people, the decision is pretty easy: For those who want the utmost quality in their music playback, note that high-quality audio files won't matter if your playback device can't faithfully recreate those sounds.

The available bandwidths are also flexible starting with 1.4 MHz up to 20 MHz with Carrier Aggregation allowing use of wider multiples. LTE is developed to support both the time division duplex technology (TDD) as well as frequency division duplex (FDD). Availability of specific bands varies per country and operator.  4G LTE Frequency Bands There are\u00a0a growing number of LTE frequency bands that are being designated as possibilities for use with LTE. Many of the LTE frequency bands are already in use for other cellular systems, whereas other LTE bands are new and being introduced as other users are re-allocated spectrum elsewhere. FDD spectrum requires pair bands, one of the uplink and one for the downlink, and TDD requires a single band as uplink and downlink are on the same frequency but time separated. As a result, there are different LTE band allocations for TDD and FDD. In some cases these bands may overlap, and it is therefore feasible, although unlikely that both TDD and FDD transmissions could be present on a particular LTE frequency band. The greater likelihood is that a single UE or mobile will need to detect whether a TDD or FDD transmission should be made on a given band. UEs that roam may encounter both types on the same band. They will therefore need to detect what type of transmission is being made on that particular LTE band in its current location. The different LTE frequency allocations or LTE frequency bands are allocated numbers. Currently the LTE bands between 1 & 22 are for paired spectrum, i.e. FDD, and LTE bands between 33 & 41 are for unpaired spectrum, i.e. TDD.  LTE frequency band There is a large number of allocations or radio spectrum that has been reserved for FDD, frequency division duplex, LTE use. The FDD LTE frequency bands are paired to allow simultaneous transmission on two frequencies. The bands also have a sufficient separation to enable the transmitted signals not to unduly impair the receiver performance. If the signals are too close then the receiver may be \u201cblocked\u201d and the sensitivity impaired. The separation must be sufficient to enable the roll-off of the antenna filtering to give sufficient attenuation of the transmitted signal within the receive band. \u00a0FDD LTE is popular for traditional cellular operators who already have established 2G and 3G services, where spectrum is traditionally \u201cpaired\u201d as FDD. With the interest in TDD LTE, there are several unpaired frequency allocations that are being prepared for LTE TDD use. The TDD LTE bands are unpaired because the uplink and downlink share the same frequency, being time multiplexed. \u00a0TDD LTE is popular in ISP and closed networks where there\u00a0is either predominantly Data-centric use (rather than voice), no legacy of 2G/3G, or pressure on limited spectrum available. From Tables 5.5-1 \u201cE-UTRA Operating Bands\u201d and 5.6.1-1 \u201cE-UTRA Channel Bandwidth\u201d of 3GPP TS 36.101,[1]\u00a0the following table lists the specified frequency bands of\u00a0LTE\u00a0and the channel bandwidths each band supports. Superseded bands are indicated by a grey background. There are regular additions to the LTE frequency bands / LTE spectrum allocations as a result of negotiations at the ITU regulatory meetings. These LTE allocations are resulting in part from the digital dividend, and also from the pressure caused by the ever growing need for mobile communications. Many of the new LTE spectrum allocations are relatively small, often 10 \u2013 20MHz in bandwidth, and this is a cause for concern. With LTE-Advanced using channel aggregation to use bandwidths of 100 MHz, channel aggregation over a wide set of frequencies many be needed, availability of sufficient spectrum\u00a0has been recognised as a significant technological problem. There are many different bands that are being allocated for use with LTE. These bands are defined on the previous page. On this page, additional notes and information are given about these different LTE bands. The number of bands allocated for use has increased as the pressure increases on spectrum. It has not been possible for all LTE band allocations to be the same across the globe because of the different regulatory positions in different countries. It has not been possible to gain global allocations. In some cases bands appear to overlap. This is because of the different levels of availability around the globe. This means that roaming with LTE may have some limitations as not all handsets or UEs will be able to access the same frequencies. There are a few notes that can give some background to the LTE bands defined in the table on the previous page.  Summary of\u00a0LTE Bands and Spectrum  4G/LTE Frequency Bands and Spectrum Although 3GPP can defined bands for use in LTE or any other mobile service, the actual allocations are made on an international basis by the ITU are World radio Conferences, and then the individual country administrations can allocate spectrum use in their own countries. 3GPP has no legal basis, and can only work with the various country administrations. Frequency bands may be allocated on a primary and secondary basis. Primary users have the first access to a band, secondary users, in general, may use the band provided they do not cause interference to the primary users.

But today, we would like to focus the spotlight on another one of our core offerings-the VersaPad line of resistive touchpads (also called trackpads). Capitalizing on our expertise in force detection, Interlink's first VersaPad model, released in the mid-1990s, distinguished itself from the rest of the touchpad pack by using pressure detection to register inputs. In the years since, we have released multiple iterations of the VersaPad-consistently adding new features and improving performance-culminating with last year's introduction of the VersaPad Plus. However, while the technology has evolved, the most fundamental advantages of resistive technology haven't changed.\n     \n      In this post, we will explain how resistive touchpads work, as well as their benefits and disadvantages when compared with their main alternative, capacitive touchpads.\n     \nHow Does a Resistive Touchpad Work?\n \n      Resistive touchpads detect pressure exerted by the user on the device, either with their fingers or some intermediary like a stylus, to interpret position and movement-providing functionality similar to that of a traditional mouse. The device's basic construction consists of two ultrathin resistive plates precisely positioned with a small separation between them. Each resistive plate is coated with one half of the circuit using proprietary functional materials. When pressure is applied to the surface of the VersaPad, the top layer deflects at the point of contact, causing the two plates to make contact and current to flow between the two halves of the circuit. Each of the two plates has an important job to do, with one registering the position of the press on the y-axis and the other tracking the x-axis. Amalgamating this feedback tells the system exactly where and how much force is being applied at any given time. This information can then be used as inputs for mousing and other human machine interface (HMI) applications.\n     \n      These devices are often put into laptops, used as standalone interfaces, or integrated into larger HMIs. However, the device's software can also be configured for applications beyond mousing, such as using it for joystick functionality or as a multifunction button. Resistive touchpads are extremely rugged, withstanding the effects of extreme temperatures, shocks, vibrations, contamination, and electromagnetic (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI)-the latter two of which can be a major issue for capacitive sensing technology (our next subject of discussion) if not properly shielded.\n     \nHow Does a Capacitive Touchpad Work?\n \n      Capacitive touchpads detect contact by creating an electrostatic field along a conductive surface. When an object that has dielectric properties or conducts electricity-like the skin on your finger-interferes with this field through touch (or even just gets near enough to affect it), it reduces the system's capacitance at that point. The system then determines where this disturbance occurs along the pad's X and Y axes, which is translated into input data. This is the fundamental idea behind both surface and projected capacitive sensor-though their construction, operation, and advantages vary somewhat.\n     \n      Capacitive touchpads are the chief alternative to resistive touchpads, and of the two, it is likely the technology that everyday consumers interact with the most-personal laptop touchpads are usually capacitive, as are most smartphone screens. They are chosen for these applications because they generally feature higher input resolutions than resistive touchpads and don't require the user to keep pressure on the screen, giving them a bit more of an intuitive feel. There was also a time when capacitive technology offered features that could not be replicated on resistive touchpads-such as multi-touch controls-although advancements in technology have closed the gap on many of these advantages.\n     \n      Beyond features and capabilities, another factor to consider is customizability and cost. If your application requires a solution with special dimensions, integration requirements, or interconnects, it can be much less costly to customize a resistive touchpad than a capacitive touchpad.\n     \nWater, Chemical, and Liquid Resistance\n \n      One of the most impressive benefits offered by resistive touchpads is their general hardiness. Not only do they admirably stand up to repeated use and general wear-and-tear, they can also withstand harsh environments, accidental contamination, and exposure to water. Sure, newer phones have capacitive interfaces that offer degrees of water resistance in case of an accidental dip. But the main problem faced by capacitive touchpads when exposed to liquid spills or submersions is a much more functional issue-they simply won't work properly. Because water and many other liquids conduct electricity, spills on the surface of the pad can interfere with the electric field generated by the touchpad. These create numerous false detections and prevent the device from properly registering a user's intended inputs. So, if you are working outdoors in the rain, you'll find yourself struggling to wrangle the pad into performing as you expect.\n     \n      Resistive touchpads circumvent this problem with their very design. They can be installed in liquid resistant or waterproof integrations (for sustained exposure), and function normally.\n     \nDirt and Grime Resistance\n \n      For many of the same reasons enumerated above, resistive touchpads can also stand up to exposure to dirt and grime without affecting their operation. Like liquids, these contaminants can also interfere with the capacitive device's electrical field, thus affecting performance. With a resistive touchpad, however, no matter what is clinging to the surface of the device, it will still register the pressure from a touch, which is the only requirement for operation.\n     \n      The fact that resistive touchpads can be integrated into water resistant applications also serves its dirt and grime resistance. If the device is contaminated with dust or oil, for example, it simply can be washed away with water or certain cleaners. It is certainly possible to integrate a capacitive touchpad into a contamination resistant assembly, but these housings typically have a negative impact on performance.\n     \nOperational Versatility\n \n      As we have discussed, resistive touchpads are often used in rugged environments. And while a device like the VersaPad can stand up to these extreme conditions, their human operators sometimes need a little help from protective equipment-gear that often includes gloves. Because capacitive touchpads depend on the conductivity of your finger to register contact, gloves can prevent these devices from detecting contact. Resistive touchpads can be operated no matter what type of gloves the user is wearing, because it is only dependent on the force of the touch.\n     \n      The latest VersaPad model, the VersaPad Plus, offers one of the largest surface areas of any touchpad on the market, which gives users greater control and precision while mousing. This next-gen model also offers multi-touch controls (traditionally unavailable on resistive touchpads), special scrolling zones, and a right-click zone.\n     \nKey Industries\n \n      Now that we have established the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches, a picture of the best uses for resistive touchpads begins to emerge. Industrial, automotive, and in-the-field environments are all settings with high potential for devices to be exposed to contaminants-everything from water and oil to dirt and dust. Medical equipment is also a great setting for VersaPad-based interfaces. During normal operation, these rugged devices might be exposed to spills, bodily fluids, or other liquids, so the pad's ability to function under these conditions is a must. Hospitals and other medical facilities also need to be sterile environments, which makes great use of the touchpad's easily cleanable surface.\n     \n      Military organizations require especially rugged equipment because they operate in a wide variety of theaters around the globe. Whatever the conditions they encounter, their gear needs to be able to stand up to whatever gets thrown at it-including extreme temperatures, dirty conditions, and resistance to shocks and impacts. In the case of the VersaPad, the U.S. military has used the touchpad in their field laptops for many years, depending on its reliability and ruggedness under even the harshest conditions.\n     \nTaking the Next Steps\n \n      No need to resist; we would be thrilled to speak with you about potential applications for the either standard or custom VersaPad or VersaPad Plus resistive touchpad sensors, modules or solutions!

Vorbis, Theora and Ogg will be supported natively by built-in and third-party apps. Windows 10 has already got support for FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) with its initial release. Developers have decided to support more free formats. The OGG media container, Vorbis audio codec, and the Theora video codec will be available to all installed apps. This information came from the Microsoft Edge platform development status page. It indicates that support for the OGG Container, Vorbis Audio Codec, and Theora Video Codec is coming to the whole Windows 10 device family, including PCs, Mixed Reality, Xbox, and Mobile. The exact release date for this feature is not specified yet, but we can guess that it will be implemented in Windows 10 Redstone 4.  Windows 10 is getting support for Vorbis for a reason. As you may already know, the company has discontinued their Groove Music Pass subscription service and is going to transfer all the subscribers to Spotify instead. Spotify is actively using the OGG/Vorbis codec in their streaming service and in the desktop app. Having native Vorbis support in Windows 10 will allow Microsoft and third party developers to implement a number of UWP (Store) apps for use with the Spotify service and make the Microsoft Store platform more attractive for developers and users. This can be one of the reasons for the upcoming change. So, what do you think about this change? Do you use these media formats? Are you happy with these new formats being added or do you not care?

The reason there are 1024 bytes in a kilobyte, and 1024 Kb in a Megabyte, and 1024 Mb in a Gigabyte, is because long ago when they first invented computers and they needed a way to address each byte in memory, they used 12 bits 1111 1111 1111 to hold the address number of each byte in memory. So 000000000001 is byte 1, and 111111111111 is byte 1024. To only use 1000 bytes would have been wasteful of the addressing capability, and in those days every byte counted.Now when we work with Gigs it is not usually so important to notice that there are some extra Megs over the 1000Mb count. Who cares, most of the time. But you must understand that even if you only count in 1000s, and not in 1024s, the extra ones are still there.So for example if you wanted to map 16G of memory to disk, and you had to size the disk file in M, if you sized it as 16,000M, and then copied the memory to the disk file, you would fail. Because the memory is actually 16384 Mb long.But usually we are working with rough amounts of space, not exact, so it doesn't matter. ...

Thus, the sensed values generated from different positions along a sensing line are equalized, and the touch positioning accuracy of the capacitive touchpad is improved. The present invention is related generally to a capacitive touchpad and, more particularly, to an equalized capacitive touchpad and a touch positioning method for a capacitive touchpad. Traditionally, the touch sensor of a capacitive touchpad is realized by a printed circuit board (PCB). However, the opaqueness of the PCB restricts applications of the capacitive touchpad in cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), multi-media display panels and other electronic products. Transparent electrically conductive films, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) and indium zinc oxide (IZO), can be used to replace the PCB traces for transparent applications. Alternatively, a transparent membrane printed with conductive carbon paste or silver ink trances may implement applications of a capacitive touchpad for electronic products where the touchpad is intended to reveal through a bottom side thereof. However, unlike the PCB trace whose impedance is so low as to be negligible, the trace made of ITO, IZO, conductive carbon paste, silver ink or the like exhibit a significant impedance, which will result in errors in sensed values of the touch sensor and disadvantageously affect touch positioning by the capacitive touchpad. As shown in FIG. 1, a capacitive touchpad 100 includes a touch sensor 110 and a controller 120. The touch sensor 110 shown therein is a two-dimensional one, which has sensing lines arranged in two directions, namely the group of X1, X2, . . . , Xm, XM and the group of Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn, . . . , YN. Typically, the two directions of the sensing lines are referred to as X direction and Y direction for convenience's sake. If the touch sensor 110 is realized by a PCB, the sensing lines X1, X2, . . . , Xm, . . . , XM and Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn, . . . , YN are copper traces on the PCB. If, for transparent applications, ITO or IZO is used to make the sensing lines X1, X2, . . . , Xm, . . . , XM and Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn, . . . , YN, then the substrate for the sensing lines can be made of glass, plastic or other transparent materials. If the sensing lines X1, X2, . . . , Xm, . . . , XM and Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn, . . . , YN are conductive carbon paste or silver ink, the substrate is a transparent membrane. The controller 120 is a semiconductor chip installed on a flexible printed circuit board (FPC) 115, and is connected to the sensing lines X1, X2, . . . , Xm, . . . , XM and Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn, . . . , YN by metal wires 125 printed on the FPC 115. The controller 120 has a detector circuit therein, to detect the capacitance variations along the sensing lines X1, X2, . . . , Xm, . . . , XM and Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn, . . . , YN. The detected capacitance variation is referred to as a sensed value, from which a position of an object touched on the touch sensor 110 can be determined. In further detail, as shown in FIG. 2, a sensing line has many capacitive sensor pads 130 to 148 thereon. If this sensing line has an impedance so low as to be negligible, the sensed values generated by an object touch on anywhere of the sensor pads 130 to 148 are substantially equal, and allow the controller 120 to precisely determine, according to preset reference values, whether or not an object touch has been made. On the contrary, if the electric resistance of this sensing line is too large to be ignored, the sensing line of FIG. 2 will have an equivalent circuit as shown in FIG. 3, which will produce a resistor-capacitor (RC) filtering effect on the sensed values generated therefrom. As a result, referring to FIG. 4, when an object touches the sensing line at different sensor pads 130 to 148, the sensed values detected by the controller 120 will be different from each other and are attenuated with the distance between the controller 120 and the touched sensor pads 130 to 148. Consequently, there is a great difference between the sensed value corresponding to the nearest sensor pad 130, which is adjacent to the controller 120, and the sensed value corresponding to the farthest sensor pad 148, which is away from the controller 120. The attenuation of the sensed values due to actual impedance makes it difficult to make adjustments to the capacitive touchpad, or even impossible to detect a capacitance variation if a thicker medium is used in the touchpad. Moreover, even if an object touches a same sensing line, the sensed values corresponding to different sensor pads may be so significantly varied as to increase the chances of error actions resulted from misjudgments by the controller. The problem resulted from the attenuation of the sensed values due to the impedance of a sensing line itself can be minimized by arranging all the sensing lines of a capacitive touchpad in an interleaving manner so as to homogenize the resistance/capacitance distribution of the sensing lines. However, for interleaving sensing lines arrangement, the sensing lines in X and Y directions are drawn to the controller from two opposite ends thereof and result in a rather complicated wiring layout. Moreover, as shown in FIG. 5, if a touch sensor 210 has a rectangular shape, and the sensing lines in X and Y directions are drawn to a controller 220 from two opposite ends thereof, the excessively long sensing lines 230 to 234 not only increase the difficulty in wiring layout, but also produce additional parasitic resistances, which will further increase the difficulty in signal processing as well. An object of the present invention is to provide an equalized capacitive touchpad and a touch positioning method for a capacitive touchpad. Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for simplifying the wiring layout of a capacitive touchpad. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for improving the touch positioning accuracy of a capacitive touchpad. According to the present invention, an equalized capacitive touchpad and a touch positioning method use an equalizer to correct a sensed value detected from a sensing line to offset the attenuation of the sensed value due to the impedance of the sensing line. Thus, the sensed values generated from different positions along a sensing line are equalized and the touch positioning accuracy of the capacitive touchpad is improved. A capacitive touchpad according to the present invention includes a touch sensor having a plurality of sensing lines connected to a controller which has a front-end circuit for scanning the sensing lines to generate sensed values. Preferably, a sensed value in a first direction is used to determine a position information in the first direction for the equalizer to determine an equalization value according to an equalize function for a second direction, which is used to correct a sensed value in the second direction. Preferably, the equalizer has a memory for storing the equalization value of the equalize function. Preferably, the sensing lines in the first direction have a balanced resistance/capacitance distribution. These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which: FIG. 1 is a schematic view of a typical capacitive touchpad; FIG. 2 is a schematic view of the structure of a typical sensing line; FIG. 3 is the equivalent circuit of the sensing line shown in FIG. 2; FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram showing the distribution of sensed values generated by touching the sensing line of FIG. 2 at different positions thereof; FIG. 5 is a schematic view of a capacitive touchpad having a rectangular touch sensor and interleaving sensing lines; FIG. 6 is a diagram depicting the principle of the present invention to equalize the sensed values of a sensing line of a capacitive touchpad; FIG. 7 a functional block diagram of a capacitive touchpad and a flowchart of a touch positioning method for the capacitive touchpad in an embodiment according to the present invention; FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram showing the sensed values generated from a touch sensor that is touched at different times under a same condition; FIG. 9 is a diagram showing an embodiment of the equalizer according to the present invention; FIG. 10 is a diagram showing a first embodiment of the wiring layout of a touch sensor; FIG. 11 is a diagram showing a second embodiment of the wiring layout of a touch sensor; FIG. 12 is a diagram showing a third embodiment of the wiring layout of a touch sensor; and FIG. 13 is a diagram showing a fourth embodiment of the wiring layout of a touch sensor. FIG. 6 depicts the principle of the present invention to equalize the sensed values of a sensing line of a capacitive touchpad. Taking the touch sensor 110 shown in FIG. 1 for example, the sensing lines X1, X2, . . . , Xm, . . . , XM in the X direction are orthogonal to the sensing lines Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn, . . . , YN in the Y direction. Therefore, positions on the sensing line Xm in the X direction can be defined by the positions y1, y2, . . . , yN of the sensing lines Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn, . . . , YN in the Y direction, as shown by the horizontal coordinates in FIG. 6. The vertical coordinates in FIG. 6 represent the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) counts, which are used to denote the sensed values detected by the controller 120 from the sensing lines of a general capacitive touchpad, and the ADC counts signify the magnitudes of capacitance variation along a particular sensing line. As shown by a curve 310 in FIG. 6, if the sensing line Xm has a significant resistance, the sensed value detected by the controller 120 will attenuate as the distance between the controller 120 and the touch point increases and as a result, the sensed value corresponding to the position y1 on the sensing line Xm will be lower than the sensed value corresponding to the position yN. An equalize function according to the present invention is shown by a curve 320, and has the equalization values corresponding to each of the positions y1, y2 . . . , yN to correct the sensed values corresponding thereto to thereby offset the attenuation effect. A processing unit 340 may correct the curve 310 according to the equalize function represented by the curve 320 to be an equalized curve 330. Actually, the structure of the sensing line Xm is not changed, and the original sensed values generated therefrom still follow the curve 310. However, the sensed values actually detected by a controller are calibrated by a pertinent software or hardware such that the sensed values corresponding to touches at positions y1, y2, . . . , yN on the sensing line Xm are all equal to a certain value S as shown by the curve 330. In an embodiment, the equalize function represented by the curve 320 is obtained from calculation based on the equivalent circuit shown in FIG. 3. In another embodiment, the equalization function represented by the curve 320 is deduced from the sensed values actually detected from the sensing line Xm. In some other embodiments, the sensing lines may be arranged in directions other than the X and Y directions. In some other embodiments, the sensing lines are not necessarily divided into two groups that are orthogonal to each other, but two groups that intersect each other such that either one of the two groups can be used to define different positions on any single sensing line in the other group. The sensing lines in the embodiments hereinafter are arranged in the orthogonal X and Y directions to facilitate explanation so that features of the present invention can be more readily understood. FIG. 7 shows a functional block diagram of a capacitive touchpad and a flowchart of a touch positioning method for the capacitive touchpad in an embodiment according to the present invention. For simplicity, it is assumed in this embodiment that the capacitive touchpad includes sensing lines in the Y direction having a balanced resistance/capacitance distribution. In other words, the attenuation effect on the sensing lines in the Y direction is excluded. When an object 400 touches a touch sensor 410, a front-end circuit 420 generates a sensed value SX in the X direction and a sensed value SY in the Y direction by scanning the sensing lines. The sensed values SY in the Y direction corresponding to touches at different positions are invariant with respect to positions of the object 400, while the sensed values SX in the X direction attenuate as the distance between the object 400 and the front-end circuit 420 increases. A Y-direction positioning step 440 determines a Y-direction position yn of the object 400 according to the sensed value SY in the Y direction, and information of this Y-direction position yn is provided to an equalizer 430 for the X direction. Based on the Y-direction position yn, the equalizer 430 determines an equalization value K according to an equalize function, and then corrects the sensed value SX in the X direction to be a corrected sensed value S, from which an X-direction positioning step 450 determines an X-direction position Xm of the object 400. The information of X-direction position X m and the Y-direction position yn as well as the sensed values S and SY of the object 400 are provided to a post-processing step 460 for further processing, such as to determine a moving speed or an acceleration of the object 400. Operations in the Y-direction positioning step 440, the X-direction positioning step 450 and the post-processing step 460 are in fact accomplished by the arithmetic unit of the controller and pertain to prior arts. When different positions A, B, C and D in the Y direction at a same position in the X direction of the touch sensor 410 are touched at different times under a same condition, the corresponding sensed values in the X and Y directions are shown in FIG. 8, in which the position A has the largest sensed value in the X direction, the position D has the smallest sensed value in the X direction, and the sensed values in the Y direction are not significantly varied with the different positions A, B, C and D. If the sensed values actually obtained are used for touch positioning, it may be impossible to accurately determine the position of each of A, B, C and D because the X-direction sensed values corresponding to the different positions A, B, C and D are great varied. If a user moves his finger from the position A to the positions B, C and D sequentially, the Y-direction sensed values clearly show a variation in the Y direction corresponding to contacts by the finger at the four positions, so that it can be further determined that the finger has moved in the Y direction. In the X direction, however, if the sensed values actually obtained are used for touch positioning, it may be impossible to accurately determine that the finger has actually stayed at a same position in the X direction. Nevertheless, after applying the aforementioned equalization described with reference to FIG. 7, the corrected X-direction sensed values will be able to clearly show a change of positions, as do the Y-direction sensed values. The equalizer 430 can be realized by hardware, software or a combination thereof, and an embodiment of the equalizer 430 is shown in FIG. 9, in which the sensing lines Y1, Y2, . . . , YN in the Y direction of the touch sensor 410 have a balanced resistance/capacitance distribution, and the controller 120 includes the equalizer 430. As described above, the sensing lines Y1, Y2, . . . , YN in the Y direction having the balanced resistance/capacitance distribution can be achieved with an interleaving wiring layout. FIG. 10 is a diagram showing an example of a wiring layout in which the sensing lines Y1, Y2, . . . , YN are interleaving while the sensing lines X1, X2, . . . , XM in the X direction are arranged in a same direction. FIG. 11 is a diagram showing another wiring layout in which the sensing lines Y1, Y2, . . . , YN in the Y direction are arranged in a same direction and each of them has a U shape to achieve a balanced resistance/capacitance distribution, while the sensing lines X1, X2, . . . , XM in the X direction are still arranged in a same direction. FIG. 12 is a diagram showing yet another wiring layout in which the sensing lines Y1, Y2, . . . , YN in the Y direction are interleaving and each of them has a U shape to achieve a balanced resistance/capacitance distribution, while the sensing lines X1, X2, . . . , XM in the X direction are still arranged in a same direction. The touch sensor 410 shown in FIG. 13 has a rectangular shape, and the sensing lines Y1, Y2, . . . , YN in the Y direction have shorter lengths so as to reduce the resistance/capacitance filtering effect to be one could be ignored, or could be eliminated with a circuit adjustment in order to equalize the sensed values thereof. On the other hand, the sensed values from the sensing lines X1, X2, . . . , XM in the X direction in FIG. 13 can be equalized by applying the aforementioned equalization thereto. Hence, not only can the sensing lines X1, X2, . . . , XM be arranged in a same direction, but also the sensing lines Y1, Y2, . . . , YN can be arranged in a same direction, thereby simplifying the wiring layout of the sensing lines. Referring back to FIG. 9, the controller 120 includes the front-end circuit 420 and the equalizer 430 that is realized by a combination of an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) 340 and a memory 470. The memory 470 stores the equalize function for the X direction, so that the ALU 340 can extract from the memory 470 an equlization value K of the equalize function that corresponds to a Y-direction position yn and thereby correct an X-direction sensed value SX into S, from which an X-direction position Xm can be further determined. The equalize function can be stored in the memory 470 as a lookup table where all the equalization values of the equalize equation are stored, so that the ALU 340 can read the equalization value K by looking it up in the table. In another embodiment, the memory 470 may store only a formula of the equalize function or certain parameters of the equalize function, with which the ALU 340 calculates data it receives to generate corresponding equalization values of the equalize function. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 9, no physical wiring is added to the controller 120, and operations of the equalizer 430 are executed by the ALU 340 and the memory 470 of the controller 120. Hence, no extra cost of hardware is incurred. As demonstrated by the foregoing embodiments, the wiring layout of the touch sensor 410 can be simplified by properly arranging the sensing lines in the Y direction to eliminate variation resulted from attenuation, and using the equalizer 430 to correct the sensed values in the X direction. Another advantage of using the equalizer 430 to correct the sensed values is ease of adjustment thereto. Although a designer of the controller 120 cannot control the degree of attenuation taking place along the sensing lines of the touch sensor 410, the equalize function stored in the controller 120 can be changed at any time, so that the equalize function in the controller 120 can be adjusted according to the touch sensor 410 actually used. Thus, the controller 120 is adaptive to various touch sensors 410 having different specifications, which also relieves the designer of the controller 120 from an otherwise difficult task. While the present invention has been described in conjunction with preferred embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope thereof as set forth in the appended claims. 1.

To usher in a new year of stylish and affordable notebooks, we\u2019re drawing back the curtain on new VivoBook 14 and VivoBook 15 models at CES 2020. Bursting with personality and the latest hardware, these notebooks are ready-made for your connected, creative lifestyle. It\u2019s easy to find a bland and boring notebook that blends in with the crowd, but a notebook that expresses your unique personality is harder to find. The ASUS VivoBook 14 K413 and VivoBook 15 K513 both sport a sleek and detailed metallic lid that\u2019s complemented by one of three striking finishes: Indie Black, Hearty Gold, or Transparent Silver. We wrap the ASUS VivoBook 14 X413 and VivoBook 15 X513, on the other hand, in Cobalt Blue, Dreamy White, or Bespoke Black. For a finishing touch on all these models, we set off the enter key with yellow color blocking underneath the keycap.  Style and power go hand in hand, so we outfitted new VivoBook 14 and 15 notebooks with the latest hardware. At the heart of each model is one of Intel\u2019s 10th Gen CPUs, ranging up to Core i7 chips. For those who like to dabble in light gaming or photo and video editing, we offer models with NVIDIA graphics chips for extra power. A healthy pool of memory is necessary for effective multitasking, so we offer these new VivoBooks with up to 16GB of RAM. To speed up access to commonly-used apps and files, you can select a model with Intel\u2019s unique Optane memory. Finally, optional Wi-Fi 6 networking lets these notebooks take advantage of the latest revolution in cord-free connectivity.  Thanks to a compact, lightweight chassis design, VivoBook 14 and 15 notebooks are easy to use wherever you need to take them. Ultra-slim bezels on three sides of the display allow our engineers to slim down the VivoBook to a surprisingly small footprint. We increased the key travel to 1.4mm to make the backlit keyboard more comfortable to use and included a microphone array that\u2019ll let you interact with voice assistants like Microsoft\u2019s Cortana from up to four meters away. Need to connect the notebook to an external display or a high-speed peripheral? Each has an HDMI and a USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-C port.

For one, these models come with a dual storage array. In addition to the fast PCIe SSD, which makes sure your operating system and favorite programs load quickly, you\u2019ll get a hard disk drive with as much as 2TB of capacity for storing media and other files. The chassis is just wide enough for a full-size keyboard and ASUS NumberPad 2.0, and there\u2019s an SD card reader, as well. Even with that range of capabilities, these notebooks are still quite portable. They weigh in at just 1.7kg.  If a 15\u201d notebook is still a bit too big for your bag, the 14\u201d VivoBook 14 K413 and VivoBook 14 X413 might be more to your liking. They\u2019re slimmer, narrower, and lighter than the 15\u201d models, yet offer the same CPU and GPU options. Instead of a built-in ASUS NumberPad 2.0, we offer 14\u201d VivoBook models with the ASUS NumberPad 2.0, a touchpad that can turn into a handy ten-key input with the tap of a button. Storage options include a PCIe SSD as large as 1TB, and you also get a microSD card reader and a high-speed USB Type-C port to connect external storage to the notebook. VivoBook 14 and VivoBook 15 laptops come equipped with Link to MyASUS, a handy new tool that\u2019s part of the preinstalled MyASUS app. It seamlessly integrates your ASUS PC with compatible mobile devices, boosting your productivity and expanding multitasking possibilities. The File and URL Transfer function within Link to MyASUS lets users seamlessly transfer documents, media or links between devices. Remote File Access can be a lifesaver if you need to grab a file off your PC while you\u2019re out and about, but only have your phone with you. If you\u2019re a multi-tasker, the Mirroring and Screen Extender functions let you work more fluently or make the most of all of the screen space you have at hand. Finally, if you need to call someone while working on your PC, you can seamlessly make or receive phone calls from the MyASUS app running on your laptop, all without digging out your phone from your bag or pocket.

Best of all, NLTK is a free, open source, community-driven project. We\u2019ll use this toolkit to show some basics of the natural language processing field. For the examples below, I\u2019ll assume that we have imported the NLTK toolkit. We can do this like this: import nltk. In this article, we\u2019ll cover the following topics: Sentence tokenization (also called sentence segmentation) is the problem of dividing a string of written language into its component sentences. The idea here looks very simple. In English and some other languages, we can split apart the sentences whenever we see a punctuation mark. However, even in English, this problem is not trivial due to the use of full stop character for abbreviations. When processing plain text, tables of abbreviations that contain periods can help us to prevent incorrect assignment of sentence boundaries. In many cases, we use libraries to do that job for us, so don\u2019t worry too much for the details for now. Example: Let\u2019s look a piece of text about a famous board game called backgammon. Backgammon is one of the oldest known board games. Its history can be traced back nearly 5,000 years to archeological discoveries in the Middle East. It is a two player game where each player has fifteen checkers which move between twenty-four points according to the roll of two dice. To apply a sentence tokenization with NLTK we can use the nltk.sent_tokenize function. As an output, we get the 3 component sentences separately. Word tokenization (also called word segmentation) is the problem of dividing a string of written language into its component words. In English and many other languages using some form of Latin alphabet, space is a good approximation of a word divider. However, we still can have problems if we only split by space to achieve the wanted results. Some English compound nouns are variably written and sometimes they contain a space. In most cases, we use a library to achieve the wanted results, so again don\u2019t worry too much for the details. Example: Let\u2019s use the sentences from the previous step and see how we can apply word tokenization on them. We can use the nltk.word_tokenize function. Output: For grammatical reasons, documents can contain different forms of a word such as drive, drives, driving. Also, sometimes we have related words with a similar meaning, such as nation, national, nationality. The goal of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form. Source: https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html Examples: The result of this mapping applied on a text will be something like that: Stemming and lemmatization are special cases of normalization. However, they are different from each other. Stemming usually refers to a crude heuristic process that chops off the ends of words in the hope of achieving this goal correctly most of the time, and often includes the removal of derivational affixes. Lemmatization usually refers to doing things properly with the use of a vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, normally aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma. Source: https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html The difference is that a stemmer operates without knowledge of the context, and therefore cannot understand the difference between words which have different meaning depending on part of speech. But the stemmers also have some advantages, they are easier to implement and usually run faster. Also, the reduced \u201caccuracy\u201d may not matter for some applications. Examples: After we know what\u2019s the difference, let\u2019s see some examples using the NLTK tool. Output: Stop words are words which are filtered out before or after processing of text. When applying machine learning to text, these words can add a lot of noise. That\u2019s why we want to remove these irrelevant words. Stop words usually refer to the most common words such as \u201cand\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d, \u201ca\u201d in a language, but there is no single universal list of stopwords. The list of the stop words can change depending on your application. The NLTK tool has a predefined list of stopwords that refers to the most common words. If you use it for your first time, you need to download the stop words using this code: nltk.download(\u201cstopwords\u201d). Once we complete the downloading, we can load the stopwords package from the nltk.corpus and use it to load the stop words. Output: Let\u2019s see how we can remove the stop words from a sentence. Output: If you\u2019re not familiar with the list comprehensions in Python. Here is another way to achieve the same result. However, keep in mind that list comprehensions are faster because they are optimized for the Python interpreter to spot a predictable pattern during looping. You might wonder why we convert our list into a set. Set is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without any particular order. The search operation in a set is much faster than the search operation in a list. For a small number of words, there is no big difference, but if you have a large number of words it\u2019s highly recommended to use the set type. If you want to learn more about the time consuming between the different operations for the different data structures you can look at this awesome cheat sheet. A regular expression, regex, or regexp is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Let\u2019s see some basics. Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python\u2019s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write '\\\\\\\\' as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \\\\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\\\ inside a regular Python string literal. The solution is to use Python\u2019s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r'. So r\"\\n\" is a two-character string containing '\\' and 'n', while \"\\n\" is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually, patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation. Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=regex We can use regex to apply additional filtering to our text. For example, we can remove all the non-words characters. In many cases, we don\u2019t need the punctuation marks and it\u2019s easy to remove them with regex. In Python, the re module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those in Perl. We can use the re.sub function to replace the matches for a pattern with a replacement string. Let\u2019s see an example when we replace all non-words with the space character. Output: A regular expression is a powerful tool and we can create much more complex patterns. If you want to learn more about regex I can recommend you to try these 2 web apps: regexr, regex101. Machine learning algorithms cannot work with raw text directly, we need to convert the text into vectors of numbers. This is called feature extraction. The bag-of-words model is a popular and simple feature extraction technique used when we work with text. It describes the occurrence of each word within a document. To use this model, we need to: Any information about the order or structure of words is discarded. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a bag of words. This model is trying to understand whether a known word occurs in a document, but don\u2019t know where is that word in the document. The intuition is that similar documents have similar contents. Also, from a content, we can learn something about the meaning of the document. Let\u2019s see what are the steps to create a bag-of-words model. In this example, we\u2019ll use only four sentences to see how this model works. In the real-world problems, you\u2019ll work with much bigger amounts of data. 1. Load the Data Let\u2019s say that this is our data and we want to load it as an array. To achieve this we can simply read the file and split it by lines. Output: 2. Design the Vocabulary Let\u2019s get all the unique words from the four loaded sentences ignoring the case, punctuation, and one-character tokens. These words will be our vocabulary (known words). We can use the CountVectorizer class from the sklearn library to design our vocabulary. We\u2019ll see how we can use it after reading the next step, too. 3. Create the Document Vectors Next, we need to score the words in each document. The task here is to convert each raw text into a vector of numbers. After that, we can use these vectors as input for a machine learning model. The simplest scoring method is to mark the presence of words with 1 for present and 0 for absence. Now, let\u2019s see how we can create a bag-of-words model using the mentioned above CountVectorizer class. Output: Here are our sentences. Now we can see how the bag-of-words model works. The complexity of the bag-of-words model comes in deciding how to design the vocabulary of known words (tokens) and how to score the presence of known words. Designing the VocabularyWhen the vocabulary size increases, the vector representation of the documents also increases. In the example above, the length of the document vector is equal to the number of known words. In some cases, we can have a huge amount of data and in this cases, the length of the vector that represents a document might be thousands or millions of elements. Furthermore, each document may contain only a few of the known words in the vocabulary. Therefore the vector representations will have a lot of zeros. These vectors which have a lot of zeros are called sparse vectors. They require more memory and computational resources. We can decrease the number of the known words when using a bag-of-words model to decrease the required memory and computational resources. We can use the text cleaning techniques we\u2019ve already seen in this article before we create our bag-of-words model: Another more complex way to create a vocabulary is to use grouped words. This changes the scope of the vocabulary and allows the bag-of-words model to get more details about the document. This approach is called n-grams. An n-gram is a sequence of a number of items (words, letter, numbers, digits, etc.). In the context of text corpora, n-grams typically refer to a sequence of words. A unigram is one word, a bigram is a sequence of two words, a trigram is a sequence of three words etc. The \u201cn\u201d in the \u201cn-gram\u201d refers to the number of the grouped words. Only the n-grams that appear in the corpus are modeled, not all possible n-grams. ExampleLet\u2019s look at the all bigrams for the following sentence: The office building is open today All the bigrams are: The bag-of-bigrams is more powerful than the bag-of-words approach. Scoring WordsOnce, we have created our vocabulary of known words, we need to score the occurrence of the words in our data. We saw one very simple approach - the binary approach (1 for presence, 0 for absence). Some additional scoring methods are: One problem with scoring word frequency is that the most frequent words in the document start to have the highest scores. These frequent words may not contain as much \u201cinformational gain\u201d to the model compared with some rarer and domain-specific words. One approach to fix that problem is to penalize words that are frequent across all the documents. This approach is called TF-IDF. TF-IDF, short for term frequency-inverse document frequency is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus. The TF-IDF scoring value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, but it is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word. Let\u2019s see the formula used to calculate a TF-IDF score for a given term x within a document y. Now, let\u2019s split this formula a little bit and see how the different parts of the formula work. ExampleIn Python, we can use the TfidfVectorizer class from the sklearn library to calculate the TF-IDF scores for given documents. Let\u2019s use the same sentences that we have used with the bag-of-words example. Output: Again, I\u2019ll add the sentences here for an easy comparison and better understanding of how this approach is working. In this blog post, you learn the basics of the NLP for text.

Consider the best new touchscreen phones, in which the user interface is a large capacitive sensing screen that differentiates a flick from a tap and tracks the motion of your finger but doesn't track your ear.  Sensors are at the heart of these systems. They sense the environment and user behavior, enabling the product to respond in an intuitive but reliable way. However, the sensor films themselves aren't intelligent. They don't even collect data. They only sense. They aren't capable of differentiating between useful and useless data or discriminating between the quality of different types of inputs.  Truth be told, these sensor films hardly sense at all. They really just project an electric field created by an intelligent capacitive sensing chip. This type of capacitive sensing is known as projected capacitive technology, and it's used in the most advanced capacitive touchscreen solutions. Figure 1  shows and example of how a projected capacitive touchscreen works.   View the full-size image This is not to say that the sensors themselves are not complex. On the contrary,  a capacitive touchscreen sensor consists of a large array of indium tin oxide (ITO) conductors on one or more layers of glass or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic. Figure 2  presents an example of a touchscreen sensor construction.   View the full-size image The good optical clarity and low resistivity of ITO make it the perfect conductor for creating a touchscreen. When the ITO sensor is connected to a capacitive sensing chip with a suitably high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), it can accurately sense minute changes in capacitance. A finger's presence for instance is on the order of a picoFarad (1012  Farads).  It is typically accompanied by background capacitances of 10's of nanoFarads (109 Farads). This situation makes the sensing environment challenging and mandates an exceptionally high SNR. Charge transfer technology is well suited to high SNR capacitive sensing systems. It allows the capacitive system to sense minute changes in capacitance\u2013even from a finger as it approaches the phone before it touches it or from the touch of a fingernail. Charge transfer technology enables high SNR by using a pair of sensing electrodes for each capacitive channel. One is a transmit electrode into which a charge consisting of logic pulses is driven in burst mode. The receive electrode couples to the emitter via the overlying panel dielectric. When a finger touches the panel, the field coupling is reduced and touch is detected.  Most charge signal acquisition techniques leave the charge lines hot (sensitive to the touch) during signal conversion. The current on the sensor edge wiring can be included as part of the position calculation, introducing positional inaccuracy to the measurement.  The contribution of the edge wiring increases with the length of the routing between the sensor and the driver chip and becomes seriously problematic if the distance exceeds a few centimeters. The charge transfer technique holds the receive lines at zero potential during the charge acquisition process and solves this problem, effectively restricting the transfer of charges to those between the transmitter X  and receiver Y  electrodes at the point of interest in the main sensor area.  This \u201ccharge-transfer\u201d signal-acquisition technique uses individual resistive one-dimensional stripes to create a touchscreen. These stripes can be read either in parallel or sequentially, since the connections to these stripes are independent of one another. There is an interpolated coupling between adjacent lumped electrode elements and an object such as a finger.  The charge-transfer technique restricts signal acquisition to the immediate vicinity where a row and column electrode couple to each other. This localized coupling means that all other parts of the row and column are largely not touch sensitive at the time the signal is acquired, literally enabling true, unlimited multi-touch capability.1 Figure 3  shows an example of a charge transfer.   View the full-size image Mutual vs. Self Capacitance   There are two approaches to determining finger position with a projected capacitive touchscreen: measuring self capacitance and measuring mutual capacitance. Touchscreen solutions that measure self capacitance measure an entire row or column for capacitive change.  Self capacitance works OK for single-touch systems, but with multi-touch systems there is no way to resolve the positional ambiguity that results from more than one simultaneous touch on different parts of the screen.  For example, if a user touches on the capacitive grid at locations X1, Y1 and X2, Y2, the energized lines simply tell the chip that X1, X2, Y1, Y2 lines have all been touched. It doesn't know the combination thereof. It could be that the chip reports X1, Y2 and X2, Y1 were the touch locations. This problem is known as ghosting.  Another problem with self-capacitance touchscreens is the snapping effect. It happens when tracking two touches moving towards a shared row or column electrode; the reported coordinates tend to \u201csnap\u201d to that electrode causing a strong nonlinearity and poor user feel. In contrast, mutual capacitance measurement uses an orthogonal matrix of transmit and receive electrodes arranged as an array of multiple smaller touch nodes created by the geometry of the electrode structure.  In a mutual capacitance based system, each touch is uniquely detected as an xy coordinate pair, whereas in a self capacitance system, the detection of X and Y coordinates of a touch is independent.  If two touches are present in a mutual capacitance system, this would be detected as (X1,Y1) and (X2,Y2), whereas in a self-capacitance system it would be detected as (X1,X2,Y1,Y2), leaving two potential combinations of coordinates. The self-capacitance ghosting problem is exponential and becomes impossible to solve as you transition to three or more touches.  A mutual capacitive array is interpreted as a complete touch surface that maintains the ability to resolve multiple touch points within each individual \u201csmall\u201d screen. Because the capacitive coupling at each point in the matrix can be measured independently, it means that there is no ambiguity in the reported coordinates for multiple touches. It is then technically possible to have unlimited touch recognition. Figure 4  compares mutual vs self capacitance.   View the full-size image Charge-transfer signal acquisition, combined with a mutual-capacitance measurement technique, provides a superior SNR and better tolerance to parasitic capacitance, allowing weak signals, such as capacitance conducted through a fingernail, coin or stylus, to be processed. Sensor Resolution   Sensor resolution, the ability to a resolve passive conductive stylus, can be directly linked to the electrode pattern or ITO sensor design. A high-resolution pattern can be formed by having an array of vertical transmit bars separated by a dielectric to a second layer, which contains a horizontal array of receiving lines.  In each location the bars cross, a parallel plate capacitor or sensing electrode is formed.2  In order to maximize the resolution and SNR of this pattern, to detect a 2-mm passive stylus tip for instance, it is important to optimize the density of electrodes. Adding more capacitive channels in each axis for a given screen size can have a beneficial effect even though the sensor is more complex to manufacture. More channels will result in a higher SNR. The optimum row and column pitch of the electrodes should approximate the tip-to-tip distance between thumb and forefinger when pinched together, divided by two (about 5 mm or less). This means that a 4.3-inch screen in a 16:9 aspect ratio should ideally have 19 rows by 11 columns, totaling 209 mutual capacitance electrodes.3  Increasing the electrode density also allows a more qualitative interpretation of the data. For example, a 200+ channel matrix makes it possible to process the \u201csize\u201d and \u201cshape\u201d of the touch, allowing the end user to draw a picture or execute a signature. With a sufficiently high refresh rate (200 Hz), the technology can even support full-speed signature and handwriting recognition with as small as a 2-mm stylus.  While high sensitivity and resolution vastly improves the screen's flexibility, it also introduces the problem of selectivity. The entire surface of the touchscreen measures any small change in capacitance resulting from any charged object (finger, ear, face) that is even near the surface of the sensor, whether intentional or unintentional.  The challenge is to collect the data, discard useless data and utilize useful data in a selective and accurate way. Introducing selectivity and accuracy involves arranging and measuring the change in capacitance in a meaningful way, while also acquiring enough data and applying appropriate algorithms to allow for qualitative differentiation.  Multi-touch: How many is too many?   Two touches allow objects to be stretched, squeezed, and rotated. One might wonder what is the utility of processing five or 10 touches simultaneously, when you can barely fit three fingers on the phone?   The answer goes back to the notion of making the sensor selective\u2013able to interpret the quality or size of a touch and to suppress accidental on unwanted inputs. A true multi-touch technology allows intended touches to be identified and interpreted (such as flick vs. tap). It also allows unintended touches to be identified and rejected. On its own, a capacitive touchscreen sensor has no idea what is touching it or why. It cannot distinguish between a finger, ear, face, elbow, or butterfly. Thus, it's possible for the end user to issue accidental commands to the phone by just using it: gripping its edges or pressing it to his/her ear or face.  Some of the \u201cextra\u201d touch points in a true multi-touch solution can be assigned to unintended touches. Suppressed touches must be tracked and stay suppressed even if they stray into the active region.   This means the controller must be able to uniquely and unambiguously resolve, classify, and track many touches at once. This enables a user to comfortably hold a small product with some amount of finger/screen overlap, while also allowing the touchscreen to operate normally.   Face and grip suppression algorithms can be used that identify and reject unintentional input from the user's face or ear or from fingers gripping the edges of the phone. Grip suppression is quite tricky, as it isn't as simple as just ignoring presses at the edges.  In actuality, the chip has to be smart enough to determine the touches from a grip at the edges, track them as they move, and ensure that they don't trigger false presses. All the while the chip needs to keep the whole screen active for multi-touch support, even as the correct touches move to the edges where the grip occurs.  Gesture processing algorithms that calculate and interpret the xy coordinates of a stream of physically present data from each of the 10 unique touch points to execute gesture commands such as tap, drag, drop, zoom, rotate, or flick\u2013based on the speed of the gesture and the xy positions in the data stream. Another potential use of the underlying many-touch data is to recognize shapes on the touch surface. This allows all kinds of potentially useful interface enhancements. Basic shape recognition for a nose, cheek, or even an ear allows further suppression of real-world situations that would otherwise falsely trigger the touchscreen. As more touches can be uniquely identified and reported to the host, the applications will start making use of multiple touch data. Noise and System Issues   As noted earlier, capacitive touchscreen controllers measure very small changes in the row to column coupling capacitance. The way the controller performs the measurement has a strong influence on the susceptibility of the controller to external noise. One common noise generator encountered with touchscreens is the LCD itself. It often has voltage transients measured as several volts with rise/fall times measured in microseconds. Using the right type of capacitive-to-digital conversion and noise suppression algorithms, it's possible to reject most of the noise at source. Another approach is to use a sensor electrode pattern that uses two ITO layers but is self shielding from behind.  This approach saves cost by eliminating the need for an extra shield layer of ITO while still renderings the sensor immune to the noisy LCD surface. The second most problematic noise source is found with \u201cfloating\u201d power supplies that often capacitively couple several hundred volts of distorted 50/60-Hz waveform relative to earth, into the entire touchscreen device. When a user touches the device, the sensor effectively becomes part of a capacitive voltage divider, contaminating the measurements with huge amounts of low-frequency noise. Again, with clever chip design and noise suppression algorithms can eliminate this effect.  Calibrating touch  Although many touchscreen solutions require the factory and/or the end user to calibrate them before use, solutions are available with self-calibration algorithms that allow the chip to operate independently of any user or manufacturing calibration. Signal drift can occur because of changes in the unknown electrode capacitance and Cs sampling capacitors over time, often resulting from changes in temperature or humidity, and causing false detections, non-detections, and sensitivity shifts.   Drift compensation algorithms compensate using a slew-rate limited change to the reference level; the threshold and hysteresis values are slaved to this reference. Once an object is sensed, the drift compensation mechanism ceases since the signal is legitimately high, and therefore should not cause the reference level to change.4,5,6 Figure 5  illustrates drift compensation.   View the full-size image ITO sensors are the heart  Capacitive touchscreens will likely make their way into products not even imagined today. Consumers are demanding that user interfaces interact with them in an intuitive, effortless, and reliable way.  ITO sensors are at the heart of the solution. Exploiting these exceptionally sensitive sensors requires thoughtful construction, fast performance, and innovative algorithms, embodied in highly intelligent, capacitive touchscreen controller chips that can deliver high channel density, a high SNR, and a multi-touch capability.
